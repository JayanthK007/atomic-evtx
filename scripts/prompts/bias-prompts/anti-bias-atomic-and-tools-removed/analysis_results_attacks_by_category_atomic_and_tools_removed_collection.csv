Directory Name,AI Response
Copy a sensitive File over Administrative share with Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - One notable suspicious command identified is the use of PowerShell to copy a file:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {copy-item -Path ""\\127.0.0.1\C$\Windows\temp\Easter_Bunny.password"" -Destination ""$Env:TEMP\Easter_egg.password""}
     ```
   - This command executes a copy operation from a network path to a local temporary directory. Copying files using PowerShell over a network could indicate lateral movement or data staging for exfiltration, especially with unusual file names suggesting sensitive content (e.g., ""Easter_Bunny.password"").

2. **Process Creation Pattern:**
   - There is a series of rapid process executions by `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the same user ""SERVER002\admin_test."" While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, excessive instances (especially without clear justification) might suggest process hiding or command line abuses.

3. **User Context:**
   - Activity is consistently occurring under the context of ""SERVER002\admin_test"" with high integrity level processes, which could potentially indicate compromised privileged access.

4. **Overall System Behavior:**
   - The presence of scheduled tasks such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` processes are standard for system maintenance and software updates, indicating typical system activity in maintaining software integrity.

### Assessment of Events:
- The PowerShell log entries demonstrate potential scripting activity that could align with suspicious behavior given their nature and target file. However, this alone does not definitively confirm malicious intent without more context (e.g., the purpose of the copied file, or corresponding network activity logs).
- The frequent execution and short intervals of some system and PowerShell processes might be worth further examination.

### Determination:
Based on the analysis, while there are indicators that warrant closer scrutiny, such as the PowerShell scripting activity and the repetitive spawning of certain processes, there is not sufficient evidence to conclusively label these logs as definitively malicious without additional context or corroborating evidence.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Investigate Further:** Conduct more thorough checks into the `admin_test` account activities, including interactive logons, network connections, and any file modifications that intersect with the suspicious PowerShell activity.
- **Check Endpoint Security:** Ensure endpoint security tools (antivirus, EDR solutions) are checked for any flagged activities around the timestamps of these events.
- **Review Network Traffic:** If available, analyze network traffic corresponding to these log times to check for any suspicious external communications.
- **Correlate with Logs from Other Sources:** Consider correlating these logs with other log sources (e.g., firewall, proxy, SIEM) to find potential indicators of exfiltration or unauthorized access patterns. 

In conclusion, the logs highlight potentially suspicious activity that necessitates further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
ESXi - Remove Syslog remote,"Upon careful analysis of the provided logs, several findings merit attention with regard to potential suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a command utilizing `plink.exe` to extract IP addresses from a syslog configuration, which is unusual behavior for a typical PowerShell operation. `plink.exe` is a command-line interface to the PuTTY back ends which can be used to execute remote commands via SSH, and its presence could potentially indicate lateral movement or data exfiltration if unauthorized.
   - The command execution involves accessing a remote server (`file.local`) with root privileges using `plink.exe`, which can be concerning if not part of regular administrative practices. However, no unauthorized targets were identified within the contents of the data.001 path.

2. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The Event ID 19 within the system logs for Windows Update Client suggests a regular update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, indicating that the threat database is currently being maintained up-to-date, which contributes positively to security posture.
   - The application logs do not highlight any anomalies outside of typical Windows operations.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of process creation for various system applications such as `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `whoami.exe`, as well as Microsoft Edge Update processes and `CompatTelRunner.exe`. While these processes can be legitimate, monitoring for persistence through such processes is advisable.
   - The significant aspect here is the execution of `Plink.exe` under `SERVER002\admin_test`, associated with PowerShell commands observed earlier.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Security log events, including Event ID 4624 (successful logon), are noted with the SYSTEM user context and NT AUTHORITY, indicating usage or execution tied to system-level operations.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of special privileges which are standard for SYSTEM logons, albeit these should be monitored to ensure they align with expected administrative actions.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**
Given the context and contents of the logs, the overall activity is flagged as **SUSPICIOUS**. The utilization of `plink.exe` and the complexity of PowerShell scripts warrant a deeper investigation to confirm whether these actions are authorized by IT operations or potentially malicious actions. Specific focus should be directed toward:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user context and associated operations.
- Analyzing the sequence and intent of `plink.exe` executions.
- Reviewing logs and settings to confirm no unauthorized configurations or data movement.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Engage with the system administrators or privileged account managers to verify legitimate usage intentions behind the observed PowerShell scripts.
- Conduct a threat hunt to ascertain if any unauthorized changes have been made or if external connections have been established from `Server002`.
- Implement alerts for any future unauthorized PowerShell executions and external tool usage such as `plink.exe`.

Further detailed investigation is needed to determine if any of these activities are part of a security breach."
Compress Data for Exfiltration With PowerShell,"Based on a detailed examination of the Windows event logs provided, here is a thorough breakdown of potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624** (Logon Event):
   - Logon type 5 indicates a service logon, which is typically benign if conducted by system processes like `services.exe`.

2. **Event ID 4672** (Privileges Assigned):
   - It shows privileges such as `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, and others being assigned, which are common for SYSTEM processes. This activity aligns with typical behavior when a service leverages high-level privileges.

3. **Event ID 5379** (Credential Validation Attempt):
   - Numerous failed attempts to access `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` credentials are noted. The return code suggests a failed attempt, which in itself isn't explicitly malicious but warrants a closer look for patterns of brute force or suspicious access attempts.

4. **Event ID 4798** (Group Membership Enumeration):
   - Instances of group membership enumeration for accounts such as `Administrator`, `admin_test`, and others. This activity can be routine, but if unsolicited, could be an indication of reconnaissance activity.

### System Log Analysis:
- The system primarily logs Windows Updates and Defender Antivirus updates, which seem consistent with legitimate automated update behavior.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation Events**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` could indicate enumeration activity. However, no direct evidence suggests these were executed for malicious purposes based on this data alone.
   - The most crucial event here is the PowerShell command executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {dir $env:USERPROFILE -Recurse | Compress-Archive -DestinationPath $env:USERPROFILE\\data-data-ps.zip}
     ```
     - This PowerShell command scans and compresses user profile directories. The script does not seem to be inherently malicious but might suggest data exfiltration preparation.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The repetitive PowerShell actions aligning with `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression` appear legitimate within the execution context of data compression.

### Application Log Analysis:
- Routine logs indicating security software status (`Windows Defender on`) and Edge Update service logs (""Service stopped"") are seen, which align with standard operational logs.

### Conclusion:
- **Suspicious**: While there is no explicit evidence of malicious activity, the combination of PowerShell compression and enumeration actions by `admin_test` presents a slight indication of potential reconnaissance or data collection behavior.
- More investigation is necessary focusing on user `admin_test`, detailing their usual activity, and confirming if the actions align with expected behavior. It is advised to check for unusual network activity around this time for any data transfer attempt indications.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the information available, I recommend increased monitoring of server `Server002` and user `admin_test`, and correlating this event with any potential data egress channels to verify the intent of the observed activities."
Recon information for export with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior indicative of possible malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - The repeated starting and stopping of Microsoft Edge Update processes (events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is noted. Edge Update processes such as these are common, regular updates or maintenance operations might generate a cluster of activities in logs, which is expected behavior in keeping the browser updated with the latest security patches.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple entries indicate that a time adjustment was made on the system. These are normal operations dictated by the Windows Time Service and were correctly logged under legitimate services (e.g., `svchost.exe`). No manipulation or exploitation attempts like time manipulation were observed that could be suggestive of any obfuscation attempts by an adversary.

3. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed that gathered information on services, environment variables, and processes, writing them to temporary files. Despite this potentially being legitimate administrative action, it warrants a cautious approach due to PowerShell's dual-use nature which could be used for both administrative tasks and malicious scripting.
   - The execution context (`admin_test`) was used, which may suggest authorized administrative activity unless proven otherwise.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs do not indicate any suspicious processes executed outside standard system locations or with unusual command-line arguments. There are expected administrative and system maintenance-related activities (like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and kernel activities).

### Assessment:

- **Repetitive Edge Updates**: Observed Edge update-related events are typical for browser updates and system functionality. The logs show actions such as update services starting or stopping without accompanying unauthorized access attempts or privilege escalations, suggesting maintenance activity.

- **Time Changes and Power Management**: The logs relating to time changes indicate standard operations, likely time synchronization adjustments performed by typical Windows services.

- **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell activity is more controlled and lacks elements like remote administration or evidence of privilege escalation, which are components commonly associated with malicious scripts. However, if the `admin_test` account is not the regular admin account or if its access was unexpected at this time, it would be prudent to further investigate to verify the legitimacy of these actions.

### Guidance:

Given the above analysis, the overall activity logged seems routine and aligns with expected operations for system updates, maintenance scripting, and time synchronization. However, vigilance regarding the PowerShell use from the `admin_test` account is advised.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Reason**: Although no clear evidence of compromise was found, PowerShell use needs verification. Investigate the origin and authorization of the PowerShell commands associated with `admin_test` to ensure they were not executed as part of unauthorized access. This verification could confirm benign actions or uncover potential misuse requiring further review or remediation."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with 7zip,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, here is a detailed analysis highlighting suspicious or anomalous behavior, indicating potential compromise:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The execution of multiple `cmd.exe` instances is observed with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in the logs:
     - An instance of `cmd.exe` executed with a command line that checks for the presence of 7-Zip (`""cmd.exe"" /c if not exist ""%%ProgramFiles%%\\7-zip\\7z.exe"" (exit /b 1)`).
     - Another instance involved a complex command chain: 
       - Creating directories and files
       - Writing ""This file will be encrypted"" to a text file
       - Creating an archive with `7z.exe` and specifying a password (`-pblue`).

   - These actions could indicate attempts at obfuscation, potential file exfiltration/preparation for encryption (possibly ransomware behavior), or unauthorized usage of 7-Zip with a password.

2. **Processes Indicating Potential Enumeration or Information Gathering:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests an enumeration behavior common in reconnaissance or penetration activities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool commonly used to manage event configuration and logs, executed with `SERVER002\admin_test`. Malicious actors could use this tool to clear logs or hide their activities.

4. **Miscellaneous Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `conhost.exe` paired with `cmd.exe`, `7z.exe`, and other utilities. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process, its association with these actions might indicate a shell or console manipulation.

### Assessment of Malicious Activities

- The script-like command in `cmd.exe` for encryption preparation activities under a suspicious user context, alongside use of tools like `whoami`, `wevtutil`, and `7z` with password protection, suggests potential malicious intentions.

- The timing of these events with recon-style tool usage provides a cohesive narrative of potential unauthorized exploration or configuration changes.

### Conclusion and Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The observed activities, particularly the sophisticated cmd chain, suggest malicious behavior. The combination of reconnaissance commands, manipulation of files, and potential usage of encryption hints at a ransomware or data exfiltration attempt.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Incident Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`).
   - Review user account `admin_test` activity, and suspend/reset its credentials.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deep dive into the system for unauthorized changes, malware signatures, and persistence mechanisms.
   - Check for data compromise or exfiltration.

3. **Log Review and Monitoring:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring across critical systems.
   - Set alerts for similar patterns (suspicious PowerShell or cmd.exe usage).

4. **Communicate with Stakeholders:**
   - Notify the incident response team and relevant stakeholders about the potential breach.
   - Initiate a post-incident review and harden the environment against similar threats in the future."
Utilize Clipboard to store or execute commands from,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The logs show several benign processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe` executed, which are standard Windows applications.
   - `cmd.exe` is observed with command-line arguments performing clipboard operations and file writes (`cmd.exe /c dir | clip & echo ""data"" > %temp%\data.txt & clip < %temp%\data.txt`). This behavior of using `clip.exe` to manipulate clipboard data and write to temporary files can be used for data exfiltration or reconnaissance within the environment.
   - Frequent execution of `whoami.exe` indicates actions to gather information about the current user context, which can be typical for interactive sessions but may be worth understanding the context in which this occurred.

2. **Unusual Patterns or Anomalies:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used for managing event logs, are found running. This is potentially suspicious as it can be used for clearing logs or altering them.
   - There is a notable manipulation of system time as indicated by logs from the Kernel-General provider, which involves altering timestamps. This feature is often used by malware to evade detection based on timestamps and can indicate malicious activity.
  
3. **Privileges and Integrity Levels:**
   - The processes are running with high integrity, suggesting that they have considerable privileges, which if misused, could lead to significant security breaches. 

4. **Security Logs:**
   - There is manipulation of the system clock, documented by Event ID 4616, involving `svchost.exe`. Such behavior can be associated with attempts to obscure malicious actions in time-bound security logs.

5. **Mitigating Factors:**
   - While the usage of administrative tools and the modification of the system clock could point to benign administrative activity, these behaviors can also be indicative of an adversary trying to cover tracks or perform reconnaissance.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

The logs present some actions that align with potential malicious activity, such as system time manipulation and commands for potential data manipulation or reconnaissance. Although these could correspond to legitimate administrative tasks, without contextual information regarding the purpose and time frame, these actions are suspicious.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a further detailed investigation to gather context around the execution of `cmd.exe` with mentioned arguments, along with `clip.exe` and time modification activity.
- Identify if there was a legitimate administrative task that called for these activities; if not, they may require immediate attention.
- Enable more detailed logging, such as command-line logging and process creation events, for more visibility into activities.
- Consider deploying or reviewing any EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solution data for anomalies correlating with the timeline of these logs.
- Consult with the administrator for potential security policy violations or missing patches that could have been leveraged during these events."
Execute Commands from Clipboard using PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs and a thorough analysis, here's the assessment:

### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain an executed command: `powershell.exe & {echo Get-Process | clip; Get-Clipboard | iex}`.
   - This command is suspicious because it involves clipboard operations and uses `Get-Clipboard`, followed by `iex` (Invoke-Expression), which can be used to execute expressions from clipboards. This type of command is often associated with malicious activity, like executing malicious code taken from the clipboard.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several processes are executed by `admin_test`, such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, which are legitimate system utilities.
   - Notably, the PowerShell process with the suspicious command is initiated by the `wsmprovhost.exe` process (Windows Remote Management framework), suggesting potential remote command execution.
   - The clipboard operations using `clip.exe` are confirmed in these logs, as they appear to be initiated by PowerShell.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs do not indicate any direct suspicious activity. The entry from the ""edgeupdate"" provider just indicates a service stop event.
   
4. **Security & System Logs:**
   - No records provided for security and system logs.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):** 
  - The specific usage of `clip` and `Get-Clipboard | iex` within PowerShell scripts where remote execution is involved raises red flags for potential malware execution.
  - The context of clipboard management combined with execution (`iex`) is a known technique for malware attacks, often seen with droppers or in phishing attacks loading scripts or payloads from the clipboard.

- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - The unusual use of PowerShell for clipboard manipulation and expression invocation suggests an attempt to execute potentially malicious scripts on the server.

### Guidance:

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Analyze user activity for `admin_test` for recent suspicious activities or unexpected access.
  - Check network logs for any connections from this host to external endpoints that may be related to exfiltration or C2 communication.
  - Perform a full system scan with updated anti-malware tools and review system integrity.
  
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential data loss or malware spread.
  - Review and strengthen PowerShell execution policies and consider implementing more restrictive measures such as logging all PowerShell activity and using constrained language mode.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

The command usage pattern detected is strongly indicative of malicious activity, particularly involving remote execution and potential data compromise through clipboard manipulation, warrants classification as such."
Office365 - Remote Mail Collected,"Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. The PowerShell logs show the use of PowerShell scripts executing various commands. These include:
   - Retrieving an access token via `Get-AzAccessToken`.
   - Creating a self-signed certificate with `New-SelfSignedCertificate`.
   - Registering a new application with `New-MgApplication` and creating roles for Microsoft Graph.
   - These operations are somewhat advanced and typically seen in automation scripts or administrative tasks.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. There is repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing Windows event logs. While not inherently malicious, its usage should be scrutinized in non-routine contexts.
2. Processes like `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed, indicating possible enumeration behavior or gathering environment information. 
3. The PowerShell command sequence observed:
   - Use of `Get-AzAccessToken` to obtain a token, suggesting attempts to interface with Azure services.
   - Script for creating new application and service principal via Microsoft Graph API.
   - The PowerShell command structure and execution sequence could indicate an automated task or potentially unauthorized access/interaction with resources.
  
### Security Logs:
1. Logon type 3 indicates network logons—a common occurrence for remote connections or service executions.

### Analysis:
- **Script Execution:** The PowerShell script clearly attempts to interact with Azure and Microsoft Graph APIs, potentially accessing user information. While this can be legitimate in specific admin or DevOps contexts, without a clear business justification, such scripts can indicate a compliance breach or unauthorized access attempt.
- **Process Execution:** The usage of `wevtutil.exe` is worth addressing. Multiple invocations within a short window could imply event log tampering or information gathering.
- **Role Assignment:** Assigning roles or retrieving user messages with Microsoft Graph is a privileged operation—appropriate only if performed by a legitimate, authorized script.
  
### Conclusion:
The logs show potentially suspicious behavior:
- Advanced PowerShell scripting manipulating Azure AD and Microsoft Graph.
- Uses self-signed certificates, access tokens, and ServicePrincipal manipulation.
- Elevated rights usage by the `admin_test` account in these contexts should be justified, monitored, and restricted if no legitimate purpose is identified.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity lacks sufficient context to confirm as benign but indicates possible misuse of administrative privileges or scripting for unauthorized data access. Further investigation is recommended:
- Validate the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts and their intent.
- Review access and permissions for the `admin_test` account.
- Confirm if these operations comply with organizational IT policies regarding Azure and Microsoft services interactions.

Considering these aspects will help ensure the interpreted logs align with expected business activities, thereby ruling out or confirming any malicious activity."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with winzip,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the System, Application, Sysmon, Security, and Windows PowerShell log channels, several observations can be made, particularly from the Sysmon logs which provide detailed process execution data:

1. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating script execution or command line activity. The command line includes conditional checks and manipulation of files and directories, seen in entries such as:
     - **Cmd.exe Execution**: `cmd.exe /c ""if not exist ""%ProgramFiles%\WinZip\winzip64.exe"" (echo 1) else (echo 0)""` - Checks for the existence of WinZip executable. The level of operation appears standard but might be associated with script automation rather than user-driven activity.
     - **WinZip Activity**: Another command sequence utilizes WinZip with encryption `-s""hello""` to zip files, which is strongly indicative of encryption-related operations.
   - A notable command: `cmd.exe /c path=%path%;""C:\Program Files (x86)\winzip"" & mkdir .\tmp\victim-files & cd .\tmp\victim-files & echo ""This file will be encrypted"" > .\encrypted_file.txt & ""%ProgramFiles%\WinZip\winzip64.exe"" -min -a -s""hello"" archive.zip * & dir` suggests potential file manipulation with encryption, which is suspicious without a clear, valid purpose.

2. **Process Hierarchy Analysis**:
   - The sequence of events displays typical command-line and process spawning hierarchy (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) often seen in reconnaissance or setup scripts rather than regular user activity.
   
3. **HVAC Level**:
    - These processes are executed with high integrity levels, meaning they have significant privileges on the host system. Operations carried out with such privileges can potentially cause significant changes to the system.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Encryption operations, creating directories named `victim-files`, and the scripts that initiate these activities without clear business justification could indicate preparation for data exfiltration, ransomware activity, or evidence of compromise.

**Guidance and Recommendations**:
- Investigate the function and purpose of the `admin_test` account and any associated scripts or scheduled tasks.
- Review system-wide policies for command-line and scripting tools like WinZip, to ensure their usage complies with organizational policies.
- Conduct broader scans on `Server002` for indicators of further compromise, particularly focusing on detecting unauthorized encryption or data exfiltration.
- Check if similar patterns appear on other machines within the network.

**Final Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The evidence suggests that the observed activities are consistent with indicators of potential malware behavior, particularly involving unauthorized data manipulation and encryption using command-line utilities with high privileges. Further investigation and threat containment measures are advised immediately."
Search files of interest and save them to a single zip file (Windows),"Upon examining the provided log entries, some events suggest activities that align with potentially suspicious behavior, which warrants further investigation:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Successful Logon)**:
   - The log indicates a security event where the `SYSTEM` user successfully logged on with a Logon Type of 5 (Service startup) using services.exe. This is typical for a system process and isn't inherently suspicious on its own.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**:
   - The `SYSTEM` account is being granted a range of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This occurrence by itself is not suspicious given the `SYSTEM` context but provides a high level of access that might be sought after in privilege escalation attacks.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation Attempt)**:
   - Multiple failed attempts to retrieve credentials or tokens for MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop and WindowsLive services. These failed attempts are suspicious as they may represent an unauthorized attempt to access accounts or services.

### Application Log Analysis:
- The logs do not reflect any unusual or suspicious entries related to application errors or warnings outside normal operations.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - The script executed by PowerShell (`search and compress specific file types`), is not typical routine behavior, especially as it involves compressing and storing data, potentially indicating data exfiltration activities.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation Events**:
   - Numerous executions of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by an admin account. Such activity might suggest script or tool usage for log inquiries or modifications that are not typical for legitimate admin tasks without context.
   - The process `wuauclt.exe` executing with command-line arguments for UpdateDeploymentProvider might be benign, part of routine updates but should be cross-referenced with intended update schedules.

### System Log Analysis:
- The logged events for Windows Updates and Kernel Operations align with expected operations and do not necessarily indicate malicious intent.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: There is unusual activity in the PowerShell log that could indicate data manipulation or exfiltration attempts, as well as failed credential validation attempts that may signify attempts at unauthorized access. The combination of PowerShell execution and credential attempts suggests that further investigation into these aspects is prudent.

### Recommendations for Further Steps:
1. **Audit PowerShell Logs**: Look into the context, frequency, and intent of PowerShell scripts execution.
2. **Credential Monitoring**: Check surrounding logs for further evidence of unauthorized logon attempts and compromised credentials.
3. **Process Execution Review**: Validate the context and need behind unusual executions of `wevtutil.exe` and usage of special privileges by processes.
4. **User Activity Review**: Evaluate user behavior tied to `admin_test` for unusual or unauthorized activities.
5. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Investigate network logs for potential data exfiltration following the file zip operation.

Proceed with a detailed investigation into these highlighted areas before concluding malicious intent, considering contextual, physical, and policy data."
Registry artefact when application use microphone,"After analyzing the provided logs, several key points suggest anomalous and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Cmd.exe with Suspicious Command Lines**:
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being invoked with command-line arguments that modify Windows registry keys related to the microphone capability. The command `cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\CapabilityAccessManager\\ConsentStore\\microphone\\NonPackaged\\C:#Windows#Temp#file.exe` suggests an attempt to alter registry entries, which is suspicious.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security logs show instances of time change events (`EventID 4616`). This could be benign or indicative of attempts to manipulate logs or time-dependent security measures, though this alone is not conclusively malicious, additional context from other logs suggests potential tampering.

3. **Regular Use of Legitimate Tools**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `reg.exe`, etc., are observed frequently. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their execution should be reviewed in context, especially if associated with unusual command-line arguments or registry modifications as observed.

4. **No Direct Indicators of Known Malware**:
   - No hashes correlate with known malware signatures in this particular log snapshot.

5. **High Integrity and Consistent User Context**:
   - All suspicious activities appear to be executed under a user context with high integrity levels, which might suggest privilege escalation but could also be normal administrative actions.

**Assessment**:
- **The activities in the logs should be classified as SUSPICIOUS.** The registry modifications targeting microphone settings, time manipulations, and execution context in high integrity suggest potential efforts to either evade detection or establish persistence.

**Guidance**:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into why the microphone settings were altered in the registry and verify if such actions were part of authorized administrative tasks.
- **Audit User Activities**: Check user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any anomalies in logons, privilege escalations, or command executions beyond regular administrative tasks.
- **Endpoint Security Review**: Employ tools to further check the endpoint for known indicators of compromise, such as abnormal network connections or unauthorized software installations.
- **Monitor Systems**: Enhance monitoring on the affected systems to catch any additional suspicious commands or behavior in real-time.

To conclusively determine malicious intent or benign activity, these recommendations should be executed as they will provide the context and validation required."
Recon information for export with Command Prompt,"Based on my analysis of the provided event logs, here are the findings:

1. **Security Log**: The entries in the Security logs are related to the system time change (`EventID: 4616`) executed by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process running under the LOCAL SERVICE account's context. Time changes often are benign system operations, but they can be used by attackers. This action alone is NOT inherently suspicious unless coupled with malicious indicators elsewhere, which are not present here.

2. **Sysmon Log**: 
   - Several processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `sc.exe`, `doskey.exe`, `wmic.exe`, `tree.com`) are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of these processes within a short timeframe suggests automated scripting or administrative tasks. While some of these utilities like `wmic`, `whoami`, and `cmd.exe` can be used in attack chains for enumeration or privilege escalation, they are often benign in admin contexts without rebellious behavior.
   - The `cmd.exe` executed with a complex command line aimed at listing services, DOS key history, process list, and directory structure to temp files could indicate information gathering steps typical in malicious scripts. However, without correlation of unauthorized access, this seems more like a legitimate administrative script or scheduled task.
   - Logs related to Microsoft Edge update operations (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) indicate standard update behaviors without indicators of compromise. Given processes are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, these logs seem benign.
   
3. **System Log**: The time adjustments captured here coincide with the activity in the Security logs and further suggest benign system maintenance or synchronization adjustments.

4. **Application Log**: 
   - The SPP (Software Protection Platform) service logs appear standard and reflect typical operations.
   - `edgeupdate` entries reflect expected behavior of stopping services related to Microsoft Edge updates, without any indication of malicious activities.
   
### Conclusion:
From the detailed review of the logs provided, activities, including process execution and time changes, appear to be part of standard system administration or updates. However, the frequent running of administrative tools in rapid succession does prompt slight attention, primarily involving the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These traits present as typical administrative tasks and not concrete evidence of a breach.

### Final Resolution:
- **Resolution: BENIGN**, with a mention to **monitor `SERVER002\admin_test` user activities** for any anomalies or unauthorized scripts execution, given the number of elevated command utilities used concurrently.
"
Compress Data for Exfiltration With Rar,"Upon reviewing the provided logs across different Windows event channels, the following analysis is provided:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **EventID 4624**: This indicates a successful logon. This particular event is a type 5 logon, which is typically used for service startup. The logon is using the SYSTEM account, which is standard for services and not inherently suspicious.
   - **EventID 4672**: Special privileges were assigned during the logon including SeDebugPrivilege, which can be used for accessing sensitive data and processes. SYSTEM accounts often have these privileges by default, but it's always worth verifying the context in which these privileges are being used.
   - **EventID 4616**: Indicates a time change event by LOCAL SERVICE. Without further context, this could be benign, although it might also indicate tampering if not expected.

2. **Application Log:**
   - **EdgeUpdate and SecurityCenter Events**: Regular service stops/starts and status updates related to Edge and Windows Defender, respectively, which do not indicate malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Cmd.exe Execution**: Various `cmd.exe` processes are executed by `admin_test`. The command to check if `WinRAR` exists in `ProgramFiles` seems routine if related to a scheduled task or script for maintenance. However, another command creates an archive with text files in the user profile, which could indicate unauthorized data collection.
   - **Wevtutil.exe Execution**: Multiple instances are executed by `admin_test` which can be normal if administering logs, but it could also be used to clear or export event logs, which requires further context.
   - **Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe Execution**: These are normal activities typically used to retrieve system information but could also be part of malicious reconnaissance.
   
4. **System Log:**
   - No events directly stand out as malicious. The logs indicate synchronization and potential system time changes, common in regular system operation.

Considering all events, the presence of potential data archiving with `WinRAR` and multiple log file manipulation attempts via `wevtutil.exe` would require further investigation. The execution patterns suggest a need for inquiry into the activities of the `admin_test` user account to confirm intent and legitimacy.

### Assessment and Next Steps:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- **Recommendations**:
  - Perform a deeper investigation into the actions executed by the `admin_test` account to confirm their legitimacy.
  - Review scheduled tasks and scripts to confirm if `WinRAR` usage is part of a legitimate process.
  - Verify if the `wevtutil.exe` executions align with legitimate administrative tasks or point to potential log tampering.
  - Monitor any future changes in SYSTEM time settings for validity and source verification. 

Conclusively, while there's no outright confirmed malicious activity, several actions warrant further scrutiny to rule out the potential for unauthorized use or data exfiltration."
Windows Screencapture,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here are some notable observations and their implications:

1. **Windows Update Logs:**
   - Numerous entries from the `WindowsUpdateClient` suggest regular updates to various Microsoft applications such as Microsoft Edge, VCLibs, .NET Native Runtime, and others. The continuous and rapid updates (often within seconds or minutes of each other) could be typical due to cumulative updates or checks for the latest versions when system maintenance is executed.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Significant activity involving Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and related installers running at system level, suggesting a large batch of update activities.
   - There are also logs showing PowerShell activities with potentially suspicious command-line arguments, like scripting operations bundling `cmd.exe` and other utilities like `psr.exe`, with added DLL imports and command execution. These might indicate scripting or automation attempts, potentially automated system configurations or scheduled tasks.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Logs show specific PowerShell commands executing scripts with mouse event simulations and other GUI operations. This could be suspicious if not part of a known maintenance or automation task.
   - PowerShell execution policy is set to restricted, which is a limiting factor against executing certain scripts, indicating an intent to control execution policy but followed by relatively unrestricted script activities which flag caution.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Several `Logon` entries (Event ID 4624) are noted, primarily with SYSTEM privileges or NT AUTHORITY interactions, common for routine system tasks.
   - Elevated privilege events (Event ID 4672) correspond to admin-level activities which, while expected on a server environment, appear largely linked to system automation processes.
   - There are multiple `Credential Validation` entries (Event ID 5379) showing failed operations concerning system or service accounts - attributed to tasks not finding the appropriate permissions or authentication tokens.

**Analysis Summary:**

The events primarily indicate routine system update processes, which coincidentally detailed automated and security measures in place. Here, the repeated logs concern scheduled update checks and executions, script-based automation for system operations, and credential checks for system service accounts.

Noteworthy is the PowerShell script invoking Windows utilities in a batch-like manner. If this activity is not tied to a legitimate administration task known within your network operations, it would be worth examining further.

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**

The batch scripting execution through PowerShell, involving mouse events and operating with elevated privileges in conjunction with Windows Updates, does look atypical if these aren't scheduled maintenance activities. I suggest confirming these against known administrative tasks of the organization. Further investigation should target the source or scheduled tasks leading to these scripted behaviors. Validate with system owners whether such automated update checks or related operations are aligned with expected system management protocols.

**Recommendation:** 
- Investigate PowerShell script origins and purposes to identify if these align with scheduled tasks or unauthorized changes.
- Correlate with scheduled update activities from system administrators.
- Consider enhancing logging to pinpoint any unauthorized script execution more explicitly in later logs."
Collect Clipboard Data via VBA,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate a suspicious sequence of actions executed by PowerShell on `Server002`. The command involves:
     - Modifying the clipboard content via `Set-Clipboard`.
     - Downloading and executing scripts from a remote URL using `iwr (""Invoke-WebRequest"")` followed by `IEX (""Invoke-Expression"")`.
     - Invoking a script possibly associated with a Microsoft Office product via `Invoke-script -macroFile`.
   - Such usage of PowerShell, especially involving `IEX` (which allows running arbitrary code) and accessing remote scripts, is typically associated with malicious activity. This type of behavior is characteristic of downloading and executing malicious payloads or running PowerShell-based malware.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs reveal multiple instances of PowerShell and co-related processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` run by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe`, used to deal with Windows Event Logs, mixed with PowerShell activities could suggest attempts at log manipulation or clearing, although this cannot be conclusively determined.
   - The sequence and frequency of these process executions especially in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell script loading increase the likelihood of malicious activity.
   
3. **EdgeUpdate Events:**
   - The series of Sysmon events related to Microsoft Edge updates appear benign on their surface. These are regular activities for a system keeping its software up-to-date, indicating background services or scheduled tasks executing updates.
   - However, it is inconclusive from the current data whether any backdoor techniques or DLL sideloading is being utilized without a deeper investigation and comparison against known threat patterns. 

4. **Application Logs & Other Logs:**
   - Application logs indicate typical service messages and stop events tracking Microsoft EdgeUpdates. This alone doesn't indicate maliciousness.
   - The absence of critical system logs or other evidence doesn’t eliminate concerns about the previously discussed PowerShell activity.

**Assessment:**

Given the observed behaviors, particularly the PowerShell activities:
- **Indicators of Compromise:** The use of `Invoke-Expression` with remote scripts, clipboard operations combined with likely macro activities, all point towards a potentially harmful operation. 
- **Risk Level:** High - As it's unlikely that regular system administration requires direct external script execution via PowerShell without proper controls.
- **Potential Threats:** This is suggestive of an ongoing attack or recent compromise, potentially leading to data exfiltration or additional payload execution.

**Resolution:**
- **Status: MALICIOUS** - The PowerShell activities combined with evidence from Sysmon imply executed commands align with known threat behaviors. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Block the IP or domain from which scripts are being fetched and assess the impact.
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Full Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the affected servers and broader network activities.
   - Verify all PowerShell scripts and Sysmon events related to abnormal process creations.

3. **Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Implement group policies to restrict PowerShell script execution.
   - Employ additional alerting for similar PowerShell and Sysmon activities.
   - Review and implement improved security practices for privilege and access management.

By acting on these pressured actions, the firm can mitigate further risks and ensure a sounder security posture moving forward."
Azure - Enumerate Azure Blobs with MicroBurst,"### Detailed Analysis of Event Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **PowerShell Execution**: 
  - A PowerShell script `Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1` was executed using `powershell.exe`, indicating potentially automated Azure Blob enumeration activity. This script was executed from a temporary file path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`.
  - Command executed: `Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs -base secure -permutations ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\permutations.txt"" -outputfile ""$env:temp\dataTest1.txt""`.
  - This type of action, particularly when involving scripts in temporary directories, may indicate intentional scanning or data exfiltration activities. The usage of `Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1` specifically suggests access to or enumeration of Azure storage, which could be a benign administrative task if authorized or a sign of lateral movement or reconnaissance if unauthorized.

#### Security Log:

- **Logon Events**:
  - Event ID `4624`: Logon Type 5 and 3 indicate a service and network logon respectively, with the user `admin_test` and `SYSTEM`. Network logon via NTLM with elevated privileges is noted (`ElevatedToken`).
  - Event ID `4672`: Privileges assigned include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, suggesting high-level system access granted to `admin_test` and `SYSTEM`. This could indicate a routine service action or an attempted privilege escalation.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **Process Creation**:
  - PowerShell and other executables like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wmiprvse.exe` are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - **Edge Update Activity**: Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update setup, executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This likely indicates software updates, though the high frequency of execution is notable.
  - **Other Executions**: Processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` were executed, which might indicate attempting to enumerate information about the system or current user context.

### Identified Concerns and Threat Level:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Running scripts from temporary directories, such as `Invoke-EnumerateAzureBlobs.ps1`, can be indicative of unauthorized reconnaissance activities. It is crucial to verify whether this script execution was part of legitimate administrative tasks.

2. **Privilege and Access Management**:
   - The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and similar high-level privileges awarded to a non-system account (`admin_test`) merits attention. Privilege escalation could be indicative of an attack or misconfiguration.
   
3. **Frequent High-Privilege Service Executions**:
   - Despite Microsoft Edge Update appearing routine, unexpected frequency or timing can sometimes be a cloak for malfeasance, especially given the environmental context.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the logs suggest activities that could be typical administrative tasks if adequately authorized but also exhibit behavioral indicators that might align with reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts. While there's no explicit proof of confirmed malicious actions only signs that generally suggest a need for further scrutiny.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs present activities that warrant additional verification. Specifically, confirm the legitimacy of scripts executed from temporary directories and ensure that the requested high-level privileges align with expected operations and information security policies. Further investigation should include checking for any unauthorized access to Azure environments and reviewing Active Directory permissions related to the `admin_test` account to access integrity.
***Next Steps***:
- Verify the source and authorization for the PowerShell script in question.
- Review access controls and event logs for the `admin_test` account.
- Conduct a security audit on Azure resources to ensure no unauthorized access occurred.
"
Office365 - Email Forwarding,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, here's a detailed analysis highlighting suspicious activities that need further investigation:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 5379:** This event is related to credential validation operations. The return code `3221226021` indicates a failed attempt. These events occurred multiple times within a short window,  indicating repeated failed attempts to access certain credential operations for MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive. Repeated failed access attempts could hint at potential malicious activity, such as a brute force or credential stuffing attempt.

2. **Security Log (Privilege Assignment):**
   - **Event ID 4672:** This indicates special privileges assigned to a new logon, specifically the SYSTEM user with extensive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is frequently abused for malicious activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command aimed at connecting to Exchange Online and creating an inbox rule forwarding to an external email (`file_Operator@fakeemail.aq`) suggests potential exfiltration of email or sensitive information. Using `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force` is a known bad practice indicating poor handling of passwords within scripts and is often seen in malicious PowerShell scripts.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries are related to PowerShell execution (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`), showing the execution of scripts, including commands to create potentially malicious inbox rules.
   - Wevtutil executions, which are command-line utilities for managing Windows Event logs, by `SERVER002\admin_test` user, may indicate log tampering or clearing activities.

**Assessment Summary:**
- The PowerShell activity to forward emails could potentially be malicious, aiming to exfiltrate data.
- The repeated credential validation attempts and the usage of privileges that could facilitate further attacks like privilege escalation or lateral movement is suspicious.
- The use of `wevtutil` might point towards attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, which is a common tactic to cover tracks after malicious actions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account activity, especially any changes to credentials or privilege assignments.
2. Review all inbox rules and email configurations for unauthorized changes.
3. Monitor for any unusual network connections, specifically to domains associated with `fakeemail.aq`.
4. Implement additional logging and alerting for critical events, such as PowerShell execution and credential access, to catch ongoing activities.
5. Consider running a full security audit and forensic investigation to ensure no backdoors or persistent threats remain on the system."
Email Collection with PowerShell Get-Inbox,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell were executed with a command-line argument that included `-executionpolicy bypass -command`, which is suspicious as it attempts to bypass the PowerShell execution policy. This is often used in malicious operations to execute scripts without restrictions.
   - The script being executed is `Get-Inbox.ps1`, located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\src\\Get-Inbox.ps1`). Temporary directories are common places for scripts associated with malicious activity because of their transient nature.

2. **High Frequency of Process Creation:**
   - There is a high frequency of process creation events involving `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. While `conhost.exe` is used for console windows and `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing event logs, the rapid sequence of these processes in conjunction might indicate suspicious activity. Typically, this behavior could suggest attempts to manipulate or clear logs.

3. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - The use of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be typical for recon activities to gather system information by an attacker once they have gained access.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - There are multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components, which appears to be legitimate update activity. The session IDs and the paths involved seem to correspond with legitimate update tasks, although it's a high volume for such a short period.

5. **User Account:**
   - The user involved in most of these activities is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating these actions were performed under an account with admin rights, which may increase the risk level if compromised.

### Assessment:
The activity logs show:
- Indicators of possibly malicious activity given the PowerShell execution policy bypass and the use of scripts from temporary directories.
- Unusual system behavior with rapid and frequent process creations, potentially indicating obfuscation or other nefarious activities.
- Legitimate update actions that inherently involve elevated privileges but occur alongside potentially suspicious activities.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Based on the events analyzed, the logs contain suspicious activities, particularly around the PowerShell execution with bypassed security policies and the high frequency of process activities. Further investigation is recommended to confirm whether these actions were authorized and to ensure no compromise has occurred.

### Guidance:
1. **Conduct a Review of the PowerShell Activities:**
   - Verify if the `Get-Inbox.ps1` script is authorized and determine what actions it performs.
   - Check system policies and audit settings to ensure execution policies are enforced.

2. **Investigate `admin_test` Account Usage:**
   - Verify who had access to the `admin_test` account at the time these activities took place.
   - Assess whether the use of this account was in line with expected behavior.

3. **Monitoring Enhancements:**
   - Increase monitoring of similar PowerShell activities and unusual process activity.
   - Implement stricter logging and alerting around changes to key process and file executions.

4. **Security Audit:**
   - Consider a full audit of the security settings and logs to ensure there are no other overlooked signs of compromise across the system."
Windows Screen Capture (CopyFromScreen),"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, here are my findings:

### PowerShell Logs
- Logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that captures the entire screen and saves it as a PNG file in the Temp directory. The command used involves:
  ```powershell
  $screen = [Windows.Forms.SystemInformation]::VirtualScreen
  $bitmap = New-Object Drawing.Bitmap $screen.Width, $screen.Height
  $graphic = [Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($bitmap)
  $graphic.CopyFromScreen($screen.Left, $screen.Top, 0, 0, $bitmap.Size)
  $bitmap.Save(""$env:TEMP\\data.png"")
  ```
- This activity is highly suspicious as capturing the screen and saving it is often associated with malicious activity like data exfiltration, especially since it appears to run with admin privileges under the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

### Security Logs
- Events logged by `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` do not show suspicious logins or elevation of privileges but capture changes in system time, which may not necessarily relate to malicious activity but should be examined further against any timeline anomalies or if correlated with the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Application Logs
- The presence of SPP and EdgeUpdate service logs appears routine, showing a service stop and some scheduled automatic updates for Edge, consistent with typical software update processes. 

### Sysmon Logs
- Several process creation events show execution of system utilities (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may be benign as these tools are often used for information gathering or troubleshooting.
- Critical to note are the repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility capable of interacting with Windows event logs, file manipulation, or configuration changes, which could denote script or adversarial behavior if executed in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### System Logs
- The records indicate slight adjustments in system time linked to `svchost.exe`, which could be benign or routine synchronization activities. However, it should still be reviewed to ensure no signs of potential tampering, especially following the PowerShell activity.

### Assessment and Resolution
Given the nature of the PowerShell scripts designed to take screenshots secretly, alongside their execution under an admin user account, there is substantial risk associated with these events.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate `Server002` to prevent any further possible data exfiltration.
2. **Review User Accounts**: Investigate the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or activities.
3. **Conduct Root Cause Analysis**: Examine how the malicious script was executed, looking at potential attack vectors such as phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or unauthorized access.
4. **Mitigation and Recovery**: Evaluate the need for password changes, potential patching of vulnerabilities, and strengthen security measures, including monitoring and alerting mechanisms for similar activities.
5. **Report and Document**: Report this incident to the necessary authorities and document all findings and actions for compliance and future prevention.

The logs clearly exhibit signs of activity that aligns with data capture and exfiltration, warranting this assessment and a proactive incident response."
Automated Collection PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations were made to identify any indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed with the command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\data_powershell_collection -ItemType Directory -Force | Out-Null, Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.doc | %% {Copy-Item $_.FullName -destination $env:TEMP\data_powershell_collection}}
     ```
   - This command creates a directory in the temporary path and recursively searches for `.doc` files to copy them to the new directory.
   - The use of PowerShell for file system operations, especially copying specific file types, is considered suspicious as it could be indicative of data exfiltration or enumeration attempts.

2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While these tools are legitimate, frequent use together, especially by an admin account, could suggest an attempt to gather system information and user context.
   - `whoami.exe` is executed twice within a short timeframe, suggesting a potential enumeration of user permissions or accounts.
   - `svchost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` involvement in high-frequency execution can be normal in many system operations, but could also support other exploits if leveraged specifically.

3. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Regular updates by the Microsoft Edge Update service (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are legitimate activities, but in bulk or in rapid succession, these may disguise or lead into grounds for exploitation if accompanied by other anomalies.
   - Additionally, the presence of numerous `nt authority\system` level executions by EdgeUpdate can be seen across several processes, which requires scrutiny, but is generally expected for service updates.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Time adjustments (`Event ID 4616`) are often logged and generally expected for legitimate time sync activities across networked systems, yet must be examined for suspect non-admin time change attempts. Here, observable syncs by `svchost.exe` with `ntp` are considered standard operational behavior.

### Assessment:
Based on the above analysis and in the absence of any red flags such as known malicious hashes, misplaced processes, unusual IP connectivity, privilege escalations, or repeated suspcious failed logins, the observed activities are leaning towards **suspicious** due to:

- The unconventional PowerShell command designed to potentially extract `.doc` data.
- The administrator-level execution pattern of information-gathering tools like `whoami.exe`.
  
These activities do not conclusively indicate a full-scale compromise but do warrant a deeper dive to rule out intent of data exfiltration or system profiling.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Recommend further investigation.
  - Evaluate user context and intent, especially around the PowerShell command.
  - Examine network activity and retention logs for external connections or transfers during this window.
  - Conduct a review with security endpoint solutions for potential alerts correlating to these events.
  - Inform IT operations to validate legitimate admin tasks or any applied system updates that match these behaviors.

**Next Steps:** Confirm with system owners and audit any file changes or command executions during this incident timestamp to contextualize whether administrative tasks were pre-planned or align with organizational operations."
Stage data from Discovery.bat,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, certain entries stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell log entries indicating the execution of a PowerShell command using `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from a GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/Discovery.bat`. This action is suspicious, as downloading and executing scripts from an external source is a common technique used by attackers for malicious purposes such as reconnaissance or further exploitation.
   - The downloaded file is being saved to the `$env:TEMP` directory, which can indicate attempts to run scripts without the user's knowledge or authorization.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, with operations that are typical for software updates. However, when correlated with the suspicious PowerShell activity, this could be utilized by an attacker as a legitimate-looking cover for unauthorized persistence mechanisms.
   - An unusual occurrence is the presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activity in a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUB358.tmp\\`), which is atypical for standard software installations and updates and might suggest unauthorized use of the update process for malicious installation.

3. **Security Log:**
   - An event indicating a logon session (Event ID: 4624) for the user `admin_test` with privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be misused for privilege escalation by an attacker.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that `admin_test` has been granted a set of high privileges, which if misused, could lead to unauthorized access or actions.

**Assessment:**
Combining the entries from the PowerShell and Sysmon logs suggests potential abuse of PowerShell for malicious purposes. The downloading of a script from an external URL, especially a `.bat` file, raises significant concerns about potential malicious actions being initiated on the system. The pattern of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update being initiated from a temporary directory could indicate a misuse of legitimate update processes to achieve persistence or stealth.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Action:** Investigate the PowerShell script downloaded from the specified URL to understand its intent and contents.
- **Containment:** Implement access restrictions on the affected host, and disable any unnecessary PowerShell executions, especially those using external URLs.
- **Further Monitoring:** Review network traffic from the host for any additional suspicious patterns or communication with known malicious servers.
- **Incident Response:** Involve the incident response team to conduct a thorough investigation of host activities around the time of these events, particularly focusing on privilege use and logon events for `admin_test`.
- **Security Enhancement:** Review and strengthen user privilege management on the host to prevent misuse of administrative privileges, and restrict PowerShell usage to administrators who are aware of potential risks.

Given the indicators observed, there is a legitimate concern that this activity could be part of a broader attack pattern, warranting immediate investigation to prevent compromise."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with winrar,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and analyses can be formulated:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: There are numerous events related to the Microsoft Edge Update process. These events include the execution of various updater components (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, etc.) and installers. These processes are executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is typical for system-level software updates managed by Microsoft. The command-line arguments and activities seem consistent with legitimate updates, showing no immediate signs of tampering or anomaly.

2. **Command Execution Observations**:
   - There are instances of `cmd.exe` being executed with particular commands, such as checking for the presence of `WinRAR` and setting environment-specific commands. Notably, one instance executed a complex command sequence involving directory creation, file operation (`echo` and file creation), and potential WinRAR usage: `""cmd.exe"" /c mkdir .\tmp\victim-files & cd .\tmp\victim-files & echo ""This file will be encrypted"" > .\encrypted_file.txt & ""%programfiles%/WinRAR/Rar.exe"" a -hp""blue"" hello.rar & dir`.
   - This command sequence is somewhat suspicious due to the mention of encryption, potentially implicating ransomware-like behavior or file archiving with password protection. The usage context and purpose need further investigation.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: The `wevtutil.exe` process is seen multiple times, which is a utility for managing Windows Event logs. This could be benign activity; however, if this tool is used excessively or manipulated, it can be suspicious as it indicates potential log clearing or modification behavior to hide malicious activities.

4. **Elevated Privileges**: The security logs indicate a logon session with elevated privileges (`EventID 4672`), providing the user with several sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. While common in system updates or legitimate admin tasks, if associated with non-standard activities, it could indicate privilege abuse.

5. **Creation of Temporary Processes**: Instances of `conhost.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe` are shown in use. While these are typical processes, context is essential as these could be leveraged during remote management through PowerShell or malicious use.

**Assessment**:
- The inclusion of numerous system updates and process executions by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are, on the surface, consistent with typical system maintenance and Windows updates, especially revolving around updates to Microsoft Edge.
- The suspicious command execution by `cmd.exe` suggesting manual file manipulation and encryption processes requires deeper investigation to rule out malicious intent potentially linked to unauthorized data processing or ransomware.
- Activities surrounding `wevtutil.exe` and elevation of privileges should be reviewed in context to ensure these aren't a deviation from expected behavior.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The logs predominantly reflect benign update operations; however, the command involving encryption-like behavior, alongside elevated access, merits additional scrutiny. It would be prudent to conduct a focused investigation into specific user actions and the integrity of files and processes to confirm if there is any actual compromise or misconfiguration leading to unintentional but suspicious behavior."
using device audio capture commandlet,"To properly evaluate these logs, we should consider several aspects of system, application, PowerShell, and security logs for potential signs of malicious activity:

### System Logs
- **Time Synchronization (EventID 24, 1):** Multiple events show the system time being adjusted slightly forward. This could be a standard activity if the system time was off and is being correctly adjusted by `svchost.exe`, a normal system process.
- **Time Service Activity (EventID 35):** Indicates the system synchronizing time with a legitimate NTP server `time.windows.com`.

### Application Logs
- **Software Protection Platform (EventID 16384):** Indicates normal software protection services, not abnormal but ensure this is not tampered with later.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Execution:**
  - Execution of `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These are standard Windows processes, likely part of administrative or diagnostic activities.
  - **PowerShell Execution**: Detected several PowerShell instances (`powershell.exe`) with a command referring to `WindowsAudioDevice-Powershell-Cmdlet`. This seems odd if not a known, scheduled task on the system, given PowerShell’s powerful nature and frequent use in attacks.
  
### PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Usage:** Multiple occurrences of PowerShell being invoked for a task related to ""WindowsAudioDevice-Powershell-Cmdlet."" This could be benign if part of an administrative script or scheduled task, but could be suspicious due to PowerShell's frequent use by attackers for script execution.

### Security Logs
- **Time Change Audit (EventID 4616):** Just an audit record of the time change mentioned earlier; no clear indication of abuse or compromise from these alone.

### Analysis
- **PowerShell Activity:** While not immediately indicative of compromise, unusual or unknown script invocations, especially involving PowerShell, warrant further investigation. The `WindowsAudioDevice-Powershell-Cmdlet` task should be verified as legitimate and necessary.
- **Time Synchronizations and Adjustments:** These adjustments seem standard and match typical behavior with system time corrections.
- **Generic Windows Processes:** There appears to be nothing overtly malicious about the process executions logged, involving standard utilities.

### Conclusion
Given the logs, it seems this system may be involved in legitimate administrative tasks; however, the PowerShell command specifically should be investigated to ensure it’s a legitimate task and part of expected administrative scripts.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis above, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is required to confirm the legitimacy of the PowerShell scripts executed on this host. It is recommended that the origin of these scripts is verified, and if possible, to ensure they have not been tampered with or are not being used for malicious purposes."
Windows Recall Feature Enabled - DisableAIDataAnalysis Value Deleted,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed assessment:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Commands Executed:**  
  The PowerShell logs show that a script was run which adds and then deletes a registry entry `DisableAIDataAnalysis` under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI`.
- **Suspicious Activity:**  
  The fact that a registry key is created and immediately deleted within a short time span could be suspicious as it mimics tactics used by malicious actors to evade detection by cleaning up traces after execution.

### Application Log:
- **Edge Update Events:**  
  Logs show the stopping of `edgeupdate` services, which are routine for updates and maintenance.

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616:**  
  This pertains to system time changing events. They could potentially indicate tampering if seen in certain contexts but the logs show these changes happening within minimal timeframes, likely reflecting standard synchronization activities involving the Windows Time Service (`svchost.exe`).

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Execution Patterns:**  
  Multiple executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. The presence of these processes themselves isn't inherently suspicious, but they act as supporting evidence that administrative or script-based tasks were being executed repeatedly in a short time frame.
- **PowerShell Execution:**  
  Specifically, the execution of `powershell.exe` with registry manipulation confirms the previous finding from the PowerShell logs.
- **Edge Update Processes:**  
  Normal execution for EdgeUpdate as part of maintaining Microsoft Edge browser updates.

### System Log:
- **Kernel and Time Service Events:**  
  These reflect system background tasks and time synchronization actions that appear standard.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Indicators:**  
    - The repeated registry entry manipulation via PowerShell looks like potentially unwanted behavior, demonstrating a pattern that warrants further investigation as it may indicate an attempt to modify system configurations temporarily without retention of change.
    - There is no explicit evidence that shows clear malicious intent alone; instead, the activity is unusual and could be indicative of testing, misconfigurations, or potential unauthorized configuration attempts.

### Final Resolution: 
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity in the logs contains patterns that are not outright malicious but deviate from standard behavior, especially surrounding registry manipulation. This suggests an investigation may be needed to clarify intent and establish any risks connected with these actions.

### Guidance:
- **Next Steps:**  
  - Review and verify the use of the script creating and removing registry keys to understand its intent. Verify the legitimacy of any scheduled tasks or scripts executed by the `admin_test` user.
  - Conduct a thorough security audit to see if there are any other anomalies in user behavior or permissions changes.
  - Consider the context of the environment and what changes were anticipated or routine during this timeframe (e.g., system updates, maintenance scripts)."
Zip a Folder with PowerShell for Staging in Temp,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**1. Windows PowerShell Log:**

The PowerShell log entries indicate a sequence of operations initiated by `powershell.exe`. The specific command involves compressing a folder located in a temporary directory into a zip file:

- **Observation**: The command executed is: 
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {Compress-Archive -Path ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\bin\Folder_to_zip"" -DestinationPath $env:TEMP\Folder_to_zip.zip -Force}
  ```

- **Assessment**: While compression using PowerShell is a legitimate function, its usage involving temporary directories can be suspicious, especially if the source directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\bin\`) is not a standard location for compressed files in daily operations.

**2. Sysmon Log:**

The logs showcase a series of events where multiple system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

- **Observation**:
  - `wevtutil.exe` is used for event logging management.
  - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process managing console windows.
  - `hostname.exe` is checking the computer name.
  - `whoami.exe` determines the current logged-in user's identity.

- **Assessment**: The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` could imply reconnaissance activity. However, no overtly malicious actions are apparent in the logs provided.

**3. System Log:**

There is an event indicating a time change:

- **Observation**: 
  - The system time was adjusted from `2024-10-23 16:09:00` back to `2024-10-23 16:08:58`. 
  - This could result from a legitimate time synchronization adjustment process via `svchost.exe`.

- **Assessment**: While time adjustments can be harmless, any unexplained system clock changes, especially moving times backward, warrant closer inspection for potential tampering.

**4. Security Log:**

The security log records events related to time changes:

- **Observation**: The security events corroborate the time changes captured in the system logs, detailing the process (`svchost.exe`) responsible for this change.
  
- **Assessment**: As previously mentioned, consistent documentation of time changes could indicate routine time service corrections, but should still be evaluated in the context of other system behaviors for assurance.

### Overall Assessment

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- While no definitive malicious activity is identified, the use of PowerShell to compress and handle files under temporary directories, the frequent checking of system details (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`), coupled with time adjustments, raises suspicion. This combination of actions could suggest reconnaissance or preparatory stages of a more complex attack.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Investigate the source and intended use of the compressed file. Validate if this aligns with any known legitimate requirements or workflows.
   - Check if the context around `SERVER002\admin_test` user aligns with expected administrative tasks.
   - Review recent logins and access patterns for anomalies.
  
2. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on `Server002`, focusing on actions executed by `admin_test`.
   - Alert on further non-standard use of PowerShell, particularly script activity from temporary directories.

3. **Review System Changes**:
   - Review recent system configurations and any other time-change records for anomalies.
   - Validate time service configurations to ensure integrity.

This assessment should help determine a more conclusive next step if further suspicious activity is not identified or if outright malicious intentions become evident."
Registry artefact when application use webcam,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we can derive the following insights:

1. **Application Log:**
   - No significant suspicious activity is reported in the application logs. The logs indicate routine updates and service processes like `edgeupdate`.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Frequent Use of System Utilities:** Multiple system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` are observed being executed in close succession. The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might suggest a user is checking system information, which is not inherently suspicious. However, the fact that `cmd.exe` is being used with registry modification commands (`reg add`) raises flags as it can be indicative of persistence or privilege escalation attempts.
   - **Registry Modification by cmd.exe:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments focusing on modifying registry keys related to `CapabilityAccessManager` for webcam usage timestamps is particularly suspicious. This might suggest an attempt to tamper with application access settings or mislead monitoring about application usage patterns.
   - **Execution Context:** The processes are executed under high integrity level and the `admin_test` user context, which can indicate elevated permissions.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** The activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated processes appear to be typical update processes and don't show signs of malicious activity. Nonetheless, given the frequency and rapid succession of these processes, it might warrant verification of their versions post-update to ensure integrity.

3. **Indicators of Potential Threats:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to modify registry keys in a short timespan can be a red flag for potential privilege escalation or system customization attempts outside of regular operation.
   - Even though `whoami` and `hostname` can be used for benign purposes, in the context of the simultaneous registry modification, continuous observation is required.

4. **Time Synchronization:**
   - An event log related to Windows Time Service suggests regular time synchronization activity. There is no suspicious activity detected in this part of the logs.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the observations, using standard system tools in conjunction with registry modifications, especially concerning sensitive areas like webcam permissions, presents a risk that warrants further scrutiny.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - While there is no definitive evidence of a breach, the behavior suggests deeper investigation is needed to rule out malicious intent.
  - Recommended actions include verifying the integrity of registry keys related to webcam access, conducting a comprehensive review of recent changes by `admin_test`, and monitoring for recurring execution patterns that match this behavior.

In summary, while most activities in the logs appear benign, the cumulative pattern around registry modification suggests a persistent investigation to ensure proper system operation and security."
Azure - Scan for Anonymous Access to Azure Storage (Powershell),"The analyzed logs from the Security, System, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Application logs for Server002 show two main activities of interest:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616 in Security Log & Event ID 1 in System Log)**:
   - These events showcase the synchronization of the system's time. The changes in system time are managed by `svchost.exe`, which appears to be syncing to a legitimate time service (`time.windows.com`).
   - The presence of these events alone typically does not signify malicious activity unless accompanied by additional suspicious actions.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed which attempted to invoke a web request to a URL commonly used for accessing cloud storage (`https://dataTest2.blob.core.windows.net//`) and handle exceptions.
   - The script captures the response, or lack thereof, and stores this information in a temporary text file located in the environment's temp directory.
   - Given the nature of this action, it is important to determine whether this access attempt is consistent with expected software behavior or user activity. Unauthorized access attempts could signify data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities.

3. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`**:
   - Several instances of these executables being run in quick succession, particularly `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`, can be indicative of log clearing or reconnaissance actions, potentially aimed at gathering user information or clearing event logs to hide tracks.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - The logs also contain events showing the routine operation of Microsoft Edge Update processes. These processes executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, which is expected behavior for automatic system updates.

**Assessment and Recommendations**:
- The PowerShell log entry involving a web request should be reviewed further to determine its legitimacy and context. This type of behavior aligns with potential reconnaissance or data exfiltration tactics.
- The repeated execution of specific system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) should be investigated further, as these are sometimes used in malicious activity chains.
- From a surface-level inspection without additional context, the EdgeUpdate activity appears normal, though it's always prudent to ensure systems are updated only through legitimate channels.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
- The logs contain activities that suggest further investigation is needed, especially concerning the PowerShell activity and the execution of certain utilities, to confirm whether they are part of a legitimate administrative task or a potential compromise. The frequency and pattern may warrant deeper investigation, including reviewing the origin of these actions and their correlation with user activities or expected software behaviors."
Automated Collection Command Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made:

1. **Application Log Observations:**
   - Multiple entries show ""edgeupdate"" service stopped. This could be related to Microsoft Edge updates, which are common in enterprise environments. 
   - Software Protection Platform Services events are recorded, which generally indicates license validation; no unusual behavior noted in these entries.

2. **Security Log Observations:**
   - Numerous Event ID 4624 logs (successful logon) performed with Logon Type 5, which indicates a service start. The service account used is ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM,"" which is expected for system-level tasks.
   - Event ID 4672 logs show a service account with numerous privileges, but this is typical for SYSTEM logins.
   - A notable amount of Event ID 5379 logs indicate unsuccessful credential validations, specifically related to a MicrosoftAccount user context. The repeated failure could suggest a misconfiguration or a problem with MS account connectivity.
   - Event ID 4798 implies enumeration activity on user accounts like ""Administrator,"" ""Guest,"" and a custom account ""admin_test,"" which might be an integrity check.

3. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - Regular occurrences of Microsoft Edge Update processes with varying command line arguments, which seem typical behavior during an update cycle.
   - Multiple instances of commands and tools such as ""wevtutil,"" ""conhost,"" ""whoami,"" ""rundll32"" and system utilities being executed, mainly by ""SERVER002\admin_test"" and ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.""
   - Suspicious command with ""cmd.exe"" aimed at collecting and copying "".docx"" files from across the file system to a temporary directory. This action is unusual, potentially indicating data gathering for exfiltration.
   - Several processes related to system maintenance and utility tasks are logged (e.g., DeviceCensus, MusNotification).

**Assessment:**
- The bulk of the logged activities appear routine within the scope of system maintenance, updates, error reporting, telemetry, and platform service operations. However, the command executed through ""cmd.exe"" to gather and move .docx files is a red flag, as it suggests potentially unauthorized data collection.
- Continuous failure of Microsoft account authentication might need correcting to ensure account lockouts or similar security issues do not arise.

**Threat or Risk:**
- Potential for data exfiltration through the script attempted with ""cmd.exe"" constitutes a risk. Even though this could be a benign script run unintentionally or for administrative purposes, its activity profile aligns with common reconnaissance and data preparation tactics seen in malicious actions.

**Guidance:**
- Further investigate the logon events and unsuccessful Microsoft Account credential access (Event ID 5379) with the relevant stakeholders to ensure they aren't indicative of attempted unauthorized access.
- The source of the cmd.exe script (copying .docx files) needs identification. Consider verifying its intent and validity with the user/admin responsible for the ""SERVER002\admin_test"" account.
- Conduct a full security audit on the Server002 system and possibly network activity around the times these actions were logged to check correlating suspicious behaviors or anomalies.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The event involving the cmd.exe manipulation of .docx files necessitates further inspection to verify its legitimacy, along with understanding Microsoft Account failures."
