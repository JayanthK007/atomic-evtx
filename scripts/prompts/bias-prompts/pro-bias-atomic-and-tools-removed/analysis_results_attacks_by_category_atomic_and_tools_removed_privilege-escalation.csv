Thread Execution Hijacking,"## Detailed Analysis of Event Logs

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs from PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, Security, and System categories, we can identify the following patterns and potential concerns:

### PowerShell Logs Analysis:
- **Execution of Suspicious Commands**: The PowerShell logs show a script executed via `powershell.exe` involving:
  - `Start-Process notepad -passthru`: This command initiates Notepad and pass its process object.
  - `Start-Process ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\InjectContext.exe""`: This suggests an attempt to execute a potentially suspicious executable named `InjectContext.exe` from a temporary directory. The use of a temp directory and an odd executable name is suspicious.
  - The PowerShell command promptly terminates Notepad after a 5-second sleep, which is not typical behavior for a benign script.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
- **Multiple Process Executions**: The Sysmon logs highlight several processes' activities:
  - Execution of `powershell.exe` with commands mirroring those found in the PowerShell logs.
  - Creation and use of processes like `notepad.exe`, `InjectContext.exe`, and others without clear or typical user instructions.
  - The presence of `InjectContext.exe` suggests possible code injection or similar unwanted behaviors.
  - Several invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are possibly linked to this activity without standard administrative context.
  
### Security Logs Analysis:
- **Privilege Usage**: The Security logs indicate the use of elevated privileges by the user `admin_test`. Notable privileges used include:
  - `SeDebugPrivilege`: Typically used for debugging programs, potentially malicious if misused.
  - `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`: Privileges often exploited during lateral movement or privilege escalation activities on the system.
- **Logon Events**: The logs show multiple NTLM logons happening rapidly around the suspicious timestamps. The presence of NTLM and elevated tokens could indicate malicious use or attempts to impersonate user sessions.

### Application and System Logs Analysis:
- The Application logs primarily report a standard `Software Protection Platform` service event, with nothing suspicious beyond the context of usual operational logging.
- No anomalies or significant insights were recorded in the System logs.

## Assessment, Threats, and Risks
The presented activity fits indicators of potentially malicious conduct:
- Execution from temporary directories and using charteristically dubious executables like `InjectContext.exe`.
- Attempts to manage processes like Notepad for evasion or persistence.
- The combination of user access with powerful privileges and no corroborating user reports or documented administrative tasks.

Further investigation should consider:
- Examining the integrity and origin of the `InjectContext.exe`.
- Security team intervention to immediately quarantine affected systems and analyze the executable.
- Evaluating all machines accessed and controlled by user `admin_test`.
- Reviewing network traffic logs to identify lateral movement or external command-and-control communication.

## Recommendation
Based on the evidence of the unauthorized execution of dubious executables and privilege usage, the activity deviates significantly from legitimate operations and suggests intent to perform unauthorized actions with elevated privileges. Given the convergence of suspicious processes and behaviors:

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

Immediate steps include isolating the machine, potentially resetting access keys, updating security policies, and undertaking a full vulnerability assessment of connected systems."
Dirty Vanity process Injection,"Based on the provided logs for investigation, let's break down the analysis to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious activity.

### Application Log:
- The entry from the ""Software Protection Platform Service"" with EventID 16384 is routine, showing a time event from 2024-10-22, and seems benign without additional context or anomalies.

### System Log:
- The ""Kernel-General"" logs show timezone and time adjustments closely prior and following the adjustment which is typical behavior when dealing with time synchronization. No direct suspicious activity here.
- The ""Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service"" event details synchronization with an NTP server, indicating normal network time sync operations.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell logs indicate execution of PowerShell commands associated with `Start-Process`, which points to both the execution of `redVanity.exe` from a temporary path and `calc.exe`. This is definitely suspicious:
  - PowerShell script execution from a temp directory indicating possible script-based attack.
  - The use of PowerShell to start processes like `calc.exe` alongside another executable (`redVanity.exe`) suggests potential obfuscation tactics.

### Sysmon Log:
- Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` appearing in logs can often be legitimate, but when combined with other factors, they warrant further investigation.
- The Sysmon logs show execution of `redVanity.exe` from a suspicious path, supported by PowerShell starting these processes, suggesting illegitimate execution.
- Execution of `conhost.exe` multiple times by `admin_test` is not directly indicative of malfeasance but aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity.
- `whoami.exe` and `calc.exe` are being executed under the user `admin_test`. Running utility commands like `whoami.exe` can be typical for privilege checking during an attack.
  
### Security Log:
- The security logs reflect normal behavior of successful logon (Event ID 4624), special privileges granted (Event ID 4672), and session logoff (Event ID 4634). However, `admin_test` using special privileges combined with suspicious processing is potentially noteworthy.

### Assessment:
There are clear indications of potentially malicious activity due to:
1. PowerShell execution of a possibly malicious file `redVanity.exe` from a temporary directory.
2. Command chaining indicating the potential execution of unauthorized software.
3. The presence of multiple system utilities (`wevtutil`, `whoami`) and standard applications (`calc.exe`) executed atypically.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities displayed in the logs, primarily concerning the use of PowerShell to execute suspicious binary files from temporary directories, indicate activity that should not be typical on a CEO's machine and warrants further investigation and containment actions.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Initiate a full security scan using EDR solutions focusing on PowerShell activity and file integrity checks.

2. **Investigative Actions**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `redVanity.exe` and related temp directory contents to understand its purpose and origin.
   - Review user `admin_test` activities and audit logs for anomalies over a wider timeframe.
   - Use network logs and historical data to identify any associated network activity or data exfiltration.

3. **Remedial Actions**:
   - Patch vulnerabilities and update security policies related to script execution and PowerShell usage.
   - Educate users on recognizing suspicious activity and secure practice in regards to execution of unverified scripts. 

Given the evidence, further actions are necessary to determine if compromise actually occurred and the extent of it before escalation to a confirmed malicious status."
Process injection ListPlanting,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious Behavior Identified

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The logs indicate several executions of PowerShell, specifically invoking `powershell.exe` with the command to start a process from a temporary directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.015\bin\ListPlanting.exe`. 
   - Additional PowerShell commands are issued to perform other actions (`Start-Sleep`, `Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force`). 
   - The execution of scripts from the temporary directory and the nature of the commands point towards potentially malicious intent as legitimate software generally should not operate from temporary paths with such actions.

2. **Unusual Privileges and User Activity**: 
   - Security logs show that the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is granted several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) which are often exploited for privilege escalation routines.
   - There are multiple login sessions and events associated with elevated privileges which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or utilize administrative powers for unauthorized actions.

3. **Process Creation Events**: 
   - Sysmon records indicate the spawning of various processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell.
   - Frequent use of processes like `WEVTUTIL.EXE`, which is used to manage event logs, can be suspicious when done in conjunction with other indicators of compromise.

4. **Elevated Integrity Processes**: 
   - Several processes show execution with High or System level integrity which, while not inherently suspicious, paired with the other evidence necessitates further scrutiny.

5. **Network Service Executions**:
   - Upon reviewing `sppsvc.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe`, these entries relate to legitimate Windows processes but must be reviewed in context with concurrent suspicious activities.

#### Malicious Activity Indicators

- **Unknown Executable Execution**: The process `ListPlanting.exe`, executed from a temporary directory, is not recognized as a standard Windows or third-party application commonly used by legitimate software processes. Executing unknown binaries from temporary directories can signal malicious activities such as malware distribution, C2 (Command and Control) communication setups, or data exfiltration attempts.
- **PowerShell Commands**: The specific usage of PowerShell indicates potential use for automation of actions, commonly seen in complex attacks or multi-stage malware infections.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the logs provided:
- The use of PowerShell to run potentially malicious executables from temporary directories, in conjunction with the escalated privileges and pattern of process executions, strongly indicates malicious activity.
- The processes (`ListPlanting.exe`) executed are unknown and are potentially harmful as they do not align with known software behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any possible spread of malicious activity.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the isolated machine to identify the source and full scope of the compromise.
3. **Containment**: Remove any identified malware or exploit scripts, and close any backdoors or vulnerabilities.
4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure that all systems are fully patched and anti-malware tools are updated and have conducted a full scan across the network.
5. **User Training and Awareness**: Reinforce security training emphasizing the risks associated with executing unknown software and monitoring for privilege escalations.
6. **Monitoring and Hardening**: Heighten monitoring of logs for similar activities and apply necessary hardenings and policy updates to reduce future risks, such as restricting script execution policies to signed scripts only.

This comprehensive approach will help mitigate the current threat and enhance the security posture moving forward."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process,"In examining the provided log entries, several points stand out across different logs, despite their scattered nature. Below are the detailed observations with respect to potential suspicious activities:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
1. **Execution Commands:**
   - Observations show that PowerShell was executed with commands that are somewhat obscured or potentially scripted to perform specific tasks:
     - **Command**: `{Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -ParentId $PID -TestGuid 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789123}`
     - Another command involving examining `.inf` files: `Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf')`
   - The use of `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` stands out because it's uncommon for legitimate PowerShell scripts to forcibly specify an execution policy, which usually aims to prevent unauthorized scripts.

2. **Commands and Execution Policies:**
   - The execution of PowerShell commands with the restricted policy further points to attempts to ensure scripts do not get blocked – potentially indicative of evasion tactics.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Unusual Process Activity:**
   - Several processes such as `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, and others show activities under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" indicating high privilege usage.
   - Frequent launching of `compatTelRunner.exe` under various command lines and Parent Process GUIDs is slightly anomalous given its telemetry purposes should be infrequent unless manipulated for data exfiltration or other backdoor operations.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` have been invoked several times in quick succession. This activity often points towards potential event log manipulations.

### Security Logs
1. **Credential Management Failures:**
   - Event IDs corresponding to failure in handling or accessing credentials (Event ID: 5379) repeated multiple times with a specific return code.
   - Such failures might indicate unauthorized attempts to access or enumerate credentials by malicious entities.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege` which denote potential system control – relevant in attacks or pivot scenarios.

### Assessment
Taking into consideration the execution of PowerShell scripts with restricted execution policy, repeated failed credential accesses, frequent invocation of typically innocuous system processes with elevated privileges, and potential attempt to manipulate logs, there is reasonable cause to suspect malicious activity.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**
Given the observations:
- While there is evidence of abnormal and potentially malicious behavior, there needs to be further investigation to confirm if these actions are indeed malicious or if they were triggered by legitimate administrative scripts or updates.
- Suggest further analysis including network traffic review, deeper credential/request analysis on authentications, and checking for any newly installed suspicious software or backdoors.

### Guidance for Proceeding
- Isolate the concerned workstation for a detailed forensic investigation to ensure no ongoing compromise.
- Correlation with network logs and endpoint security agents for traffic patterns during the timeframe referenced.
- Notify the incident response team to create a containment and remediation strategy pending further validation of events."
Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

After reviewing the Windows event logs provided, I have identified several key behaviors and activities:

### Key Observations:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activities:**
   - Processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are frequently run under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These executables are typical system utilities commonly found in Windows environments. However, they might be used in different chains to enumerate system information during a broader suspiciousness.
   
2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Notably, a PowerShell command was executed with `pnputil.exe` aimed at installing a driver (`C:\Windows\INF\acpipmi.inf`). While installing drivers is a typical administrative task, execution via PowerShell in this context requires further scrutiny, especially around potentially unauthorized use or elevation of privileges.

3. **Security Events and Privilege Use:**
   - There is evidence of logon activity for the user `admin_test` via NTLM, along with an event (`4672`) indicating a granted set of special privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). This would need further investigation to ensure these privileges were legitimately assigned and used.
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous executions and service calls are related to the Microsoft Edge update processes. These seem usual given they are running from standard installation paths and typical for legitimate software update procedures.
   
5. **Windows Event Viewer Utility (`wevtutil.exe`):**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` was noted. This utility is used to query, export, and backup event logs, and its invocation might indicate an attempt to manipulate or delete logs to cover tracks.

6. **Application Logs:**
   - A log indicates the stopping of a service related to Edge update, which is a fairly standard occurrence following an update process.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:

- **PnPUtil via PowerShell**: The execution of a driver installation using `pnputil.exe` through PowerShell is unusual especially if it was not part of an expected administrative task. This could potentially be employed as means to establish persistence or elevate privileges, depending on the nature of the driver.
  
- **Security Privileges**: The presence of escalated privileges and NTLM logon events might suggest a potential for lateral movement or insider threat if such privileges weren't authorized or were unusual for this user account.

- **Evtx Operations**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts at event log tampering which is a common practice among adversaries to conceal their activities.

Additional investigation should confirm whether these operations were expected/authorized or part of a broader malicious strategy involving privilege escalation and evasion tactics.

### Recommendations for Action:

1. **Verification of PowerShell Execution Context**: Confirm if the use of `pnputil.exe` was part of routine IT activities or if it aligns with expected changes performed by legitimate users.

2. **Review Privilege Assignments**: Validate the necessity and legitimacy of the special privileges granted to `admin_test`. Ensure there are no unauthorized privilege assignments.

3. **Monitor/Examine Log Activities**: Evaluate how `wevtutil.exe` was used, and conduct a review of event logs to check for anomalies or entries suggesting log manipulation efforts.

Based on the analysis above, my conclusion is:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation to rule out potential malicious intent or unauthorized operations. An in-depth security review of the affected systems, user account actions, and a check against unauthorized use should occur next."
Launch NSudo Executable,"Based on the provided event logs, a detailed analysis reveals potential indicators of malicious activity. Let's break down the findings across various log channels:

### Security Log:
- **Event ID 5379**: Multiple instances where there are failures to access target Microsoft accounts (`MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, `WindowsLive:(token)`, and `WindowsLive:(cert)`) with a ReturnCode of `3221226021`. This indicates an error, likely related to an account or security token, and might suggest attempts to access or authenticate using these accounts improperly or maliciously.

- **Event ID 4798**: Queries for user account information. This includes the default built-in accounts such as Administrator, Guest, and also a custom account (`admin_test` and `lplui`). The caller process is `taskhostw.exe`, which is normally benign, but under compromised situations could be leveraged for reconnaissance activities.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **PowerShell commands**: The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script which launches `NSudoLG.exe` with arguments to escalate privileges (`-U:T -P:E`). This is notably suspicious, as NSudo is often used to execute processes as TrustedInstaller, potentially allowing for privileged actions that are normally restricted.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1 & 5)**: Several processes are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, such as Windows PowerShell, wevtutil, whoami.exe, and hostname.exe. The use of tools like PowerShell alongside wevtutil (used for managing Windows event logs) is concerning in context, as it could indicate log manipulation efforts.
  
- The `NSudoLG.exe` process, as seen earlier in the PowerShell log, is confirmed with the Sysmon log, reinforcing the possibly malicious nature of this activity.

### Conclusion:
The combination of failed authentication attempts on potentially unauthorized accounts, execution of privilege escalation tools through PowerShell, and various potentially obfuscatory or reconnaissance-related processes all strongly suggest activities inconsistent with normal operations and potentially indicative of malicious intent or compromise.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs suggests a high likelihood of compromise, indicating possible unauthorized access and actions intended to escalate privileges or manipulate the system environment.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct an immediate cybersecurity incident response to contain and secure the affected system.
  - Investigate for any additional suspicious activities across the network.
  - Review and update security policies and access credentials.
  - Consider forensics analysis to determine the extent of any potential data exfiltration or additional compromises."
Scheduled Task Startup Script,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs for signs of malicious activity or compromise, several points of interest emerge:

1. **Frequent Utilization of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed in a very short timeframe. Typically, this command-line tool is used for querying, exporting, archiving event logs, and clearing event logs. Frequent use by the same user, especially in rapid succession, could indicate clearing of event logs to cover tracks, a common tactic used by malicious actors.
   
2. **Creation of Scheduled Tasks via `cmd.exe`:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process runs with arguments that create scheduled tasks using `schtasks.exe`. The tasks are set to execute `calc.exe` on user logon and system startup, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. While `calc.exe` (the Calculator app) is benign, the creation of such tasks might be used as a test or cover for later replacing `calc.exe` with a malicious executable.
   
3. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` to check for the current logged-in user and privileges can indicate a reconnaissance phase in the system to gather information about existing credentials and context.

4. **Execution of `cmd.exe`:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to create scheduled tasks could suggest attempts at persistence. These tasks have system-level execution profiles, which is unusual for regular operations, especially under the context of a non-administrative command prompt execution.

5. **Network and System Level Access by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:**
   - Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context is not necessarily suspicious but should be confirmed against routine scheduled updates since it runs under a high privilege context.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Behavior Detected:**
  - The rapid succession of `wevtutil.exe` executions hints at potentially malicious intent to tamper with system logs.
  - The creation of scheduled tasks triggering `calc.exe` is unconventional and indicates possible testing or manipulation of system processes to evaluate what can be executed silently.
  - The presence of privileged context when running certain processes poses a risk, particularly if administrative access wasn't appropriately sanctioned.

Based on the analysis above, the overall resolution for these logs is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted to confirm if these actions align with legitimate administrative tasks or updates, or if they represent a security breach.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Review Scheduled Tasks:**
   - Examine the newly created scheduled tasks on the system. Verify their legitimacy and, if suspicious, disable or remove them.
   
2. **Audit Log Activity:**
   - Investigate any gaps or clearings in the event logs that coincided with the `wevtutil.exe` executions to assess if log tampering occurred.

3. **Check for Potential Misuse of Credentials:**
   - Validate the accounts and privileges used to execute these operations, ensuring they align with expected activities for the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

4. **Conduct Threat Hunting:**
   - Use EDR to look for patterns or previously overlooked activities that might indicate lateral movement or unauthorized access on the network.

5. **Engage with Relevant IT Teams:**
   - Communicate findings with respective IT or SecOps teams to ascertain if changes were part of scheduled tasks, updates, or legitimate audits.

6. **Consider Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging for similar activities and enable alerts for potentially malicious patterns in Sysmon and Security logs."
Password Change on Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple invocations of standard Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` within a short timeframe can indicate an administrative maintenance task scripted to run multiple processes.
   - Usage of `cmd.exe` to run `ntdsutil` with the command `set dsrm password` and `sync from domain account %%username%%` is alarming. `ntdsutil` is a legitimate utility used for managing Active Directory, but it can also be used maliciously to manipulate directory services.

2. **Unusual Activity:**
   - The most suspicious activity in the logs is the use of `cmd.exe` for executing `ntdsutil`. Such a command can indicate an attempt to change or synchronize passwords, which is potentially a sign of unauthorized activity or preparation for a privilege escalation attempt.
   - The elevated privileges held by `admin_test` indicate a session with significant system control, which, if misused, can result in critical system changes.

3. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - There are time change events in the system and security logs, where the system time was set back by a few seconds. While not inherently malicious, time change events can potentially be used to manipulate event timings.
   
4. **Privilege Escalations:**
   - Security logs show the `admin_test` user with extensive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which could be dangerous if used maliciously.

5. **Network Interactions:**
   - There are logon events over NTLM with a workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`), suggesting remote connections. If `admin_test` is not known to use NTLM or connect remotely, this could be suspect.

### Conclusion:

- The command execution involving `ntdsutil` and syncing domain account passwords directly through `cmd.exe` is a highly concerning activity unless verified as a legitimate administrative process.
- The presence of high privilege usage, remote access, and possibly manipulated time settings also suggests that there may be unauthorized or suspicious activities taking place.

### Final Assessment:

- Given the critical nature of the operations executed, the suspicious use of domain utility commands through command line which could alter core system functionalities and security settings, and the possible remote unauthorized access, the activities logged are finely balanced on being harmful.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Investigate the Purpose of the Commands:**
   - Confirm with system administrators if the `ntdsutil` command execution was legitimate and part of an approved maintenance plan.

2. **User Validation:**
   - Validate if `admin_test` was authorized to perform all operations and check for any anomaly in user behavior and access patterns.

3. **Audit Remote Access:**
   - Investigate the remote desktop or NTLM authentications to ensure they match with known, expected connections.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Consider increased logging and monitoring of key activities from high-privileged accounts and domain utility usage to quickly detect any subsequent suspicious actions.

By addressing these issues, further investigations can determine if the observed suspicious activities could potentially escalate into a security incident."
Injection SID-History with mimikatz,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided Sysmon logs, several aspects suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - There is a notable command-line execution by `cmd.exe` that runs a script from the Temp directory: 
     - `CommandLine` for `cmd.exe`: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\x64\\script.exe`
     - Another `cmd.exe` process executed the following command:
       ```plaintext
       ""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\x64\\script.exe ""privilege::debug"" ""sid::patch"" ""sid::add /sid:S-1-5-21-1004336348-1177238915-682003330-1134 /sam:$env:username"" ""exit""
       ```
     This command sequence is highly suspicious due to its attempt to manipulate Windows privileges and groups, a common technique used in privilege escalation attacks.

2. **Process Tree and Parent Processes:**
   - The parent process for the suspicious `cmd.exe` is `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating that Windows Remote Management or a similar service might have been involved or compromised to execute unauthorized commands.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are being executed. `wevtutil.exe` is a Windows command-line utility for exporting event logs, which could indicate an attempt to tamper with or clear event logs to cover tracks.

4. **Execution of Known Windows Utilities:**
   - Standard utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, possibly suggesting an information-gathering phase of an attack.

5. **Integrity Levels:**
   - The events are happening with processes running at a high integrity level indicating the activities were performed with high privileges, increasing the risk of system compromise.

6. **Hash Values:**
   - The hash values present do not inherently confirm malice. However, the context in which certain scripts and applications are run may require further review against known threat intelligence databases for any matches with malware signatures.

### Assessment

The behavior observed in the logs, including the execution chain from `wsmprovhost.exe` to `cmd.exe` with high-integrity context, complex command-line arguments aimed at privilege escalation, and suspicious binary executions, strongly suggests malicious activity or a potential compromise of the system.

### Threats and Risks

- **Privilege Escalation:** The command-line attempts to adjust security privileges is a severe risk.
- **Persistence/Information Gathering:** Execution of standard utilities could indicate attempts to profile the environment or establish persistence.
- **Potential Log Tampering:** Use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests attempts to modify or clear event logs to hide activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- Quarantine the affected system to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct deeper analysis, including memory dumps and network analysis to identify any further indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Validate the hashes of suspicious files against known malware databases.
- Review system access controls and audit logs for unauthorized access patterns.
- Strengthen security monitoring and incident response policies to detect such abnormalities in the future.

### Resolution

Based on the exhibited behavior and potential risks identified, the resolution for these logs is: **MALICIOUS**. The logs provide strong evidence of unauthorized and potentially malicious actions warranting immediate investigation and mitigation measures."
Create a new time provider,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out that suggest potential malicious activity.

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- A PowerShell script was executed with unusual commands, notably:
  - `net stop w32time` and `net start w32time`: This commands stop and start the Windows Time Service.
  - `Copy-Item`: Copies a DLL file (`fileTest.dll`) from a temporary directory to a public directory.
  - `reg add`: Modifies the Windows Registry to include a new time provider using the previously copied DLL.

The execution of this PowerShell script is suspicious for several reasons:
- Loading of a new DLL into the Windows Time Service without clear reason. This could indicate an attempt to execute a malicious payload or persist by exploiting the Windows Time Service.
- The commands seem organized to introduce persistence or unauthorized configuration changes to the system.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- The execution of multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `reg.exe` processes is noted, which can signify registry tampering.
- The process `whoami.exe` is executed multiple times, which may indicate that the attacker is attempting to verify user permissions.
- The presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes doesn’t usually indicate danger but should be evaluated in the context of the specific situation on the host.

#### Security Logs:
- There is a `Security-Auditing` event (Event ID 4616), which signals a system time change. This could potentially be used to cover tracks or desynchronize security tools from logging true timings of events.
  
### Assessment and Recommendation

The behavior witnessed in the PowerShell execution and registry manipulation indicates potential malicious activity. The activity suggests an attempt to introduce and execute unauthorized code through the Windows Time Service using a custom DLL. Such actions align with common techniques used by attackers to establish persistence and execute malicious code with system privileges.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Isolate the affected host (Server002)** from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **Perform a comprehensive scan and detailed forensic analysis** on Server002 to identify and contain any malicious files or software. Investigate additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) related to loaded DLLs and registry changes.
3. **Revert unauthorized Registry changes**, particularly those involving time providers and newly added time service configurations.
4. **Remove any unauthorized DLLs** from public directories, ensuring that they are not utilized by any services.
5. **Review and monitor logs** for similar activity on other machines within the network.
6. **Update security measures and policies** to prevent future similar incidents, including stricter PowerShell execution policies and enhanced monitoring of system service modifications.

Prompt response is critical to prevent any lateral movement or exfiltration of data from the compromised system."
Process Injection with Go using UuidFromStringA WinAPI,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs for the CEO's machine on Server002, several entries and behaviors are worth noting for their potential security implications:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The events indicate multiple instances of system time being changed:
     - Security events 30349 and 30350 show that the system time was changed by `svchost.exe`. 
     - Time discrepancies can indicate malicious attempts to hide the true sequence of events or evade detection by timestamp-based security controls.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - PowerShell event (EDR alert) indicates the execution of a script using `UuidFromStringA.exe` with unusual arguments (`-debug`), launched from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\`).
   - Temporary directories are commonly used by malware for execution to avoid detection, especially with obfuscated or unexpected command-line arguments.

3. **Execution of Unexpected Processes:**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` within a short time frame may imply attempts to gather system information or manipulate logs.
   - Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` as a child process to various command-line utilities could indicate attempts to interact with or manipulate the console's appearance.

### Malicious Indicators:

- **PowerShell Scripting:** 
  - The usage of PowerShell with specific binaries (`UuidFromStringA.exe`) from a user temp directory signifies potential fileless malware activity or exploit attempts, characteristic of advanced persistent threats or targeted attacks.

### Assessment:
Based on the events and behaviors noted in the logs, there are substantial indicators of suspicious activity, particularly regarding time manipulation, unusual PowerShell commands, and the use of system utilities in rapid succession. The provenance and nature of `UuidFromStringA.exe` are unclear, and given its execution context from a transient path, it poses a significant risk.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation:**
   - Inspect the content and origin of `UuidFromStringA.exe`. Verify its legitimacy and whether it's necessary for business operations.
   - Conduct an in-depth analysis of the processes executed around the time manipulation events to understand their root cause.

- **Security Controls:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell execution and consider enforcing script block logging and transcription to capture attempted script activities.
   - Analyze firewall logs and network traffic from the CEO's machine to identify any unusual outbound connections that could correlate with unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.

- **User Awareness:** 
   - Inform and educate users about the risks of downloading or executing unsanctioned software, particularly for users with elevated privileges, such as the CEO."
"Scheduled Task (""Ghost Task"") via Registry Key Manipulation","### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Here's the analysis based on the provided logs from the Application, Security, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and System log categories:

#### Application Log
- Contains benign events indicating that Windows Defender is turned on. 
- EventID 15 indicates security product state on, showing Windows Defender's operational status.

#### Sysmon Log
The Sysmon logs provide the most relevant data for identifying suspicious activities:

- Multiple processes were executed:
  - `powershell.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell usage by an admin isn’t always suspicious but can be utilized in attacks.
  - `wevtutil.exe` executed multiple times. This tool is used for managing event logs. Its frequent execution could indicate tampering or log clearing activity.
  - `cmd.exe` with a complex command line and referenced `script.exe` and `GhostTask.exe`. The use of temp directory paths, ghost task creation, and notepad invocation indicates a potentially unauthorized script execution.
- High integrity level execution which indicates these commands were likely run with elevated privileges.
- Frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` overlapping with potentially suspicious process executions. While not inherently malicious, this could point to process obfuscation or hiding.
- The usage of `whoami.exe` may suggest reconnaissance activity, although its use in isolation isn’t necessarily malicious.

#### System, Security, and Windows PowerShell Logs
- No relevant data or logs indicating immediate suspicious or malicious activity.

### Summary of Potential Risks & Indicators:
- **Potential Indicator of Recon Activity:**  Running `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` with High Integrity, especially following administrative-actions like PowerShell usage.
- **Anomalous Command Line Execution:** Complex `cmd.exe` invocation involving `script.exe` and `GhostTask.exe` within a temp path, potentially indicating covert task scheduling or script-based activity.
- **Event Log Tampering/Risk:** Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` may suggest attempts to clear or alter log records, thereby covering tracks of other activities.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Validate Administrative Tasks:** Confirm if the `powershell.exe` execution and associated command lines were intentional or scheduled by an authorized admin for a legitimate reason.
2. **Investigate `cmd.exe` Execution:** Examine the rationale behind executing `cmd.exe` with complex command lines involving potential ghost tasks.
3. **Audit User Actions:** Check if `SERVER002\admin_test` performed these actions knowingly. Look for patterns indicating misuse of admin privileges.
4. **Review and Harden Logging:** Ensure logs aren't being tampered with, and employ alerting on critical changes to logging systems.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain suspicious activities, particularly the use of scripts and potential log tampering by `wevtutil.exe`. While these actions do not definitively confirm malicious activity, they require further investigation to ensure there's no compromise or unauthorized access on the system."
HKCU - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The event log entries reflect normal system operations such as `svchost.exe` managing time service updates. There are no indications of anomalies here, as time adjustments and `svchost.exe` activities are typical in Windows environments.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The events show the execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe`. 
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` is noteworthy, specifically with the command-line content focused on registry manipulation:
     ```powershell
     ""powershell.exe"" & {if (!(Test-Path -Path \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\"")){ New-Item -ItemType Key -Path  \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\"", }, Set-ItemProperty -Path  \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\Run\"" -Name \""filetest\"" -Value \""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\""}
     ```
   - This script is creating a registry key that would execute `calc.exe`. Modifying the registry to achieve persistence (in `Policies\Explorer\Run`) is often associated with malicious techniques.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Time adjustment entries using `svchost.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This is expected behavior and doesn't indicate privilege escalation or malicious activity itself.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Entries from the Windows Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`) show characteristic routine service events without suspicious attributes.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Mirrors the Sysmon log analysis regarding suspicious PowerShell activity aiming to set up a persistent execution path via registry keys pointing to `calc.exe`.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The activities involving the execution of `powershell.exe` to modify registry keys for persistence are suspicious. It shows signs of an attempt to establish an autostart mechanism for the `calc.exe` application, commonly used as a benign example in testing but within compromised environments may reflect an initial foothold or persistence method for malware.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- **Persistence Mechanism:** The modification of registry entries to ensure specific scripts run at logon enhances an attacker's ability to maintain access.
- **Potential Undetected Malicious Activity:** While the observed behavior does not in itself confirm malicious activity, the context is critical. If such patterns are unexpected on the CEO's machine, they warrant further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Further Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system to determine if other non-standard scripts or executables are tied to this modification that might imply a more substantial compromise.
- **System Hardening:** Implement monitoring on PowerShell activities with stricter auditing, and consider restrictions on scripts that can modify registry paths related to automatic executions.
- **Alerting and Remediation Plan:** Alert relevant IT security teams to monitor similar patterns across other systems and reinforce user training on the implications of irregular PowerShell scripts.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS.** The evidence points to potentially unwanted behavior with a base for persistence that requires more context and in-depth investigation to rule out malicious intent."
Admin Account Manipulate,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon thorough examination of the provided logs, several key points need to be addressed:

#### 1. Time Manipulations

- **Event ID 4616 and Sysmon Event**: The system time was changed, which is typically done by the Windows Time Service (`svchost.exe`) and is generally benign. However, time adjustments outside of normal bounds, particularly if frequent, could be concerning if they obscure malicious activities or logs.

#### 2. PowerShell Execution

- **Sysmon and PowerShell Logs**: A PowerShell script was executed which performs arbitrary commands including renaming local user accounts. The specific script in question attempted to rename an administrator account (originally named ""Administrator"") to a name prefixed with ""HaHa_"". This behavior is a strong indication of automation used for unauthorized access and privilege escalation attempts, altering user attributes and names to potentially bypass controls or logging.

#### 3. User and Privilege Management

- **Security Event ID 4738 and 4781**: This shows the alteration of the user account attributes and the successful renaming of the user. These changes corroborate the activities observed in the PowerShell logs and indicate illicit modification of a critical user account.

#### 4. Process Executions

- **Sysmon Events**: Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` could suggest administrative attempts possibly related to event log management or attempts to hide certain activities. The `wevtutil.exe` is used to fetch or clear event logs, which can be potential indicators when used by unexpected users.

#### 5. Network Logon

- **Security Event ID 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: The logon by user `admin_test` was made using NTLM from a remote workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). Privileges assigned (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) are highly sensitive and could indicate non-standard use or possible abuse.

### Assessment

- The PowerShell scripts executed indicate malicious intentions aimed at altering administrative accounts.
- The modifications to user accounts, particularly in renaming and attribute changes, align with typical tactics used to persist or gain unauthorized access.
  
### Threats and Risks

- **Privilege Escalation**: The manipulation and renaming of user accounts indicate a likely attempt at privilege escalation.
- **Unauthorized Access**: Remote logins using NTLM suggest possible credential misuse.
- **System Integrity**: The potential alteration of event logs poses a risk to auditing and system integrity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the script executed to rename user accounts, which strongly indicates malicious behavior, the logs indeed reflect actions with a clear intent to compromise the system. Immediate steps should be taken to:

1. **Contain**: Secure the affected host by isolating it from the network.
2. **Revert Changes**: Correct any unauthorized account changes and review all local and domain user accounts for unauthorized changes.
3. **Investigate Further**: Perform a forensic investigation on the machine for any additional malicious artifacts.
4. **Harden Systems**: Review and enhance security measures, including PowerShell logging, user audit trails, and administrative account monitoring.

It is critical to investigate how unauthorized PowerShell script execution was allowed and address any vulnerabilities in the network and user permissions configurations."
Scheduled task Local,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
The provided logs contain several elements of potential concern:

1. **Continuous Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - A series of Sysmon EventID 5 logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - These executions happen in close succession, which could indicate a scripted or automated process.

2. **Creation of Scheduled Task using `schtasks`:**
   - Sysmon EventID 1 details a suspicious execution of `cmd.exe` with a `/c` flag to create a scheduled task using `SCHTASKS`.
   - The task named 'spawn' runs `cmd.exe`. Invoking `schtasks.exe` to create tasks on a machine without clear administrative changes or user permission explanations is suspicious.

3. **High-Privilege Logons:**
   - The security log indicates logons (EventID 4624) with Privilege Assignments (EventID 4672), both granting high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be exploited for malicious purposes.
   - Logon Type 3 from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) suggests these might be network logons, potentially indicating lateral movement or unauthorized access.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
   - `whoami.exe` was executed by the same user. Frequently used in reconnaissance to confirm the current user identity and privileges.

5. **`cmd.exe` Execution with Parameters:**
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c SCHTASKS /Create /SC ONCE /TN spawn /TR C:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /ST 20:10` is a red flag.
   - It suggests an attempt to create a scheduled task that might start a command shell with potentially harmful intentions.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators
- **Use of Scheduled Tasks for Persistence:** The creation of a scheduled task to run `cmd.exe` is often a technique used to maintain persistence on a compromised machine.
- **Privileged Operations:** The system logs reflect operations performed with high privilege, particularly with sensitive rights that are often indicative of actions taken to disable system protections or explore system internals.

### Assessment
The combination of privileged operations, scheduled tasks, and the context in which common administrative tools are used aligns with patterns typically observed in security incidents involving persistence mechanisms and potential lateral movement within a network.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- Possible persistence mechanism established through scheduled tasks.
- Potential unauthorized access and use of highly privileged rights.
- Indicators of system reconnaissance and possible lateral movement.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Verification of Scheduled Tasks:**
   - Review and confirm the legitimacy of the `spawn` scheduled task and the user activities around its creation.
   
2. **Review User Privilege Assignments:**
   - Verify the roles and permissions granted to `admin_test` and ensure appropriate access controls are enforced.

3. **Monitor Network and User Activity:**
   - Increase monitoring of network activity originating from the noted external workstation and user account.
   
4. **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis:**
   - Further investigate the specifics of the logged actions to ascertain whether the logs captured are reflective of broader malicious activity.

5. **Consider Blocks or Alerts:**
   - Configure alerts for attempts to create or modify scheduled tasks or similar administrative processes without proper context.

### Resolution
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The detected activities indicate potentially unauthorized actions that require further investigation to rule out malicious intent or compromise. Additional attention should be directed towards validating the user's actions and ensuring that no unauthorized persistence mechanisms have been introduced."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI,"## Detailed Log Analysis

### Application Log
1. **Windows Defender status**:
   - The log confirms that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is standard and expected behavior.
   
2. **Software Protection Platform Service**:
   - Regular events related to the Software Protection Platform Service (`EventID` 16384 and 903) indicate time-based triggers without anomalies or errors. These entries do not show suspicious behavior.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- An invocation of PowerShell through `powershell.exe` with the command `{C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\CreateThread.exe -debug}` is observed. Executing binaries from a Temp directory is unusual and suspicious as this location is often used by malicious actors to execute unauthorized code.
  
### Security Log
- **EventID 4616 (System Time Changed)**: 
  - Two entries where system time adjustments occurred. These entries are not inherently malicious but warrant correlation with other events to check if they were manipulated as part of a broader attack strategy.
  
### Sysmon Log
- Multiple suspicious entries involving `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` (both legitimate Windows processes) initiated with `SERVER002\admin_test`:
  - These events, while showing a legitimate user, could be part of a larger sequence hijacking routine tasks for malicious purposes. Their frequent recurrence suggests programmatic control.
- A suspicious process creation:
  - Involving `powershell.exe` with the command `[C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\CreateThread.exe -debug]`. This matches the suspicious PowerShell log entry and suggests an execution of possibly malicious code.
  
### System Log
- **EventID 1, 24** related to time and timezone changes correspond to the security log. This observation alone might not denote malicious activity unless correlated with specific exploit tactics.
  
### Combined Findings
- Invocation of a PowerShell script which launches an executable from the Temp directory using a disguised path is atypical and hints at a potentially malicious script execution.
- Use of `CreateThread.exe` with a debug flag suggests the execution of potentially harmful code, possibly cloaked from regular monitoring.

## Assessment
Given the findings, especially the execution of an unrecognized executable via PowerShell from a temporary path, this investigation highlights **SUSPICIOUS** activity. There are strong indicators of potential malicious execution that require further scrutiny to determine intent and impact.

## Resolution
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance**:
  - Immediately isolate the host (if further investigation suggests malicious behavior) to prevent lateral movement and data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation on `CreateThread.exe` found in the Temp directory.
  - Review and verify user `admin_test` activity logs for unauthorized access.
  - Strengthen monitoring on the CEO's machine for unusual PowerShell usage and execution of binaries from non-standard paths.
  - Coordinate with IT to scan for indicators of compromise across the network."
Remote Service Installation CMD,"To assess the compiled Windows event logs, we need to identify any signs of suspicious or malicious activity. The logs span across Sysmon, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell logs, and System logs, but for brevity and clarity, only those with significant findings are discussed below.

**1. Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Unusual Process Execution:**
     - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in quick succession under the admin account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) might indicate an attempt to manipulate or query the event logs.
     - Execution of `powershell.exe` by the same admin account without any visible command-line arguments is suspicious, as attackers often use PowerShell for later-stage exploitation.
     - A critical finding is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the use of `sc.exe` to create and start a service (`fileTestService_CMD`) for `fileService.exe`. This not typical behavior unless regularly maintained for admin purposes and signifies a noteworthy event.

   - **Indicators of Privilege Escalation or Persistence:**
     - `sc.exe` usage attempts to create a new service which starts automatically and runs under the LocalSystem account. This behavior is often associated with attempts of gaining persistence or privilege escalation.

   - **Application Executed:**
     - The presence of `fileService.exe` executed by the command `sc.exe` raises a red flag. The file located within `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\` is in a user-specific temp directory, which is unusual for benign service execution paths.

**2. Application Logs:**
   - An event indicates that the service named `fileService` started successfully. This aligns with the suspicious service setup observed in the Sysmon logs.

**3. System Logs:**
   - The Service Control Manager log shows an executed service with the auto start type, supporting the suspect execution seen in Sysmon logs.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The sequence of events is highly indicative of malicious activity. The creation and starting of a new service from a temp directory using `sc.exe`, coupled with the use of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` execution, suggests that an actor attempted to establish persistence on the machine and possibly cover tracks by querying or modifying event logs.

Given these findings, the situation is classified as:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of actions consistent with common attack techniques aimed at persistence and potential log modification.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the server to identify any additional indicators of compromise or footprints of the adversary.
   - Verify the integrity of critical system and application logs to determine if logs have been altered.
   - Analyze the `fileService.exe` for malicious functionalities or indicators of tampering.

3. **Eradication and Recovery:**
   - Remove unauthorized applications and services identified during the forensic analysis.
   - Reassess security policy to improve hardening against similar future attacks, focusing on privileged account monitoring and application whitelisting.

4. **Prevention and Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for abnormal usage of administrative tools such as PowerShell and `sc.exe`.
   - Regularly update and patch the systems to safeguard against known vulnerabilities exploited in similar attacks.

These steps should be coordinated with the incident response team to ensure comprehensive mitigation and security strengthening against further potential threats."
Task Scheduler via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell event logs indicate that a PowerShell script was executed using the `IEX (iwr...)` command, which is a common way to download and execute scripts directly from the internet. This is a suspicious activity typically observed in malicious scripts.
   - The URL from which the script is being downloaded is hosted on GitHub (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`). This could be an attempt to execute potentially harmful scripts.
   - The use of command-line arguments with `Invoke-script` and explicit references to temporary files used by Office products (`Word`) could suggest an exploit using document macros or malicious automation in Office.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events show the spawning of processes like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others shortly after each other initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil` is used to export event logs (`epl` command), indicating possible log manipulation or exfiltration attempt.
   - The presence of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` frequently and in sequence also suggests automation or scripting that might be suspicious, particularly when paired with PowerShell and network activity.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Scripts and command-line applications such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are being executed, possibly mapping the system environment or manipulating logs.

4. **Network and Automated Activity:**
   - The installation logs for Microsoft Edge Updates (`setup.exe`, `mini_installer.exe`) appear to be legitimate activities performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. However, the presence of a sequence of installation processes amid suspicious scripting activity may require further inspection to ensure they aren’t being manipulated for malicious purposes.

#### Assessment:

- The combination of PowerShell downloading and executing scripts from the internet, coupled with sequential execution of various administrative commands and tools, suggests a potentially compromised system.
- The activities observed align with tactics used for initial access, execution, and potential lateral movement, as well as for covering tracks by modifying or exporting logs.
- The `admin_test` user appears to be performing these actions, indicating possible misuse of elevated privileges, further supporting suspicions of a compromise.

#### Threats/Risks Identified:

- **Potentially Malicious PowerShell Script Execution**: Executing scripts directly from the internet is indicative of potential unauthorized access or execution of harmful code.
- **Logging and Forensics Evasion**: The usage of `wevtutil` to export logs might be an attempt to evade detection or prepare for future steps that alter system state or perform data exfiltration.
- **Privileges Misuse**: `admin_test` using `PowerShell` for script execution points to either a compromised user account or misuse by an insider.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

#### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to contain any further propagation or exfiltration of data.
2. **Full System Scan**: Conduct a comprehensive malware scan using updated antivirus and EDR tools.
3. **Investigate and Block Malicious URLs**: Investigate and restrict the URL used for script download to prevent similar attempts.
4. **Audit User Activities**: Review and monitor user activities, especially `admin_test`, and validate if the account is compromised or misused.
5. **Log Analysis and Recovery**: Check logs across other systems for similar activity, ensure logs are intact and unaltered, and secure log storage against tampering.
6. **Consult Threat Intelligence**: Compare indicators from logs with threat intelligence to identify known patterns or entities.
7. **Inform Relevant Stakeholders**: Alert IT security teams and executive management about the findings and potential risks.
8. **Enhance Security Measures**: Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and enforce usage of constrained language modes."
Change Startup Folder - HKCU Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value,"Upon meticulously analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity or security compromise:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are multiple logs indicating the execution of a PowerShell command. The command involves creating a directory in the temporary folder, copying `calc.exe` (the calculator application) to this directory, and modifying registry keys to adjust the startup folder settings for the current user.
   - **Suspicion:** These actions are unusual and indicative of a tactic often used in malicious activities where executables are hidden within innocuous locations and registry keys are modified to ensure persistence.
   - **Concern:** Although `calc.exe` is a legitimate application, creating such scripts can sometimes be used as decoys in attacks or tests of persistence mechanisms.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that a user named `admin_test` logged on with special privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others).
   - **Suspicion:** Granting advanced privileges is a technique often associated with privilege escalation attacks. The timing coinciding with odd PowerShell scripts could suggest privilege abuse.
   
3. **System Logs:**
   - Time changes logged are within normal adjustments. No outright security concerns within this context.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Indicates that several `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes ran under the context of `admin_test`. These processes are commonly used for system management but could be part of malicious activity if exploited.
   - A `powershell.exe` process matching the previously highlighted suspicious command is logged. This corresponds to the command execution in the PowerShell logs.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Contains entries from Microsoft Edge Update processes which appear to be routine updates. There are no direct signs of malicious alterations within these specific entries.

### Assessment:
The combination of registry modifications to influence startup behavior, the copying of executables to unusual directories, and the presence of elevated privilege use by `admin_test` suggests potentially inappropriate or unauthorized conduct.
  
### Recommendation:
- **Further Investigation:** To ensure that this is not a benign administrative script, verify the origin and intent of these PowerShell commands and account activities.
- **Containment:** Monitor and, if necessary, restrict `admin_test` actions, implementing enhanced auditing.
- **Mitigation:** Consider validating the integrity and hash of executables like `calc.exe` to affirm no tampering.
- **Response:** Engage with the person responsible for the `admin_test` account for clarification on their recent activities and run any necessary endpoint detection and response scans.

### Conclusion:
Given the factors present in the logs, classify this finding as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted to determine if this is a potential security incident or a case of unauthorized use of tools by accounts with significant privileges."
Azure - adding user to Azure role in subscription,"### Analysis of the Logs

The collection of logs from the CEO's machine (Server002) reveals key pieces of information relevant for identifying potential malicious activity. Below is the detailed assessment:

1. **Security Events (Event ID 4798 and 4799)**:
   - Event ID 4798 indicates a query regarding the local group's attributes, and several account-related events were logged. For example, multiple events queried information about various user accounts, including ""Guest"", ""Administrator"", ""admin_test"", ""DefaultAccount,"" ""lplui,"" ""sshd,"" ""testing,"" ""WDAGUtilityAccount,"" and the group ""Administrators"".
   - The consistent usage of `CompatTelRunner.exe` to query these attributes is unusual since this executable is typically related to Windows Telemetry rather than account queries. This might indicate living-off-the-land behavior where native processes are used for reconnaissance or further exploitation.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` running under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` indicate potential scripted or automated activities. Specifically, the `powershell.exe` instance executed a script involving Azure Resource Management, examining and manipulating Azure AD users and their role assignments:
     - The script connects to an Azure account and attempts to assign roles to specific users. This action involves privilege and role management, often targeted in account takeover scenarios.
     - The script uses hard-coded credentials and suggests automation or a lack of sophisticated credential management.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs corroborate the Sysmon findings by showing script execution involving modules related to Azure resources. The script imports the Az.Resources module to manage user roles within an Azure environment.
   - The use of `ConvertTo-SecureString` with plain text passwords and the assembly of PSCredential objects implies a scripted approach to either automate role assignment or exfiltrate sensitive user and role data from an Azure subscription.

4. **User and Process Behavior**:
   - The observation of high-integrity level processes involving PowerShell and telemetry tools (CompatTelRunner) is indicative of potentially unauthorized administrative activity. The timing and method used to execute these commands align with indications of lateral movement or reconnaissance.
   - The command-line arguments associated with `CompatTelRunner.exe` suggest deviation from its normal telemetry collection behavior, further solidifying suspicions of Living off the Land Binaries (LOLBins) usage.

### Conclusion

The logs reveal activities that are highly suspicious in nature:
- The use of `CompatTelRunner.exe` for account queries and processes indicative of elevated privilege actions.
- Execution of PowerShell scripts aimed at managing Azure resources and roles with hard-coded credentials.
- These actions are consistent with tactics frequently used in advanced persistent threats (APT) or sophisticated attack methodologies involving lateral movement and credential access.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

While there are clear signs of abnormal activity suggestive of malicious intent, further investigation is needed to confirm a definitive compromise. Potential malicious activities include scripted manipulation of Azure resources and unauthorized privilege allocation using legitimate Windows processes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Restrict or review activities linked to the `admin_test` user account to prevent further unauthorized access.

2. **Deep-Dive Analysis**:
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the machine, focusing on process trees, memory dumps, and any trace of known threats from threat intelligence sources.
   - Look for follow-up indicators of compromise (IOCs) that could link this activity to known threat actors.

3. **Review and Remediate**:
   - Review Azure AD activity logs for unexpected changes or access patterns.
   - Assess the use of credentials found in scripts and scripts' footprints across other endpoints.
   - Patch or update applications that may provide vectors for Living off the Land-style attacks.

4. **Strengthen Security**:
   - Enhance logging around privilege user activities and implement anomaly detection to quickly spot deviations.
   - Educate users about the importance of credential security, especially around scripts and automation tools.

Proceed with these steps to confirm whether the activity evolves into a verified malicious event or remains a suspicious anomaly with potential benign explanations."
Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, several observations can be made with regard to potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **System Log and Security Log Analysis**:
   - The logs consistently refer to changes in system time; however, there doesn't appear to be anything immediately suspicious in the time changes themselves. Time adjustments are usually benign, especially if they are related to time synchronization services.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - There is a recurring theme of various processes run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Among these, the most noteworthy entry involves a command prompt (`cmd.exe`) executing a command with registry manipulation and task scheduling:
     - The command involves adding a registry entry task that encodes some base64 data (`cGluZyAxMjcuMC4wLjE=`) and creates a scheduled task utilizing the `schtasks.exe`. Decoding the base64 reveals a potential IP `ping 127.0.0.1`, which itself is benign, but this format of encoding suggests obfuscation which could be used to mask malicious intent.
     - The command also utilizes PowerShell's `Invoke-Expression` with content retrieved from the registry, generally a red flag as this method is often used as part of an attack chain.

3. **Indicators of Persistence Mechanism**:
   - The creation of a scheduled task that invokes PowerShell to execute a script from a registry key suggests an intention to maintain persistence on the system. This behavior often indicates an attempt to establish a foothold that can be triggered daily.

4. **Presence of Administrative Tools**:
   - The frequent invocation of utilities like `reg.exe`, `schtasks.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and use of `wsmprovhost.exe` by an administrative user account could indicate engagement in actions requiring elevated privileges, potentially indicative of lateral movement or privilege escalation activities.

**Clear Assessment**: The suspect execution of encoded and obfuscated command lines, registry manipulation in conjunction with scheduled task creation, particularly under an administrative account context, is typically indicative of malicious activities. Such actions suggest an unauthorized persistence mechanism being established.

**Threat/Risk Identified**: There appears to be an attempt to execute potentially malicious scripts utilizing encoded registry entries—indicative of advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in sophisticated attacks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**: 
- Conduct a thorough investigation into registry entries, particularly those under `HKCU\SOFTWARE\file-data.005`.
- Analyze scheduled tasks for any unauthorized entries, specifically scrutinizing those associated with PowerShell executions.
- Perform a security audit of `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities for potential unauthorized actions.
- Monitor network activity for connections to unexpected destinations, potentially related to persistence/command and control channels.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs indicate activity consistent with malicious behavior, such as setting up a persistence mechanism with obfuscated commands and potential administrative misuse. Immediate action and further investigation are warranted to mitigate risks and secure the environment."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Special Character in Password,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and findings are made:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell script indicates an attempt to change the user password. The script checks for a credential file in the user's local app data directory and attempts to use it to reset the password.
   - It checks if the old password matches the one stored in the credential file and if not, proceeds to change it. The script handles scenarios where the stored password is incorrect by removing the credential file if there's an error (error code 86).
   - The usage of PowerShell for credential manipulation, especially related to passwords, is often sensitive and can be a sign of a compromise if done unexpectedly. The `Set-ADAccountPassword` command is used, typically requiring elevated privileges or being part of an administrative task.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are seen. These commands are not inherently malicious but can be used in reconnaissance or for auditing purposes.
   - There is also legitimate activity related to Microsoft Edge as seen from the `setup.exe` processes, which appear to be part of an update or installation process for Microsoft Edge.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - The security log with Event ID 4799 records group membership enumeration, possibly related to the ongoing processes surrounding the Edge setup.

4. **General Observations**:
   - The user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is associated with most of the activities observed in the logs. This account appears to have high integrity level access, possibly indicating an administrative or elevated access.
   - The PowerShell script execution is occurring on `Server002`, the computer in question, and the user involved is consistently `admin_test`.

### Assessment

The PowerShell script execution in the context of resetting user passwords alongside the usage of administrative commands like `Set-ADAccountPassword` on a server is a strong indicator of sensitive activity. If the context for this script is unexplained by ordinary system administration tasks or if unexpected by the security team, this could signal suspicious behavior. Moreover, the fact that the password attempted to be set has explicit criteria (i.e., `UpperLowerLong333noSpecialChar`) could indicate an unauthorized attempt to standardize or control passwords to gain access.

While the Microsoft Edge update activity seems benign and related to software maintenance, the password-related activity nonetheless requires attention due to its potential impact on account integrity and security.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
1. **Investigate the `admin_test` account**: Confirm whether the actions were legitimate, possibly part of an approved administrative task or maintenance.
2. **Review Changes to the Password Policies**: Ensure such changes are authorized and fall within policy compliance.
3. **Monitor for Reoccurring Activity**: Keep track for any repeat or further unauthorized attempts at password or credential manipulation.
4. **Enhance Security Auditing**: Implement stricter monitoring on PowerShell activities, especially those involving password-related changes.

Based on these considerations, it is recommended to flag this activity as **SUSPICIOUS** for further review and verification."
Bad Potato,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Sysmon Logs

1. **Windows Security Health Service Execution**:
   - The event with `ProcessId` 4256 shows the execution of `SecurityHealthService.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process responsible for managing security configuration settings. This is standard behavior and not indicative of malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The event with `ProcessId` 4576 reveals the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell usage on a server by an admin is not unusual, but it warrants scrutiny because PowerShell can often be leveraged by attackers for malicious purposes. However, this log lacks specific command-line arguments, making it difficult to assess intent immediately.

3. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple events show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil` is used to manage Windows Event Logs, and `conhost.exe` is tied to console windows. While frequent, these could suggest normal administration activities or scripting processes unless accompanied by suspicious arguments (which aren't provided here).

4. **Command Line Arguments in PowerShell**:
   - There's a notable PowerShell command that starts a process (`script.exe`) and another (`notepad.exe`), waits (likely for the processes to execute), and then forcibly stops them. This behavior is somewhat unusual and could be interpreted as an attempt to suppress or alter log data or automate a task using non-standard methods. The directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles` also raises a red flag as it suggests temporary or user manipulated scripts.

5. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - The execution of these commands, usually employed to gather system and identity information, suggests an attempt to profile the system environment.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs include multiple entries related to updating Microsoft Edge which appears standard as it references official update paths and applications (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `setup.exe`).

### Application Logs

- **Software Protection Platform Service** and **Windows Defender Functionality**:
  - The logs for the Windows Security Center showing that Windows Defender is in an 'ON' state, indicates that Windows security services are active, which is good from a security perspective.

### PowerShell Logs

- **PowerShell Script Execution**:
  - The PowerShell logs echo the activity captured by Sysmon logs concerning PowerShell usage. The script sections show complex actions like managing processes, which is often indicative of either advanced administration or possibly attempting something subversive.

## Assessment and Resolution

Taking into account all logged activities, several entries can be considered typical for system administration purposes, especially on a server. However, the complex PowerShell activity involving script execution and the use of temporary folders for scripts could be potentially anomalous, requiring additional context for confirmation.

### Final Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS

Thus, based on the provided log entries, the activities, particularly around PowerShell usage and repeated execution of certain utilities, warrant further investigation to rule out their malicious intent. The next steps should include:

- Reviewing the actual contents of the scripts or binaries involved (e.g., `script.exe`) in the PowerShell session.
- Confirming the legitimacy of the PowerShell commands with the responsible admin.
- Checking for any unauthorized changes or access rights on system files and settings.
- Closely monitoring the system for further suspicious activities."
Add a driver,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Summary of Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The logs show multiple execution instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These are typical Windows utilities and normally, frequent execution might indicate a script or automated task running, but in isolation, they aren't inherently suspicious.
  
2. **Execution of Command-Line Tools:**
   - `cmd.exe` is observed executing `pnputil.exe /add-driver ""C:\Windows\INF\usbstor.inf""`. This command is used to add a driver, which is not typical for an administrative task and could indicate an attempt to configure or install additional drivers that might not have been approved.

3. **Usage of Tools for System Information:**
   - Tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are used. These can be normal for a user or administrator to check their environment, but they can also be part of activity performed by attackers to understand the network and authenticated context.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events related to the manipulation of system time as seen in the `Security` and `System` logs, with the `EventID` 4616 showing changes to `PreviousTime` and `NewTime`. This is uncommon and might have been used to obfuscate malicious activities by altering timestamps.

5. **Processes Running as NT AUTHORITY:**
   - Processes like `svchost.exe` and `sppsvc.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY` are expected, given their roles in system operations. However, the inclusion of logging utility processes running as SYSTEM could indicate deeper system access than typical.

### Assessment:
- While the logs reflect some typical utility and administrative scripting activity, certain anomalies stand out, particularly:
  - The use of `pnputil.exe` for driver management without clear context is suspicious, especially if unaccounted for.
  - Time manipulation can be a flag for attempts to cover tracks relating to changes or activities done under different times, hindering accurate log investigations.
  
These points highlight potential malicious activities, especially time manipulation and unknown driver additions, which are often not performed by regular users without administrative privileges and an explicit purpose.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities, especially around driver management and time settings changes, warrant a deeper investigation. This activity might indicate initial stages of compromise or lateral movement preparation. It is advisable to audit user activities, validate the legitimacy and need for the driver additions, and ensure system time changes were procedurally justified.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Conduct a thorough review of active sessions and examine any correlated network activity.
- Verify if the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` was conducting legitimate tasks that align with their role.
- Check system integrity and corroborate any changes with approved maintenance records.
- Implement tighter logging and alerting mechanisms for similar activities in the future."
Named pipe client impersonation,"After thoroughly examining the provided Windows event logs, here are my findings and assessment of potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Script:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a PowerShell script using `IEX (Invoke-Expression)` which downloads and executes content from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/script.ps1`). This script name suggests privilege escalation techniques were potentially being run.
   - PowerShell commands utilizing `IEX` and `IWR (Invoke-WebRequest)` to directly execute scripts from external sources are a hallmark of potential exploitation or malware activities. This behavior is abnormal for legitimate administrative tasks.

2. **Privileges Escalation (Security Logs):**
   - A user with the username `admin_test` was involved in privileged logon events (`4672`) granting extended rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These privileges are sensitive and might be exploited to gain unauthorized control over the system.

3. **Frequent Use of Local Network Tools (Sysmon Logs):**
   - There is a recurrent use of local binaries such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in logs; although they are legitimate, excessive invocation could point to log clearing or manipulation actions.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` execution under same session id show a potential enumeration activity which might suggest reconnaissance often associated with lateral movement or privilege collection.

4. **Time Modification (System Logs):**
   - There are logs (`Kernel-General 1`) indicating alterations of the system time, possibly to disrupt log timelines or impede incident detection efforts which can be a tactic used in system obfuscation.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
The PowerShell events directly reference the execution of an external script potentially designed for privilege escalation. Combined with the presence of elevated privileges and suspicious script execution methods, this indicates potential compromise:

- **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
  - PowerShell scripts executed with command arguments aimed at privilege escalation.
  - Privilege escalation detected through system events, indicating unauthorized or suspicious privilege use.
  - External script execution from an unverified source directly involving network retrieval functions.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious actions or spread within the internal network.
   - Block network access to known malicious domains or IPs related to the identified script source.

2. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on the affected system to identify any additional malicious files or changes.
   - Reset credentials for affected accounts and assess the need to patch vulnerabilities that allowed the execution of scripts.
   - Review and enhance network and endpoint security measures, including egress traffic monitoring and PowerShell script logging.

3. **Long-Term Solutions:**
   - Implement more stringent application whitelisting policies to prevent unauthorized scripts from running.
   - Train relevant personnel to quickly identify and respond to such privilege anomalies or suspicious administrative tool usage.

Ensure to document all findings and actions for post-incident review and adjust security measures accordingly to prevent similar future incidents."
RunPE via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell log, Sysmon log)**
    - The PowerShell logs reveal a predetermined script execution using `IEX` and `Invoke-script` commands.
    - The script is being fetched from an external source (""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"") which is a classic indicator of PowerShell abuse for malicious activities.
    - Execution context includes using potentially high privilege `SYSTEM` or elevated privileges, with related child processes (`conhost.exe`) observed in Sysmon logs.
  
2. **Unusual Process Execution (Sysmon log)**
    - The frequent creation of `wevtutil.exe` processes in batches possibly indicates attempts to interact with event logs, likely hiding traces or extracting logs, an activity characteristic of evasive maneuvers or malicious intentions.

3. **Potential Credential Access Attempts (Security log)**
    - Event ID `5379` lists credential access operations returning a code `3221226021`, indicating status codes related to failure, potentially unauthorized access attempts on `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and related services.
  
4. **Privilege Use (Security log)**
    - `4672` Events show privileges being assigned which include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, frequently abused by malware to gain further access or control over a system.
   
5. **Redundant SYSTEM Logons (Security log)**
    - Multiple redundant logons as `SYSTEM` with LogonType `5` (Service), seemingly procedural, might require correlation with security policies or monitoring service behavior.
  
#### Assessment of Malicious Activity

Given the analyses above, there are strong indicators pointing towards malicious activities:
- External script execution via PowerShell fetching potentially unauthorized scripts.
- Frequent creation of processes that interact with system event logs suggest possible attempts at log alteration or forensic evasion.
- Attempts at accessing sensitive account credentials, combined with elevated privilege operations around the same timeframe, push these activities beyond mere anomalies.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Potential Network Breach:** The execution of external scripts can lead to system compromise, access to confidential information or lateral movement within the network.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Usage of advanced privileges indicates a risk of misused administrative capabilities.
- **Data Exfiltration or Log Tampering:** The frequent manipulation of `wevtutil.exe` suggests a risk of either data exfiltration or cleaning logs to cover malicious tracks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected machine to prevent further damage or information leakage.
- **Deep Dive Investigation:** Investigate the source of the PowerShell script and its effects on the system.
- **Review Privileged Accounts:** Ensure all privileged accounts are reviewed for any unauthorized changes or usage.
- **Improve Monitoring:** Enhance logging and monitoring for better visibility into such activities, including anomaly detection.
  
### Final Resolution
The logs provided indicate clear signs of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Reg Key RunOnce,"Certainly, let's go through the logs to identify any suspicious or malicious activity:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - `EventID 4616` indicates system time changes. This is noteworthy because time manipulation can be used by attackers to alter the timestamps of their activities, making detection more difficult. The time was rolled back from 15:16:39 to 15:16:34. This was performed by `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes without clear reason should be investigated further.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation (EventID 1):** The process `whoami.exe` was executed multiple times from `C:\Windows\System32\`. While `whoami.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, unnecessary invocation, particularly with elevated privileges, can be suspicious.
   - `cmd.exe` was used to add a registry key (`REG ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d ""C:\Path\file.dll""`) indicating a persistence mechanism. Writing to the `RunOnceEx` registry key for an `admin_test` user is suspicious and indicates an attempt for persistence.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution: `wevtutil` is generally used for event log management which can include activities such as clearing event logs. This may signal an attempt to cover tracks.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are repeatedly run but without immediate context-related deviations, this alone does not imply malicious activity but is indicative of regular software update behavior.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - `Service stopped` events related to `edgeupdate`. While suspicious in the context of other activities could hint at an external process potentially interrupting legitimate services to perform unauthorized actions.

4. **System Logs:**
   - These primarily reinforce the observation of time changes as logged by the Kernel and Time services.

### Summary and Assessment:

The logs show several indicators of potentially suspicious activity:
- Unauthorised system time manipulation is a red flag, likely aiming to destabilize or confuse logging mechanisms.
- Registry modifications associated with DLL paths via `cmd.exe` strongly indicate attempts at persistence, typical for malware behavior.
- Repeated execution of system enumeration tools and event logs manipulations (via `wevtutil.exe`) potentially demonstrate attempts to obscure operations or ascertain system details while avoiding detection.

### Resolution:

Based on the evidence, particularly the unauthorized registry modification and potential tampering with logging mechanisms, I would classify this event as **MALICIOUS** due to clear signs of compromise and possible persistence mechanisms in place.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation:** Further detailed log examination and timeline assessment of previous days for anomalies.
2. **Endpoint Isolation:** Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further lateral movement.
3. **Comprehensive Malware Scanning:** Conduct thorough anti-malware scans.
4. **Review and Restore Time Settings:** Ensure that system time is correctly synchronized with NTP servers.
5. **System Recovery and Patch Management:** Consider reverting to a trusted image if contamination is confirmed and assure all systems are updated.
6. **Audit and Reinforce Security Posture:** Review user privileges and audit logs for peculiar actions across the network. Enhance monitoring to prevent recurrence."
EXO - Full access mailbox permission granted to a user,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, the following points stand out:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are several PowerShell events where Exchange management modules are being imported, and credentials are being converted to secure strings. The specific script executed:
     - Imports `ExchangeOnlineManagement`.
     - Converts a plaintext password to a secure string.
     - Creates a PowerShell credential object using `o365_user_test@contoso.com`.
     - Connects to Exchange Online with these credentials.
     - Adds mailbox permissions for `delegate@contoso.com` to `operator@contoso.com`.
     - Disconnects from Exchange Online.
   - The use of plain text password conversion is concerning if not part of a known administrative task.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The actions of `wevtutil.exe` can indicate log management or clearing activity, which may be suspicious depending on the context.
   - The frequent invocation of command-line utilities like `hostname` and `whoami` alongside PowerShell suggests investigation/reconnaissance activity by an admin user or scripted actions.

3. **Account and Privilege Usage:**
   - Logon sessions and process integrity levels are consistently high, suggesting usage by privileged accounts.
   - Actions performed involve administrative tasks like mailbox delegation, which, without sufficient context, can be either legitimate operations or potentially malicious if carried out without proper authorization.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The actions suggest possible unauthorized account manipulation within Exchange Online. Importing Exchange modules and handling credentials in PowerShell should be monitored, especially in a high-profile machine, like that of the CEO.
  
- **Suspicious Log Operations:** Use of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate a potential cover-up by clearing or modifying event logs.

- **Reconnaissance Activity:** Using utilities like `whoami` for gathering system/user information can be a sign of preparatory steps for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Recommendation:**

Due to these observations, the activity in the logs should be classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is recommended to determine:
- The legitimacy of the tasks performed by reviewing who authorized these operations.
- Secure the involved accounts by ensuring multi-factor authentication and reviewing delegation permissions changes.
- Inspect whether the `wevtutil.exe` executions were authorized or part of a script with legitimate intentions.
- Analyze historical logs and configurations to see if this behavior was present earlier and whether it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks or anomalous behavior.

- Immediate response actions could include restricting access to critical systems, notifying the involved parties, and possibly isolating the machine for further forensic investigation.

"
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW and CreatePipe WinAPIs,"Based on the provided logs, let's break down the analysis into potential indicators of suspicious activity and whether they point to benign, suspicious, or malicious activity.

### Detailed Log Analysis

1. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - **wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe Execution**:
     - **Multiple Instances**: We see repeated execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - **Context**: These tools are legitimate Windows utilities used for event log management and command prompt hosting, respectively. However, frequent usage could suggest log tampering or anomaly, depending on the command line and context of execution, which isn't apparent here.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Unclear Purpose**:
   - **Suspicious Command Line**: There is a PowerShell execution with the command: `powershell.exe` related to a temporary file location and an unknown executable `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` inside a path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\x64\CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` running `werfault.exe` with a `-debug` flag.
   - **Tool Execution**: The use of `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` might be seen as a technique often used for debugging or exploit purposes, given its unconventional path and combination with PowerShell.

3. **Time Change Event**:
   - **Timestamp Manipulation**: Detected a system time rollback from `18:41:52` to `18:41:26` initiated by `svchost.exe`. This could be a result of NTP or system time synchronization issues, or it could be malicious if used to evade timestamp checks in logs.

4. **Use of Whoami and Hostname**:
   - **Commands like whoami.exe and hostname.exe** are used for gathering user and system details. Multiple usages could indicate scrutiny of the system environment by an interactive user or automated script.

5. **Dumping Event Logs**:
   - **Command `wevtutil epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational...`**: Indicates possible dumping of event logs, potentially suspicious if not expected or sanctioned. Could be used for either legitimate archiving or attempting to clear traces.

### Conclusion and Assessment

Given the context of the provided logs, the following points lead to a resolution of **SUSPICIOUS**:

- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executions could denote log management but also potential tampering if unexpectedly frequent or unsanctioned.
- The execution of `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` alongside PowerShell and `werfault.exe -debug` indicates potentially malicious activity aimed at unauthorized debugging or exploitation but requires further investigation.
- The timestamp rollback, while sometimes conducted for legitimate reasons, raises suspicion in context with other findings.

### Recommendation

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the context of `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe`. Validate the filename, location, and its necessity for legitimate purposes.
   - Check user activity, especially `SERVER002\admin_test`, for abnormal behaviors or recently noticed issues.
   - Ensure the timing and frequency of log exports using `wevtutil` align with authorized administrative activities.
   
2. **Further Analysis**:
   - Audit accounts for unauthorized access or privilege escalations.
   - Monitor network communications for any signs of data exfiltration attempts due to possible PowerShell script actions.

3. **Conduct Forensics**:
   - Gather more evidence, including potential malicious payloads in temp directories, or other logs indicative of compromise.
   - Evaluate user and service accounts for unusual login behaviors or access patterns.

The findings warrant thorough investigation to affirm whether the activities are benign or point towards compromise. Proceed with caution, assume potential threat until proven otherwise, and keep monitoring for further signs of malicious intent."
Service Installation CMD,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several activities stand out for further investigation. Let's analyze the key findings:

1. **Service Creation and Execution:**
   - A service named `fileTestService_CMD` was created and started, as seen in the `cmd.exe` process execution:
     - **Command:** `""cmd.exe"" /c sc.exe create fileTestService_CMD binPath= ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\fileService.exe"" start=auto type=Own & sc.exe start fileTestService_CMD`
     - **File Path:** `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\fileService.exe`
   - This service was created to auto-start and operate under the `LocalSystem` account, as shown in the System log `EventID 7045`, which raises security concerns due to its persistence and high privilege level.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - `powershell.exe` was run by a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The execution of PowerShell without a clear motive could indicate preparation for further actions but does not directly tie to compromise without specific scripts or commands being executed.
   - `wevtutil.exe`, the Windows Event Utility, shows multiple executions by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Frequent execution within milliseconds suggests potential review or clearing of event logs, which can be considered suspicious if attempting to cover tracks.
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` executions might be part of regular administrative tasks, often used to gather system and user information.

3. **Command-line and Process Creation:**
   - The command-line executed by `cmd.exe` involved creating a service with `sc.exe`, which is a standard Windows utility for service control. While `sc.exe` executions can be benign, in this case, its usage in installing and starting a service from a temporary directory is highly suspect.
   - There was no clear indicator of typical post-compromise behavior like invoking malicious scripts or data exfiltration in described log snippets. However, the nature and initiation of the service are concerning.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` processes are observed performing update tasks. While generally normal, these updates are not immediately concerning without further abnormal command patterns.
   
### Assessment

Considering the above observations, elements of the logs suggest actions that align with potential malicious activity indicators:
- **Service Creation:** Execution of `fileService.exe` from a temporary directory, disguised as a service, poses a significant risk of persistence and privilege escalation.
- **Log Utility Usage:** Multiple rapid executions of `wevtutil.exe` might point towards tampering or clearing event logs.

### Conclusion and Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The evidence suggests suspicious activity, particularly focused around the unusual execution of a service from a temporary directory with high privileges by potentially unauthorized use of commands. The `wevtutil.exe` usage pattern hints at potential obfuscation activities.

### Guidance to Proceed
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a detailed analysis of the `fileService.exe` binary to confirm its purpose and origin.
   - Analyze the command history for `admin_test` to determine the intent behind the suspicious events.
   - Review related network activity logs near the timestamps for possible exfiltration or command and control communication.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable and remove the suspicious service `fileTestService_CMD`.
   - Change passwords and investigate any unauthorized access to `SERVER002\\admin_test` accounts.
   - Monitor `Server002` for any continued activity indicative of compromise.

3. **Recommendation:**
   - Increase monitoring on systems showing similar patterns and implement additional logging for persistence techniques.
   - Consider isolating affected systems until a thorough investigation is concluded."
Process Hollowing using PowerShell,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made pointing towards potential malicious activity on the CEO's machine (Server002). The following points summarize the notable activities observed:

1. **Privilege Escalation and Suspicious Privileges**:
   - Multiple `4672` events indicate that an account (admin_test) acquired highly sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which are not typically used in normal operations and can be exploited for malicious purposes.

2. **Logs Corresponding to the Execution of Suspicious Scripts**:
   - The `Sysmon` and `Windows PowerShell` logs reveal the execution of a PowerShell script called `Start-Hollow.ps1` from a temporary directory. The script uses a technique known as process hollowing (`Notepad.exe` as the sponsor and `cmd.exe` as the hollowing target), a common tactic used by malware to execute code within the address space of another process to evade detection.

3. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in quick succession in the `Sysmon` logs at the exact same time (`2024-10-22 18:30:03`) suggests that these processes are being used in a potentially suspicious manner, which might be part of an obfuscation or persistence strategy, especially since `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear event logs.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Processes such as `powershell.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed at a high integrity level under the `admin_test` account. This level of privilege could allow significant changes to be made to the system, typically not seen in standard user behavior.

5. **Use of NT AUTHORITY Accounts**:
   - The appearance of processes such as `svchost.exe` from `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is typical; however, when seen in conjunction with the above activities, it could be a sign of process manipulation or misuse.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The combination of sensitive privileges, suspicious PowerShell activity, execution of potential process-hollowing techniques, and abuse of system tools and accounts strongly suggest that there is an active threat on the system. The observed behaviors are consistent with known attack vectors and malware techniques.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Perform a deep forensic analysis to uncover potential payloads and attack vectors on the system.
3. **Privilege Review**: Audit active directory and local user privileges, especially those acquired by the `admin_test` account.
4. **Log Analysis**: Analyze additional logs for lateral movement and other compromises in the network.
5. **Patch and Mitigation**: Ensure that the system and software are up to date with the latest patches, and review system configurations for potential weaknesses or misconfigurations.
6. **User Awareness and Training**: Educate users about phishing and malicious scripts techniques, as these are common vectors for such attacks.

By taking immediate and thorough actions, you can mitigate the threat and secure the network environment."
Remote Process Injection with Go using RtlCreateUserThread WinAPI,"### Detailed Analysis

#### System Logs
- **Time Change Events:** 
  - There are two EventID `1` occurrences from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` indicating a change in the system time. The `NewTime` is set to a slightly older time which could be a method to hide certain activities within a specific time window. The process responsible is `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`.
  - Time synchronization events from the Time Service (`EventID 35`) indicate a normal synchronization with `time.windows.com`. 

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **PowerShell Script Execution:**
  - There is execution of a PowerShell script creating a process using `werfault.exe` and launching `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` from a temporary directory. This behavior is suspicious because `werfault.exe` is typically used for Windows error reporting and should not be launching custom executables from temporary directories. The use of `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` suggests possible malware as it is often used in advanced attacks to create threads within a process.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Command Execution:**
  - A series of `whoami.exe` and other system utilities being executed under the `admin_test` account. The commands like `whoami.exe` are often used by attackers post-compromise to gather information about the compromised user permissions and access rights.
  - The frequent execution of `conhost.exe` with high integrity level, especially after the usage of tools like `whoami.exe`, may indicate attempts to elevate privileges or maintain a stable presence.

#### Security Logs
- **Privilege Escalation:**
  - `EventID 4672` shows special privileges being assigned to the `admin_test` user. This includes significant privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used by attackers to tamper with other processes or escalate privileges.

### Assessment

**Suspicious Behavior Identified:**
- **Abnormal Time Changes:** While the time corrections might be a part of a routine adjustment, the discrepancy and frequency could mean tampering to evade detection.
- **PowerShell Execution:** The execution of non-standard processes via PowerShell, especially from a temporary directory, suggest an attempt at execution of a possible malicious payload.
- **Privelege Escalations:** Assignment of advanced privileges without clear justification could imply an attempt to maintain or escalate control over the system.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis, the logs reflect potentially malicious activity due to:
1. Unusual time changes that could be covering tracks.
2. Execution of a non-standard command sequence in PowerShell indicating possible malware execution.
3. Assignment of high-level privileges suggesting possible privilege escalation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Isolate the affected host:** Prevent further network communication and potential spread.
2. **Perform a full malware scan:** Use reputed anti-malware tools to identify any malicious software.
3. **Investigate User Actions:** Examine the `admin_test` account for unauthorized changes.
4. **Review PowerShell Scripts:** Collect and analyze the script contents executed recently on the host.
5. **Audit and Monitor:** Increase monitoring on affected systems and ensure audit logs are closely reviewed.
6. **Apply Patches:** Ensure the system is updated with the latest security patches and updates.

Immediate corrective actions must be taken to mitigate the risk and secure the environment."
Portable Executable Injection,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out, indicating potential malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Privilege Escalation and Logon Events:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that a user `admin_test` is assigned numerous high privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeLoadDriverPrivilege, and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege shortly after logging in. These privileges are often used in malicious contexts to escalate privileges and gain further control over the system.
   - Event ID 4624 shows that the `admin_test` user logged on from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. The combination of high privileges and logon type 3 (network logon) could suggest potential lateral movement in the network.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that runs `RedInjection.exe` from a temporary directory and attempts to kill the Notepad process. The execution of files from temporary directories and the use of process termination commands is typical in malware behavior, often used for persistence or evasion.
   - The specific PowerShell script `powershell.exe & {Start-Process ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\RedInjection.exe""...}` uses Start-Sleep and Stop-Process cmdlets, which may be used maliciously to delay the execution of a process and forcefully stop another application.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Process Creation:**
   - There are logs of Sysmon Event ID 1 for the execution of `RedInjection.exe`, again highlighting suspicious activity. The execution is started by PowerShell, which aligns with known tactics used by attackers to run malicious payloads.
   - There are also multiple instances of `conhost.exe` being initiated with a `-ForceV1` argument which can be indicative of anomalous behavior, often seen in attempts to mask malicious operations.

4. **Background Updates:**
   - Regular update activities of Microsoft Edge Update service (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and its associated processes (`setup.exe`) appear normal as they follow typical update patterns and use NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
The evidence points to potentially malicious activity due to the combination of privilege escalation, use of PowerShell for executing executables from non-standard directories, and suspicious behavior related to process management. The presence of `RedInjection.exe` is particularly concerning as it suggests possible injection attacks or a payload delivery.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS.**

**Guidance:**
1. Restrict and audit the privileges of the `admin_test` user immediately.
2. Inspect and remove any identified malicious files (e.g., `RedInjection.exe`) and investigate further for other potential backdoors.
3. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the affected machine to identify other signs of compromise.
4. Monitor the network for any unusual authentication requests or data exfiltration activities.
5. Review and strengthen endpoint detection response (EDR) solutions to capture and mitigate such threats in the future."
Domain Account and Group Manipulate,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

Reviewing the provided logs, there are several instances of behavior that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with the command line including a sequence that creates a potentially unauthorized user account and adds it to the ""Domain Admins"" group using `New-ADUser` and `Add-ADGroupMember` commands.
   - The command generates a random username and executes modifications to Active Directory, indicating an attempt to escalate privileges or alter domain configuration.
   - This kind of activity is highly suspicious as it suggests an attempt to establish persistent, elevated access within the domain environment.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user, which commonly could be used to clear event logs or handle unusual console operations, respectively. However, without further context, the number and pattern of execution are more indicative of automation or script-driven activity rather than direct manual interventions.
   - Similarly, there is usage of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `WindowsPowerShell.exe`, which are not inherently suspicious but could be indicative of reconnaissance or situational awareness tasks conducted by an intruder.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The operations are executed under a high integrity level, suggesting privileged access.
   - The presence of privileged processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` and the spawning of PowerShell processes can indicate an attempt to manage the system remotely via PowerShell remoting capabilities, permitting an attacker to operate with elevated permissions.

4. **Unauthorized Credential Management and Group Membership Changes:**
   - The use of Active Directory cmdlets within the observed PowerShell command reflects an attempt to manage credentials and group memberships, which, if unauthorized, is a serious security concern.
   - Observed in the Security logs with Event ID 4798 indicates potential enumeration of user account information which aligns with reconnaissance activity typically seen during unauthorized access attempts.

5. **General System Processes:**
   - While several invoked processes (`svchost.exe`, `sc.exe`) appear routine, the context of their execution, and their linkage to other suspicious actions strengthens the concern over abnormal system behavior.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

Based on the logs provided, there is strong evidence of malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to create a new user account and add it to a privileged group without apparent authorization constitutes clear evidence of a breach involving privilege escalation tactics.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration by the threat actor.
2. **User Account Review:** Immediately review and disable the unauthorized user accounts created (`atr--$x$y$z`) and any other suspicious accounts.
3. **Password Changes:** Enforce a password change for all administrators and review recent sessions for any unauthorized access patterns.
4. **Comprehensive Sweep:** Conduct a full investigation into other systems within the network to check for lateral movement or additional compromised endpoints.
5. **Log Review and Retention:** Ensure logs are reviewed regularly for signs of similar activities. Enhance logging configurations if necessary to capture full command-line executions and PowerShell script contents.
6. **Update Security Measures:** Ensure that security policies for PowerShell script execution and other elevated permissions are strict and enforced across all endpoints.
7. **Incident Notification:** Notify and engage your Incident Response team and potentially law enforcement, depending on the severity and scope of the breach.
8. **User Education:** Reiterate security training, focusing on the risks posed by unauthorized tool use and encouraging vigilance."
UUID custom process Injection,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest have emerged that suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs reveal execution of a script involving `uuid_injection.exe` located in a temporary directory, which includes commands to forcefully stop Notepad processes. The script also uses the `Start-Process` cmdlet to launch an executable from a non-standard directory, often associated with malicious use (either directly executing malware or part of a staged attack).
   - Another PowerShell command sequence shows `Add-Type` to load an assembly followed by displaying a message box and starting Notepad. This can be used by attackers trying to execute or hide additional actions within legitimate-looking processes.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs confirm execution of `uuid_injection.exe`, which further solidifies concerns about this being a potentially malicious operation, as it appears alongside legitimate system tools, suggesting privilege abuse or masquerading attempts. 
   - Compounded with an occurrence of `conhost.exe` processes being spawned by other processes (a known technique for obfuscation and evasion in attacks), these signs point to potentially abnormal activity.

3. **Security and Application Logs**:
   - There is consistent logging of SYSTEM account activity, which is not unusual in itself but needs to be juxtaposed with the PowerShell and Sysmon events.
   - Logon events (ID 4624) and privilege assignments (ID 4672) for SYSTEM align with the PowerShell operations' timing, suggesting these processes possibly performed with elevated privileges.

### Assessment and Resolution:
The aggregation of unusual process executions, particularly involving suspicious scripts and executables within temporary directories, is indicative of potentially malicious behavior. The recurring use of non-standard PowerShell commands to execute or suppress system processes typically indicates unauthorized or malicious attempts to control the system.

Given the combination of elements like execution of suspicious binaries, PowerShell script activity from non-standard locations, and the potential for privilege misuse, the overall behavior strongly hints at malicious activity. While some logs may not independently confirm malicious intent, the pattern and context lead to a concerning inference.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance for Further Action:
- **Immediate Isolation of the Host**: Disconnect the infected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement and contain potential threats.
- **In-Depth Forensic Analysis**: Conduct detailed forensic examination to trace back the origin and impact of `uuid_injection.exe` and associated PowerShell activities.
- **Malware Scanning**: Use advanced threat protection tools to scan for potential malware, considering particular focus on files in temporary directories.
- **Review User Activities and Permissions**: Investigate any unusual user or administrative account access around the times of the highlighted activities and adjust accounts to minimal privileges where necessary.
- **Implement Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on similar activities across the network to avert future incidents, including PowerShell logging and unusual script executions.

Understanding the full scope, aiming for comprehensive remediation steps, and post-event analysis to refine security posture will be crucial following these findings."
Azure AD - adding service principal to Azure AD role,"Upon reviewing the logs, several activities and patterns emerge that require careful consideration:

1. **PowerShell Activities**: The logs show multiple instances of PowerShell execution. In particular, there is a script that uses PowerShell to connect to Azure AD using a specified username (""jonh@contoso.com"") and plaintext password. It attempts to find a service principal ('SuperSP') and then add this principal to a role ('Global Reader'). Such activity of credential management and privilege assignment using PowerShell can be indicative of potential abuse or unauthorized access without additional context or notification from administrators.

2. **Usage of System Utilities**: The logs show frequent creation of processes such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`. The execution of these system applications could be part of normal administrative operations. However, without legitimate administrative actions to corroborate, this can be suspicious especially combined with repeated PowerShell commands.

3. **Abnormal Behavior Indicators**: 
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used to manage and clear event logs; this might indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests reconnaissance activity (identifying what user the action is executing as and the system’s hostname).

4. **Windows Update Entries**: The system log entries associated with Windows Update do not inherently suggest malicious activity, as they detail standard updates.

Assessment and Resolution:
- **Indicators of Suspicion**: The command-line operations involving sensitive information and potential alteration of roles in Azure AD without clear authorization mechanisms raise suspicion. The combination of using PowerShell for credential operations and potential log manipulation tools like `wevtutil.exe` strongly suggests activities that could align with an attempt to access or modify privileged capability inappropriately or cover tracks.
  
- **Conclusion**: Given the potentially unauthorized credential handling and privilege modification attempt along with suspicious use of system tools, the activities observed should not be deemed immediately benign. These elements align more with reconnaissance and potential privilege escalation.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Initiate a thorough review of user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" activities, permissions, and any anomalous access patterns.
- Validate with Azure AD administration if the mentioned script execution was authorized, and ensure such access is logged and follows organizational policy.
- Conduct a deeper investigation to trace the PowerShell activities' origin - validate if it was scheduled, manually executed, or if there were network activities aligning to it.
- Ensure monitoring and alerting are properly configured for PowerShell script executions and abnormal activity on high-privilege accounts.
- Consider implementing Just Enough Administration (JEA) for sensitive account operations to reduce excess administrative rights."
Domain Password Policy Check: Only Two Character Classes,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, a few key areas warrant detailed examination to assess potential threats or malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple logs indicate a PowerShell script was executed, which attempted to change the user's password using stored credentials. The process repeatedly checks the password stored in a local file against a hardcoded value (""onlyUPandLowChars"") and attempts to update it using `Set-ADAccountPassword`. Additionally, the script captures exceptions, particularly focusing on error codes, and handles credential storage and removal operations.
   - The use of PowerShell to manipulate Active Directory accounts, along with storing passwords in files, is a suspicious behavior and potentially indicative of an attempt at lateral movement or privilege escalation by a malicious actor.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and Console Host (`conhost.exe`) executions by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" are documented, including process creation logs with commands linked to potential password changes.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` (event utility) processes may indicate attempts to clear event logs, which could be an effort to cover tracks.
   - The pattern of executing PowerShell scripts and other executable files (like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`) can be interpreted as reconnaissance or an attempt to maintain persistence on the network.

3. **Security Events:**
   - Event 4798, ""A user's local group membership was enumerated,"" appeared multiple times. This could suggest reconnaissance activities to enumerate user privileges, potentially probing for privilege escalation opportunities.
   - Event 4672, ""Special privileges assigned to new logon,"" appeared repeatedly, indicating a logon session was assigned high-level privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, typical in elevated access situations for potentially sensitive operations.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

- The use of PowerShell scripts in such a manner, combined with credential manipulation and extensive process creation activities through both `wevtutil` and other command-line utilities, suggests a coordinated attempt to perform unauthorized actions on the system.
- The behavior of gathering credential information, modifying it, and handling potential errors indicates a premeditated effort characteristic of malicious activity, possibly indicating a compromised account or insider threat.

### Guidance and Resolution:

Given the logs analyzed and the nature of the activities observed, it is recommended to escalate the investigation due to:

- The appearance of process manipulation involving credentials.
- Potentially malicious use of PowerShell for password changes.
- Attempts to enumerate user group memberships and clear logs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Suggested Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Terminate all suspicious PowerShell sessions.
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the affected systems to determine the scope of the intrusion.
   - Review and validate any user accounts involved in these activities, focusing on ""admin_test.""

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset all potentially compromised user credentials and ensure enhanced monitoring is in place.
   - Implement strict PowerShell script execution policies and logging.
   
4. **Notification:**
   - Alert relevant stakeholders, including IT management and security teams, on the situation for coordinated response efforts. 

These steps should help mitigate any further risks while identifying and addressing the root cause of the intrusion."
PowerShell Registry RunOnce,"Upon review, there are several indicators of potential malicious activity within the provided logs that warrant a detailed analysis. Let's break down the findings:

### Analysis

**1. Privileged Logon Sessions:**
   - Event ID 4672: The user `admin_test` was granted a series of high-level privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, and others. These are typically granted to administrators and can be used to manipulate system processes for malicious intent.

**2. NTLM Logons:**
   - Event ID 4624: The logon type 3 (network logon) is observed from a suspicious address using NTLM authentication, which isn't inherently malicious but raises questions especially if not typical behavior for `admin_test`.

**3. Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** There are multiple instances where `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are being executed. While these are typically benign, they can be part of a reconnaissance or log manipulation effort when used in conjunction with suspicious activity.
  
**4. Abuse of PowerShell:**
   - **Sysmon Event and Windows PowerShell logs:** A PowerShell process executed a command designed to download and execute a script from a URL: `https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/src/Discovery.bat`. This is a clear red flag, as hosted scripts could be malicious.

**5. Scheduled Tasks or Persistence Mechanism:**
   - PowerShell logs indicate manipulation of the `RunOnce` registry key to execute the script post-reboot, which is typical of persistence strategies used by malware.

### Conclusion

The activity observed in the logs, particularly the PowerShell execution of an external script and the registry modifications, are strong indicators of a potential security compromise. The combination of privileged logon sessions, process creations indicative of potential reconnaissance or anti-forensic behavior, and the unauthorized PowerShell command execution all point toward malicious activity.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Isolate the System:**
   - Disconnect the machine from the network immediately to prevent any further command-and-control activities or data exfiltration.

2. **Conduct a Full Security Audit:**
   - Perform a thorough audit of the system to identify additional signs of compromise and other affected systems.

3. **Analyze Network Traffic:**
   - Investigate any network connections initiated by the machine, especially around the timestamps of the suspicious activities, to trace potential data leaks or command-and-control channels.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement more robust logging and monitoring solutions to detect similar suspicious activities in the future.

5. **Patch and Remediate:**
   - Ensure all systems are patched and up-to-date to mitigate exploitation through known vulnerabilities. Remove unauthorized registry entries.

6. **Educate Users:**
   - Conduct training for all users, especially those with administrative access, to recognize and report suspicious activity. 

The logs point towards an ongoing security incident. Immediate remedial actions are critical to minimize potential damage."
Modify BootExecute Value,"Based on the provided logs for investigation, several points of interest have been highlighted that could suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **Registry Backup and Modification**: 
    - The PowerShell command is attempting to export a registry key from ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager"" and then set a property called ""BootExecute"" to ""autocheck autoche *"". Although backing up registry keys is reasonable administrative behavior, the combination of this activity with registry modification can sometimes be used by malware to tamper with system boot configurations, especially in a scenario involving the CEO’s machine.
    - This could potentially lead to modification of boot-time behavior. It is suspicious, especially if there is no legitimate need for such a change.

#### Security Log:
2. **Time Change Events**:
    - Multiple events show the system time being changed, which may happen during normal synchronized time updates but should be validated with environment policies. Out-of-policy time changes could be used by attackers to cover tracks or manipulate time-stamped logs.

#### Sysmon Log:
3. **Processes and Child Process Relations**:
    - A sequence of process creations involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` does not directly indicate malicious action, but should be verified against expected administrative tasks.
    - Evidence of Microsoft Edge Update activities aligning with process installations and updates (`sppsvc.exe`, `reg.exe`, `conhost.exe`). These show signs of update services running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typically expected.
    - The PowerShell and `reg.exe` command indicators from logs suggest an attempt to potentially manipulate registry keys.

### Conclusion and Assessment:
The behavior recorded in the logs is suspicious due to the registry operations involving system management areas, particularly in association with exported registry backups and modified keys. However, the lack of clear malicious payloads or additional malicious indicators limits certainty.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
Given the suspicious nature of registry manipulations:

1. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Validate whether the registry changes have a legitimate purpose. Contact system administrators to verify if such changes were scheduled or known to them.
   - Check if there are additional logs or network traffic that might correlate with suspicious activity, such as unusual outgoing connections or further system changes.
   
2. **Analytical Steps**:
   - Query for any similar patterns on other critical assets to establish if this is an isolated incident.
   - Investigate the origin of the PowerShell scripts and command-line instructions; verify their origin and integrity.
   
3. **Recommendations**:
   - If unauthorized registry manipulations are confirmed, consider reinstating previous system states and strengthen monitoring around critical registry paths.
   - Enhance endpoint detection rules to detect unusually timed or unauthorized registry accesses.
   
4. **Secure System**:
   - Review user permissions for `admin_test` and assess if privilege escalation occurred.
   - Implement a script execution policy to prevent untrusted scripts from executing without specific approvals.

Overall, continue monitoring and engage security response protocols to ensure no further compromise propagates within the network."
Modify Fax service to run PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs, I have identified several points that require analysis:

1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Execution:**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` within a very short time frame, all started by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This could be suspicious as `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs and might indicate an attempt to clear logs or manage them for some purpose.

2. **Service Configuration and Execution via CMD:**
   - There is a command executed via `cmd.exe` to reconfigure the `Fax` service to execute a PowerShell script. The command seems to modify the service configuration using `sc config` and starts the service, which is atypical behavior for a non-administrator account.
   - The PowerShell command is `write-host 'data.003 Test'`, which seems benign but the method of executing it through service indicates possible abuse of a legitimate service for arbitrary command execution.

3. **PowerShell and SC Executions:**
   - PowerShell being executed with the ""-noexit"" option indicates a desire to keep the shell open after execution which could be used for interactive purposes.
   - The `sc.exe` command has been used to modify and start services via a script, which is typically an indicator of compromise since this method is often used for persistence in malicious activity.

4. **No Indicators of Actual Malicious Payload:**
   - Apart from unusual service reconfiguration and execution patterns, there do not seem to be any direct indicators (such as creating files in suspicious locations, network connections to malicious IPs, or known bad hashes) of a payload or compromise.

5. **High Privilege Use:**
   - Activities were conducted under high integrity levels, which raises concern considering the service manipulations.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Given the analysis of the provided logs, this activity seems highly suspicious due to:
- The use of service reconfiguration to execute PowerShell, indicative of a potentially malicious tactic for persistence.
- Abnormal patterns in the execution of system tools (`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`).

The situation could potentially indicate either a simulated attack/test activity on the system or an actual unauthorized intrusion. However, without more context or evidence of a malicious payload, it is not definitive of a breach but warrants further investigation. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Monitor for any additional abnormal behaviors.
- Investigate the source and legitimacy of the `CMD` scripts and service reconfiguration.
- Consider isolating the machine for a detailed forensic analysis to determine the motive and scope of this activity."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI (Natively),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations have been made concerning anomalous activities that suggest potential security risks:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

#### 1. **PowerShell Usage**:
- A PowerShell command is executed that starts `werfault.exe` and subsequently runs `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` with `-debug` flag attached to the target process's ID.
- `werfault.exe` is typically associated with Windows error reporting, and its usage here is unusual, especially in combination with `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`, which suggests an attempt to inject or execute code in another process. This behavior is indicative of process hollowing or DLL injection, which is a common technique used in exploits and for maintaining persistence.

#### 2. **Privilege Escalation and Elevated Rights**:
- The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` and other privileges like `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege` in the logs indicates an account with escalated permissions. This could potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code with system-level privileges or the manipulation of other system processes and resources.

#### 3. **Use of Native Windows Tools**:
- The execution of `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test` can be considered normal depending on the context; however, their timing in correlation with other anomalous activities can suggest reconnaissance or enumeration efforts by an adversary.
- `wevtutil.exe` is used to query event logs, and its execution by `admin_test` indicates log exploration, which could be to cover tracks or identify system weaknesses.

#### 4. **Time Discrepancies**:
- There's an adjustment in the system's time logged by `svchost.exe`. Changes in system time can be used to disrupt log integrity and timestamps, indicating potential tampering with time settings to evade detection mechanisms.

### Assessment:

The analysis of these logs points to suspicious behavior. Primarily, the unusual execution pattern involving PowerShell commands, exploitation of Windows process handling (like `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe`), and user `admin_test` leveraging wevtutil for querying suggests potential malicious activities.

### Identified Threats/Risks:
- **Code Injection**: The use of `CreateRemoteThreadNative.exe` ideally suggests code injection which is frequent among sophisticated attacks.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Utilization of privileged rights may indicate an attempt or successful privilege escalation.
- **Reconnaissance**: Executions of processes like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` coupled with admin-level access suggest suspicious exploration of system internals.
- **Potential Persistence Mechanisms**: Modified timestamps and PowerShell operations hint at potential persistence tactics.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected machine `Server002` to prevent further exploitation or data exfiltration.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Enhanced logging and monitoring for similar PowerShell activities and command executions on other hosts.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on `Server002` to confirm the presence and scope of any compromise.
4. **Review Access and Privileges**: Re-evaluate the privileges for the `admin_test` account and any other accounts which may have elevated access rights.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems and software are up-to-date with current security patches to mitigate any known vulnerabilities.
6. **Incident Response Plan Activation**: Engage broader incident response measures to safeguard assets and contain the potential threat.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs exhibit activities that necessitate further investigation to assure there is no active compromise."
Leverage Virtual Channels to execute custom DLL during successful RDP session,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, we need to identify any anomalies or suspicious activities indicative of potential malicious behavior. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Anomalous Behaviors Noted:

1. **Registry Modification:**
   - A sequence of events indicates the use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to add an entry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins\Malware`.
   - The command used is:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins\Malware"" /v Name /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f
     ```
   - This is a clear indicator of an attempt to modify the registry, potentially trying to add a malicious DLL as an add-in.

2. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of `Wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` executing in quick succession. While these processes are not inherently malicious, their frequent and clustered usage could indicate an attempt to gather information or manipulate event logs for evasion.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are run multiple times within a short timeframe, suggesting some form of scripted activity.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related activities are typical but extensively frequent updates and runs could be used as a potential cover for malicious activities.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Registry Manipulation:**
  - Modifying the registry to associate a DLL like `amsi.dll` under an add-ins key labeled ""Malware"" is strongly indicative of injecting a potentially malicious DLL.

- **Use of Legitimate Tools for Malicious Purposes:**
  - The frequent execution of legitimate tools like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` could be possibly used for process masquerading or conducting unauthorized activities under the guise of normal operations.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the logs:

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

The registry modification to load a possibly malicious DLL, combined with suspicious usage patterns of Windows utilities, indicates clear malicious activity aiming for persistence or unauthorized actions on the system.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - Revert any malicious registry changes particularly concerning `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default\Addins`.
   - Carefully assess the `amsi.dll` to ensure it hasn't been corrupted or altered.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for similar activities on other critical systems.
   - Consider deploying Sysmon or similar tools to log more detailed events for future analysis.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**

These steps aim to address the immediate threat and prevent future occurrences by strengthening system and network defenses."
HKLM - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

#### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, which can be legitimate but also a common target for attackers to clear logs.
   - `conhost.exe` is often associated with console applications and should typically not accompany `wevtutil.exe` in a burst of executions.
   - The user associated with these processes is `SERVER002\admin_test`. This user appears to have initiated multiple instances of these activities.

2. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` tools are typically used for basic network and user enumeration, which is normal unless repeated unnecessarily or in conjunction with other suspicious activities.
   - The processes executed cleanly with standard command lines.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - `powershell.exe` is used to create a registry key under `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run` and sets a value pointing to `C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe`. This behavior suggests persistence tactics, as it may set a program to run on startup, which is suspicious.
   - Command includes creating registry entries and is executed under a high integrity level, which adds to its suspicion.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Confirms the execution of the PowerShell script that modifies registry entries aimed toward persistence through startup programs.
- The script's nature indicates an attempt to maintain presence in the system through a slightly altered version of the startup scripts.

#### Security Logs:
- Several event IDs like `4624` (successful logon) and `4672` (privilege use) show administrative privileges associated with `admin_test`.
- There is a discontinuity or reset in time logs (event ID `4616` - system time change), which might indicate an attempt to cover tracks or confuse logging timestamps. 

### Assessment:
The activities outlined in the logs display potential indicators of compromise:
- **Anomalous Process Execution**: The repeated execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under administrative context suggests either maintenance scripts or malicious intent to manipulate system logs or settings without raising alarms.
- **Persistence Techniques**: The PowerShell command modifying registry to trigger `calc.exe` indicates a potential persistence mechanism which could be a test or a real attempt to maintain unauthorized system access.
- **Privilege Levels**: The consistent use of high privilege operations emphasizes the high potential risk of malicious actions.

### Conclusion:
Upon integrating the individual events:
- There is **suspicious** activity related to PowerShell scripting resembling persistence tactics.
- The suspicious execution patterns and the misuse of administrative privileges suggest that these actions are aligned more with attempts of compromise rather than legitimate administrative functions.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Further Investigation**: 
  - Investigate the intent and frequency of `admin_test` user activities on the system in conjunction with its network activities.
  - Review other system logs over a broader timeframe to assess any linked activities.
- **Immediate Action**:
  - Consider isolating the system for forensic analysis.
  - Check for unauthorized changes to the system's registry and scheduled tasks.
  - Update antivirus definitions and run comprehensive scans.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Implement enhanced monitoring on `admin_test` account and other administrative accounts for unusual patterns of login and command execution."
Snake Malware Kernel Driver Comadmin,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Event Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate multiple PowerShell invocations executing a script.
   - The command involves:
     - Checking for a path and creating a directory if it does not exist.
     - Generating random bytes and writing them to a file named `comadmin.dat` in the `system32\Com` directory.
   - **Suspicious Behavior**:
     - The script involves using PowerShell to write binary data into a system directory. This is unusual behavior for benign activities, especially on a high-profile user’s machine like the CEO's.
     - Creating directories and dropping files in `system32` could be an indicator of malicious activity aiming at persistence or preparation for privilege escalation.

#### Application Logs

1. **Edge Update Service Events**:
   - There are logs of `edgeupdate` service stopping.

Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process,"Analyzing the provided logs, there are several points that require attention:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Command Execution:**
  - The PowerShell logs indicate the use of `powershell.exe` with the command line `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`. This command suggests an attempt to start a process within the context of a specific parent process. The constructed command includes `Start-Sleep 10`.
  - The nature of this command indicates a level of obfuscation or an attempt to evade detection, as process injection or manipulation strategies are often employed by malicious actors to gain persistence or execute code silently.

### Sysmon Logs
- **PowerShell Process:**
  - Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `powershell.exe` with the suspicious command. This kind of process execution chain (`powershell.exe` spawning other critical processes) is often a tell-tale sign of a scripted attack or lateral movement technique, possibly leveraging PowerShell's capabilities for execution from memory.
- **Process Execution Context:**
  - The user observed executing these actions is `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting an administrative context which increases the risk of potential abuse.

### System and Security Logs
- **Admin Context:**
  - Security logs reveal elevated privileges (EventID 4672), with several critical privileges assigned like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., which are indicative of possible privilege escalation attempts.
- **Network and Services:**
  - A `SYSTEM` level process (`services.exe`) is associated with logon events. This could be routine but combined with elevated privileges, it warrants closer scrutiny.

### Application Logs and Windows Update Events
- **Regular Updates:**
  - The Windows Update events and Application logs show routine update checks and executions which appear normal and benign.

### Summary and Assessment
- **Observed Anomalies:**
  - The use of PowerShell in the context found in the logs—especially with commands like `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`—is concerning and indicative of abnormal, potentially malicious behavior.
  - The presence of administrative privileges in the context of script execution further corroborates the risk, suggesting possible execution policies that are manipulated to allow unintended code execution.

### Resolution
- **Resolution Status: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Based on the analysis, the logs show suspicious activity, particularly around the PowerShell executions and privilege assignments. The behavior is anomalous but does not, with absolute certainty, confirm malicious activity. However, the risk of potential compromise is significant enough to warrant a more detailed investigation.

### Guidance and Next Steps
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the purpose and origin of the PowerShell commands and scripts executed with `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`.
   - Verify if the user `admin_test` has valid, routine operations justifying such actions, or if these actions are unauthorized.
2. **Mitigation Steps:**
   - Monitor and possibly limit the execution of PowerShell scripts, especially with high privileges.
   - Implement stricter process auditing for `admin_test` and any administrative accounts.
3. **Review Logs:**
   - Continuously monitor the System and Security logs for any further signs of privilege escalation or unusual system behavior."
Access Token Manipulation,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are PowerShell events where `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force` is used, which is commonly associated with bypassing script execution policies for malicious reasons. This was followed by a script located in a temporary folder: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\src\GetToken.ps1`. Usage of temporary directories and setting execution policies to bypass are indicative of potential malicious activity.

2. **Processes Targeting LSASS:**
   - The PowerShell command script references `[MyProcess]::CreateProcessFromParent((Get-Process lsass).Id,""cmd.exe"")`, which raises a red flag as it indicates potential credential theft attempts by interacting with the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS), a known target for attackers to dump credentials.

3. **Console Host (conhost.exe) and Other Windows Utilities:**
   - Multiple executions of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` without clear legit context point towards potential misuse or automation scripts often used during attacks to enumerate or clean logs.
   
4. **Host and User Enumeration:**
   - The execution of utilities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` in quick succession implies user reconnaissance or environment enumeration, activities typically executed by attackers.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - The frequent and varied execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes could be legitimate edge servicing or propagation of updates; however, in the context of other activities observed, it would require further scrutiny.

Based on the above analysis, the activity within these logs shows characteristics of potential malicious behavior, primarily through the suspicious usage of PowerShell scripts targeting LSASS, which typically point towards credential theft attempts and privilege escalation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Quarantine the Affected Machine:** Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation:** Analyze memory dumps (specifically from LSASS) and network traffic to correlate any external contacts or data transfers.
- **Review User Activity:** Verify any unauthorized access to sensitive data or configurations by the `admin_test` account.
- **Update Security Policies:** Ensure that execution policies and script logging are configured to prevent future occurrences.

HKLM - Modify default System Shell - Winlogon Shell KEY Value,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Windows PowerShell Log
The PowerShell logs exhibit commands involving the manipulation of registry entries related to the Windows Shell. The PowerShell script executed is:
```powershell
$oldvalue = $(Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" -Name ""Shell"");
Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" -Name ""Shell-backup"" -Value ""$oldvalue"";
$newvalue = $oldvalue + "", C:\Windows\explorer.exe"";
Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" -Name ""Shell"" -Value ""$newvalue"";
```
**Analysis**:
- Manipulating the `Shell` registry key may alter the default shell configuration, which is often indicative of a persistence mechanism employed by malicious software. This action is particularly suspicious when the `explorer.exe` path is appended rather than set exclusively, suggesting potential tampering for dual execution.

### Sysmon Log
The Sysmon logs detail various process creation events. Notably:
- `powershell.exe` is executed with a suspicious command line indicating registry manipulation.
- Multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes and `conhost.exe` executions from the same user context, `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- System processes related to Windows and Microsoft Edge updates are shown, which appears routine.

### Security Log
- The `admin_test` account has been assigned various privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc.) indicating privileged operations, possibly for system manipulation or data extraction.
- A successful login event (`4624`) indicates the use of NTLM authentication, commonly associated with login or session creation activities.

### Application and System Logs
- Routine activity involving system software updates and services, indicating system maintenance tasks.

### Overall Assessment
The activity involving registry modifications, particularly to the critical `Winlogon` key, is highly suspect. This behavior aligns with tactics employed by malware to establish persistence. While some activities, like Microsoft Edge updates, appear benign, the direct manipulation of shell registry entries stands out as potentially malicious behavior.

### Resolution
Based on the evidence of registry tampering, likely for persistence, the situation is categorized as:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to assess any changes made to critical system configurations.
- Evaluate the integrity and authenticity of the `explorer.exe` file in `C:\Windows\`.
- Consider isolating the affected system to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.

- Employ a malware scan using up-to-date definitions to detect any known threats.
- Validate and restore the original registry settings if changes are unauthorized."
Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity were identified. Here is a detailed analysis and assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a PowerShell script execution involving `PPID-Spoof.ps1`. The script is set to run with parameters intended to spoof the Parent Process ID (PPID) and spawn another process (`iexplore.exe`) using a DLL (`calc.dll`). These activities are highly suspicious as they can be used in process injection attacks to hide the malicious activity and evade detection.

2. **User Account**: The actions are performed by the user account `admin_test`, which seems to be leveraging administrative privileges. The activities conducted by this account, especially in relation to executing potentially malicious scripts and tools, raise concerns about its legitimacy and intent.

3. **Execution of In-Built Tools**: The frequent invocation of utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and PowerShell may indicate attempts to manipulate logs, execute commands, and maintain persistence through living-off-the-land binaries. The usage pattern does not match typical system or application behavior.

4. **Privileges and Permissions**: There are several log entries (EventID 4672) indicating special privileges assigned to the `SYSTEM` account. This is expected in some administrative tasks; however, in tandem with the suspicious script execution, it implies a potential for abuse.

5. **Error Codes and Failed Credential Access**: Event IDs like 5379 indicate failed attempts to retrieve credentials or access other systems/resources, commonly associated with reconnaissance or lateral movement phases of an attack.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- The use of `PPID-Spoof.ps1`, a known technique to disguise processes and potentially inject malicious code, is a strong indicator of malicious activity.
- The spawning of Internet Explorer using a prespecified DLL (`calc.dll`) suggests code injection attempts and usage of benign applications to carry out malicious operations.

### Assessment
Based on the aforementioned findings, the activity recorded in the logs is characterized by known attack techniques, leveraging administrative privileges and native tools for potentially malicious purposes. This strongly suggests that the system or user account was utilized for nefarious activities.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- **User Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized use or compromise. Revoke suspicious privileges immediately.
- **Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team to conduct a thorough investigation, including memory and forensic analysis, to understand the extent and nature of this incident.
- **Monitor and Alerting**: Enhance security monitoring and alerts for suspicious activities similar to those identified in this analysis.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches to protect against known exploits and vulnerabilities."
At.exe Scheduled task,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity are observed:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4616 - System Time Changed:** 
   - The logs include multiple Event ID 4616, which signifies a system time change. This can be benign, as it could occur during normal time synchronization with NTP servers. However, repeated or unauthorized changes could be indicative of an attempt to manipulate file timestamps, which could be part of a cover-up method used by attackers.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Frequent Execution of System Binaries:**
   - A pattern of executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is observed. All these are legitimate Windows utilities but can be utilized maliciously, especially if executed in succession.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and its frequent execution can sometimes indicate log manipulation.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` provide system and user identity information, which may be leveraged by an attacker to understand the environment and acquired privileges.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `at 13:20 /interactive cmd` indicates a scheduled task creation, which is often used in persistence or privilege escalation attacks. Although `at.exe` command is deprecated, its presence is still a potential concern if misused for malicious purposes.

2. **Process Parents and Context:**
   - The execution of these processes with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, having a high integrity level, raises questions regarding this user's activity scope. The parent processes associated with these executions primarily include `wsmprovhost.exe`, a system process related to Windows Remote Management, which might indicate these commands were issued remotely or initiated through a remote management context.

3. **Utility `at.exe`:**
   - It is noted for creating a scheduled task to run `cmd.exe`. This can be a significant indicator of potential misuse, as scheduled tasks can be used by attackers for persistence and executing commands with elevated privileges at specified times.

### Application and System Log Analysis:
- The logs provided in these sections do not reveal direct indicators of compromise but should be monitored closely when paired with suspicious activity from security and sysmon logs.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious:** The combination of time alterations alongside attempts to execute and possibly manipulate logs or create persistency through scheduled tasks within a short timeframe, suggests that inappropriate or unauthorized actions may be occurring.

### Recommendations:
1. **User and Process Review:**
   - Investigate the actions of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` around the given timestamps. Confirm whether these activities align with expected administrative tasks.
   
2. **Scheduled Task Examination:**
   - Evaluate any scheduled tasks related to the `at.exe` usage and consider disabling or deleting any that are unauthorized.

3. **Log Integrity:**
   - Verify the integrity of Windows Event Logs for any signs of tampering or removal of evidential records.

4. **Alert on Reoccurrences:**
   - Configure alerts for future occurrences involving privileged command executions like `at.exe` or log alteration attempts with utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

Based on the analysis, this scenario is deemed **SUSPICIOUS** due to indicators that suggest further investigation is warranted to rule out any malicious intent or activities."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Lowercase Character in Password,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest were identified:

1. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts**
   - An event indicates that a PowerShell script was executed with a command aimed at changing a user's password to a specific value (""UPPER-LONG-SPECIAL-333""). This command includes checking a credentials file and updating its content, shown by logs of PowerShell operations: 
     ```
     $credFile = ""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\file\$env:USERNAME.txt""
     if (Test-Path $credFile) {
         $cred = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ...
         ...
         Set-ADAccountPassword -Identity $env:USERNAME -OldPassword $cred.password -NewPassword $newPassword
     }
     ```
   - The execution of such scripts, especially when dealing with account passwords in an automated manner, is often part of unauthorized privileged activity unless explicitly authorized and designed as part of system administration or automation tasks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**
   - There are multiple instances showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the same user, `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to manage event logs on Windows, and rapid, sequential, and repeated execution can be a sign of log clearing, potentially to cover tracks.
   
3. **Rapid Creation of Edge Installer Processes**
   - Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Installer (`setup.exe`) processes are logged under the system account. This could be indicative of software updates or installation activities. However, due to the system-level context and the number of executions, verification of intent (e.g., scheduled updates) is necessary, as such activity could be leveraged for persistence or privilege exploitation by malicious users.

4. **Analysis of Behavior**
   - The PowerShell script regarding password handling, and the high-volume execution of `wevtutil.exe` and Edge installer processes, pose a potential risk, given that such activities can be indicative of unauthorized access or privileged execution, especially if carried out without the corresponding legitimate cause or pattern (e.g., authorization, recent administrative changes, or authorized software installation).

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Assessment and Guidance:**
- **Threat Level:** Moderate; the presence of potentially unauthorized script execution related to password handling and event log utilities require immediate attention.
- **Recommendations:**
  - **Validation:** Confirm whether these PowerShell scripts and Edge installer executions were scheduled or authorized by IT operations. Verify if there are corresponding tickets or maintenance logs justifying these activities.
  - **Monitor:** Engage in close monitoring of `SERVER002\admin_test` activities across the network and system, as well as any further execution of similar scripts/processes.
  - **Review and Audit:** Conduct an audit on the event logs, particularly around the wevtutil executions to ensure no unauthorized log manipulations have occurred.
  - **Security Measures:** Evaluate the use of credential files and scripts in the organization, ensuring they are secured and usage is strictly controlled and monitored.
  
Decisive action is necessary to either confirm the benign nature of these logs through proper documentation/supporting information or escalate the investigation towards identifying potential unauthorized access or insider threats.
"
Juicy Potato,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

Based on the provided logs, there are several activities within the Sysmon and PowerShell logs that stand out for analysis:

1. **Frequent MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Executions:**
   - Numerous processes associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are seen throughout the logs. The frequent startup of update processes is typical for a software updater, especially for popular browsers like Microsoft Edge. This activity is expected as part of legitimate software maintenance.
   - However, execution from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU75F1.tmp`) is slightly unusual and warrants closer examination as it may suggest temporary storage used during the update process or potentially an untrusted source of execution if not properly verified.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command:**
   - A PowerShell command executes a script located within a temporary directory: `""powershell.exe"" & {cmd /c 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe' -l '7777' -t * -p '$env:windir\\system32\\notepad.exe' -c '{F7FD3FD6-9994-452D-8DA7-9A8FD87AEEF4}'}`.
   - The execution of a script from a temporary directory with parameters specified under PowerShell's execution context can potentially suggest malicious activity, especially if the script is hosted outside standard program directories.

3. **Security Context:**
   - Many of these processes run as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting high privilege and potentially greater risk if leveraged in an attack.

4. **Use of Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The usage of PowerShell to call cmd.exe chain to execute further indicates efforts to potentially obfuscate commands or run hidden processes, a technique often linked with malicious activity.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**

- The presence of a script being executed from a non-standard directory (`AppData\\Local\\Temp`) by PowerShell poses a significant security threat. Such activities could be indicative of an attempted exploit or post-exploitation activity aiming to escalate privileges or execute unauthorized actions on the system.
- The involvement of PowerShell, with its known capability for scripting and automation, combined with cmd.exe, raises the alert level for potentially harmful actions being orchestrated by a threat actor.

Change Startup Folder - HKLM Modify User Shell Folders Common Startup Value,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, there are some noteworthy observations. The focus here is to determine if there's any indication of potentially malicious activity.

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
    - The PowerShell logs indicate a script executed by `powershell.exe` that creates a new directory, copies `calc.exe` to this new directory and then modifies the registry setting related to `User Shell Folders`. This registry path is known to control startup applications. This behavior is typically associated with persistence techniques malware might employ to survive reboots and execute on system startup.

    - The command observed is:
      ```
      New-Item -ItemType Directory -path ""$env:TMP\filetest\""
      Copy-Item -path ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" -destination ""$env:TMP\filetest\""
      Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders"" -Name ""Common Startup"" -Value ""$env:TMP\filetest\""
      ```

    - Copying `calc.exe` and modifying registry keys for startup are not typical administrative tasks and suggest potentially malicious intent, especially when tied to PowerShell execution. Calc.exe is often used in testing scenarios but modifying registry keys like this is very suspicious.

2. **Process Execution and Privilege:**
    - The `Sysmon` logs show a series of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update. These appear to be regular updates managed by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These logs indicate expected activity unless there's a known vulnerability or exploit associated with Edge Update. However, no specific anomaly beyond the normal operation of Edge Update was observed in these logs.
    
    - There's also the execution of the `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are benign in isolation but if used in conjunction with other activities they may indicate enumeration or preparation steps for further actions.

3. **Security Logs:**
    - Logs showing the time change (`EventID 4616`) would typically indicate some scheduled tasks or system sync events. No critical anomaly here, however, it's always good to verify against expected system configuration.

**Assessment:**
- **PowerShell activity** is indeed suspicious as it modifies the startup behavior of the system which is a common persistence mechanism used by malware.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
  The activity detected requires further investigation. The PowerShell command suggests potential malicious intent, possibly indicating an attempt to maintain persistence. Consider quarantining the affected host for further examination and conduct a thorough file and behavior investigation to rule out any compromise or drill deeper into the PowerShell script source and intent.

**Guidance:**

- Review the integrity and security of user accounts and configurations.
- Confirm the execution policies for PowerShell on the affected host and adjust them if necessary to prevent such activities.
- Investigate subsequent activities following this event for potential indicators of lateral movement or data access."
Suspicious vbs file run from startup Folder,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, there are several indicators suggesting potentially suspicious behavior, as detailed below:

### 1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:
- **Timestamps Oct 27, 2024, around 15:23:16**: 
  - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of commands that copy and execute a VBScript file (`vbsstartup.vbs`) from a temporary directory to the startup directories. The commands aim to deploy a script at startup, which is a typical behavior associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware.
  - The execution of `cscript.exe` to run VBScript files from startup directories is unusual for regular administrative activity and often seen in malicious setups.

### 2. Suspicious Process Activity as logged by Sysmon:
- **Involvement of `cscript.exe` and PowerShell**: 
  - The presence of `cscript.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell-based operations reinforces the possibility of scripted automation to perform malicious tasks.
- **Processes executed from temporary directories**:
  - Executing scripts or binaries from the `%APPDATA%` or `Temp` directory is often indicative of malware trying to persist on the system.
- **Pattern of process execution**: 
  - The process execution sequences recorded suggest a potential chain of activities initiated with `PowerShell`, followed by `cscript`, which aligns with tactics to hide malicious intentions within seemingly normal system utility usage.

### 3. Unusual Security Log Entries:
- **Time Changes:**
  - Security log events with ID 4616 indicate time adjustments. While this by itself is not always malicious, adjusting system time can be used to evade time-based detection methods or correlate logs.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit a pattern that is commonly associated with attempts to establish persistence on a system, likely involving some type of malware or unauthorized script deployment.

### Recommendations and Next Steps:
1. **Quarantine the Machine**: Since this is flagged on the CEO's machine, it is imperative to isolate the machine from the network immediately to prevent any potential spread of malicious activities.
2. **Conduct a Thorough Malware Scan**: Utilize advanced endpoint threat detection tools to thoroughly scan the affected system for malware fingerprints, including searching for further indicators of compromise (IoC) associated with the identified scripts.
3. **Analyze `vbsstartup.vbs` Script**: Investigate the contents of the VBScript to understand its functionality and potential harm.
4. **Review and Block Indicators**: Identify the origin of the copied VBScript files and block any known indicators, like URLs or IP addresses, from accessing the network.
5. **User Awareness and Training**: Given the association with an admin_test user, consider evaluating recent changes or provisioning requests under this account and consider bolstering security training regarding script execution risks.

This situation demands prompt actions to avert potential compromise and secure sensitive company data, especially given the involved user profile. Further investigation may be necessary to conclude the intent and origin of these actions."
PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity are observed, primarily focusing on the Windows PowerShell logs and their integration with Sysmon logs. Below is a detailed analysis:

### PowerShell Logs Analysis:
1. **Scheduled Task Creation**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell events show the creation and modification of a scheduled task (`fileTaskModifed`). 
   - The script involves creating a scheduled task that initially triggers `cmd.exe` at logon for the `BUILTIN\Administrators` group with the highest run level. The action is later replaced with `Notepad.exe`.

2. **Privilege Escalation Attempt**:
   - The use of the `New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal` command with the `-GroupId ""BUILTIN\Administrators""` and `-RunLevel Highest` indicates an attempt to execute actions with elevated privileges.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **Process Execution**:
   - **Processes Involved**: Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - **PowerShell Execution Parent**: PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) shown as the parent process for some activities, indicating scripting activities through PowerShell.
   - **Network Interface Manipulation**: Presence of execution from common administrative tools (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) performed by `admin_test` could be an attempt to gather system information or consolidate network manipulation.

### Security Logs Analysis:
1. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Time manipulation is observed in security event logs, where the `PreviousTime` is set ahead and then reverted back (`NewTime` shows an earlier timestamp). This could point towards an attempt to cover tracks by altering system time to mismatch logs.

2. **Privilege Usage**:
   - `4662` and `4672` events log usage of several high-value privileges like `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege`. These are typically associated with administrative or potential malicious activities when exploited improperly.

### Assessment:
- The combination of creating a scheduled task with administrative privileges and altering the executable involved in the task, alongside system time manipulation, strongly indicates suspicious behavior.
- This type of activity is often associated with attempts to establish persistence through scheduled tasks or obfuscate actions by tampering with system logs.
- Privilege escalation attempts via scheduled tasks and the use of high-integrity-level operations are red flags within a compromised scenario.

### Threat and Risk Assessment:
- There is a **significant risk** that these logs indicate an adversary's attempt to establish persistence, escalate privileges, and potentially maintain control over the system without notice.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Immediate Action**: Investigate the user account `admin_test`, along with any potential unauthorized access to escalate privileges.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive review of any other scheduled tasks on the system to identify unauthorized changes. Validation of other systems for similar entries should be conducted to rule out broader compromise.
- **Mitigation Measures**: Implement additional monitoring for scheduled task changes and evaluate PowerShell script execution policies to block potentially harmful behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not look right and require further investigation to determine the full scope and potential impact of the activities identified."
Suspicious jse file run from startup Folder,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings and assessments based on the events:

### Suspicious Indicators
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
    - There are instances of PowerShell executing commands that involve the copying of a file `jsestartup.jse` to the startup directories, followed by executing these scripts using `cscript.exe` with the `/E:Jscript` option. The use of `Copy-Item` to popular startup directories and execution of JScript files by `cscript.exe` is particularly suspicious as this can be used to establish persistence by adding malicious scripts to run on startup.

2. **Commands Observed:**
    - `Copy-Item ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\src\\jsestartup.jse"" ""$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\jsestartup.jse""`
    - `Copy-Item ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\src\\jsestartup.jse"" ""C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\StartUp\\jsestartup.jse""`
    - `cscript.exe /E:Jscript ""[Path to JSE files]""`

3. **Sysmon Log Activity:**
    - Several activities related to `cscript.exe` executing `jsestartup.jse` scripts are observed. This behavior could be part of a sophisticated attack that seeks to persist malicious scripts across system reboots.

### Benign Indicators
1. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
    - There are multiple logs showing updates for Microsoft Edge. These involve processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup`, which are legitimate system update activities. These are identified by their directory paths, file versions, and descriptions related to Microsoft Edge Update.

2. **Other System Services Activities:**
    - Various instances of `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` processes running seem to correspond to regular system activities like time synchronization and system management processes.

### Assessment

Based on the evidence:

- **Persistence Mechanisms Employed:** The copying of scripts to startup directories by PowerShell and the subsequent use of `cscript.exe` can often signify attempts to introduce persistence mechanisms on the system. This activity is consistent with tactics used in certain types of malware or unauthorized scripts aiming for persistence.

- **Connection to Administration Tasks:** Other system log entries (e.g., edge updates) are common in administrative contexts and are likely benign under the context provided.

### Conclusion

The identified PowerShell and `cscript.exe` activities are highly irregular and could indicate post-exploitation behavior or the use of malicious scripts to maintain persistence within the system. Therefore, the activity found in these logs is assessed as:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Isolate the system to prevent potential propagation.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to examine the contents of `jsestartup.jse` and any associated files.
   - Review other logs for any network connections or external communications that could indicate data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Remove any unauthorized startup scripts or files identified as components of this persistence mechanism.
   - Implement monitoring for similar PowerShell and script activities across other endpoints.

3. **Prevention:**
   - Harden policies regarding script execution and startup folder access.
   - Ensure all systems have the latest updates and endpoint protection active.

These actions should help minimize the risk of any ongoing malicious activity and strengthen overall security posture."
Winlogon Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, here is the detailed analysis and assessment:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, we observe the execution of a PowerShell command: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Shell"" ""explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force`.
   - This command modifies the Registry's Winlogon Shell key. The typical value for the Shell key is `explorer.exe`, but the inclusion of `cmd.exe` indicates potential persistence mechanism or backdoor attempt, where a command prompt would open during user's login, which can be leveraged for malicious activities.

2. **Involvement of Elevated Privileges:**
   - PowerShell was executed with high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating potential privilege abuse.
   - This action appears deliberate to maintain persistence upon user logon, potentially causing security risks.

3. **Unusual and Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - The Sysmon log shows repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the use of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` can be normal, the frequency and pattern should be assessed for potential obfuscation or tunneling attempts from within the system.

4. **Time Adjustment Evidence:**
   - Security and System logs show time changes (`EventID 4616` and `EventID 1` from Kernel-General), although tied to system services and unlikely indicative of compromise by themselves.

Given these observations, the activity in the logs, especially the modification of the Winlogon shell, strongly suggests a sophisticated attempt to compromise the system's integrity by setting up persistence for potentially unauthorized access or further exploitation.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Persistence mechanism via Registry modification to execute command prompt on user logon.
- Potential unauthorized access or actions that could follow through the opened command prompt.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the machine to prevent further unauthorized access and propagation.
- Perform a comprehensive security audit and an in-depth forensic analysis of this and related systems.
- Restore the registry settings to their default state to remove unauthorized persistence mechanisms.
- Conduct a root cause analysis to identify how the script was executed, addressing vulnerabilities or phishing attempts that may have led to this activity.
- Ensure antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems are updated and perform full scans."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis highlights potentially suspicious behavior and assesses the overall situation:

### Assessment:

- **Command Execution and Registry Modifications:**
  - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are executing commands that include running the `reg.exe` tool to modify registry keys related to `GroupPolicyRefreshTime` and other settings. The command-line arguments provided:
    ```
    cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System"" /v GroupPolicyRefreshTimeDC /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f ...
    ```
    This repeated registry modification activity can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate system behavior. Disabling or modifying system policies like `EnableSmartScreen` and setting registry keys to `0` might suggest an attempt to weaken security protections.

- **Unusual Time Changes:**
  - `svchost.exe` has been used to change the system time, which is documented repeatedly in the logs. Time manipulation can be used to evade detection or sync timing with other malicious activities.

- **Frequent and Suspicious Use of Administrative Tools:**
  - Several events show the use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `reg.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The frequency and nature of these tools being run in conjunction with registry changes may suggest unusual administrative activity.

- **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
  - There is a series of events showing activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These activities appear normal for a Microsoft Edge update process including typical update commands and execution under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. However, checking for legitimate update frequency and the origin of the update files may be warranted to exclude misuse.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- The registry modifications present a risk to system security configurations by setting policy values that disable or alter critical security features.
- The occurrence of `cmd.exe` running repeated registry modifications under a high integrity level suggests increased risk of privilege misuse.
- Time modification events need investigation to determine if they are scheduled maintenance events or attempts to cloak activities.

### Guidance:

- **Further Investigation Required:**
  - Verify if the `reg.exe` actions are legitimate by consulting with IT or system administrators. They often have specific maintenance procedures; otherwise, it could indicate improper handling or a breach.
  - Apply further scrutiny on the environment for any unintended changes or deviations from standard security protocols.
  - Review system or network logs for anomalies coinciding with the events identified above.

### Resolution:

Based on the logs provided, the resolution is classified as:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities recorded suggest unusual behavior that necessitates further investigation to determine the legitimacy and potential threat level."
Domain Password Policy Check: Short Password,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Observations and Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs detail multiple invocations of a script that involves handling credentials secured in a file. A specific script is continually executed, attempting to change the user password to ""Uplow-1"" using stored credentials.
   - The script checks if a credential file exists (`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\file\$env:USERNAME.txt`), compares it against the new password ""Uplow-1"", and if it matches, an error message is displayed, and execution is halted.
   - The script attempts to change the Active Directory account password using `Set-ADAccountPassword`, which is a significant action that could indicate either legitimate admin maintenance or a potential alteration by an attacker.
   - Notably, if an error occurs due to an incorrect password, the file is deleted with `Remove-Item $credFile`.

2. **Suspicious Behaviors:**
   - Repeated attempts to set a password to ""Uplow-1"" without any other context or command explanation is suspicious. Standard operational scripts, if legitimate, would typically use more complex passwords and might not attempt setting passwords repeatedly without context.
   - Also, the manner of the error handling, such as deleting the credential file upon failure, could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or cover tracks.

3. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple instances involve the execution of binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, all executed under the account `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - While `wevtutil.exe` is often used to manage event logs and is potentially used here to view or clear logs, frequent execution in quick succession without clear rationale is suspicious, potentially indicating attempts to manipulate or review logs for misdirection.

4. **Indicators of Potential Risks:**
   - Execution of PowerShell script with the hardcoded password and credential file handling.
   - Multiple administrative command executions in a short period (`wevtutil`, `whoami`, `hostname`), which typically indicate privilege validation or environment checks by attackers.
   - High-integrity level of operations, indicating they were run with elevated privileges.

#### Assessment:
The repeated execution of PowerShell scripts and associated activities that interact with credentials and attempt password changes raise significant suspicion. Furthermore, the use of tools like `wevtutil.exe` potentially to manipulate event logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

#### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The examined logs contain activity that doesn't look right and requires further investigation. There is a potential risk of malicious activity given the context of password manipulations, credential handling, and the rapid sequence of related sysadmin tool executions.

#### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the scripts used and their required usage scenario on the CEO's machine.
   - Review any associated logs of related user accounts to determine any unauthorized access or credentials misuse.

2. **Contain and Remediate:**
   - If unauthorized activity is confirmed, ensure the affected credentials and systems are secured, perhaps by locking accounts or re-deploying secure configurations.
   - Review the system for any recently modified configurations or logs to identify post-exploitation actions.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement advanced monitoring solutions for PowerShell and related executables to capture and review command-line activities for early detection of any similar attempts in the future.

4. **Await Confirmation from the User:**
   - Communicate with the user or responsible parties to verify if these activities were legitimate and document their explanations and any instructions provided for corrective measures.

These actions will better isolate the root cause of the activity and determine whether it is benign or warrants defensive response measures."
Allowing custom application to execute during new RDP logon session,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity were identified. Here's a breakdown of the findings categorized by type:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **Registry Modification by cmd.exe:**
   - EventID: `5800` shows `cmd.exe` being executed with the command line to modify the registry: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Wds\rdpwd"" /v StartupPrograms /t REG_SZ /d ""calc""`.
   - This type of registry modification can be used to achieve persistence, where an application (`calc` in this case) is set to start automatically, which is indicative of potentially malicious intent.

2. **Command and Execution via PowerShell:**
   - Events with `PowerShell` activity where scripts are executed with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`. Notably, EventID: `3500` and `4412` displayed commands being executed, which included complex scripts to interact with system directories, often seen in obfuscation techniques used by malware.
   - Use of PowerShell is common in both administrative tasks and attacks, especially when scripts are run with restricted policies circumvented.

3. **Process Creation related to Service Control:**
   - Sysmon logs (EventID 18071 and others) show multiple `taskhostw.exe` processes, which are typical, but their relation to creating or controlling services is critical to observe. Persistent or timed tasks to utilize this for launching malicious processes need further probe.

4. **Multiple Instances of `CompatTelRunner.exe`:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events (e.g., EventID 18078,18080) show execution of `CompatTelRunner.exe`. While this is a legitimate Windows service, its frequent invocation indicates it might be used for purposes other than intended telemetry, possibly indicative of attempting system scans or persistence mechanisms.

5. **Unauthorized Access Attempts:**
   - There are multiple `EventID: 5379` in the Security log showing failed credential reading attempts with `WindowsLive` and Microsoft Account tokens, which might indicate attempts to exfiltrate sensitive credential information.

### Malicious Assessment:
The logs present multiple indications of potential compromise:
- The usage of PowerShell and command prompt (`cmd.exe`) for potentially unauthorized activities like registry modifications and script executions is consistent with methods often used in attacker techniques for persistent foothold or lateral movement.
- Suspicious process executions and failed credential access attempts indicative of reconnaissance or unauthorized access attempts.
  
### Conclusion and Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of unauthorized registry edits intended for persistence and erratic PowerShell activities signify a potential compromise.
  
### Guidance: 
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Conduct a thorough scan of the affected system for known malware using both antivirus and heuristic intrusion detection tools.
  - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Inspect and remediate any unauthorized persistent modifications found, particularly those affecting startup items.
  - Review user activity and connectivity logs for anomalous access patterns.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate correlated logs for the same timeframes across other devices/networks for signs of lateral movement or coordinated attacks.
  - Conduct vulnerability assessments and ensure endpoint defenses (EDR/AV) are updated and properly configured.

This pattern analysis insists on reviewing internal protocol methods to enforce tighter security measures against such techniques used in the observed log events."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL load technique,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### **System Log Analysis**

- **EventID 1 & 24 (Time changes)**: 
  - The system logs reveal repeated small changes to the system time by the ""svchost.exe"" process, which is typically normal as this process manages various Windows services. The time changes are minor and the reason stated in the logs is ""Reason: 1"", which often indicates a time correction synchronized with an external time source. Therefore, these entries alone do not imply malicious activity, but should be noted especially if unexpected time manipulations are observed consistently.

#### **Security Log Analysis**

- **EventID 4616 (System Time Changed)**: 
  - These events indicate changes in system time, resonating with the system log entries and are executed by ""svchost.exe"". Given that these are orchestrated by a legitimate Windows process under the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account, they don't inherently suggest malicious activity.

#### **Application Log Analysis**

- **Software Protection Platform Log**: 
  - Normal activity related to updates of software protection rules indicating that Windows Defender is active, which helps in defending against malware by keeping its signatures up-to-date.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis**

- **EventID 600 (Execution of PowerShell script)**: 
  - There is suspicious PowerShell activity where ""powershell.exe"" is downloading and executing a script from an external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script-Techniques/master/UsoDLL/Get-UsoClientDLLSystem.ps1). This kind of behavior is often associated with malware because attackers frequently use PowerShell to download and execute malicious scripts without writing files to disk. This is a major red flag for potential compromise.
  
#### **Sysmon Log Analysis**

- **Events Related to PowerShell and CMD processes**: 
  - Reoccurring launches of PowerShell from the temporary directory are found alongside calls to a suspicious URL for script execution. This is consistent with attempts to run scripts from an external source and should be flagged as potentially malicious activity.
  - Processes like ""hostname.exe"" and ""whoami.exe"" are observed—a commonality in pen-testing or red team activities to gather environment reconnaissance, which further indicates anomalous behavior.

### **Assessment of the Situation**

There is clear evidence of suspicious behavior that is highly indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Malicious PowerShell Activity**: The downloading of a script from an external site using PowerShell is a critical indicator of a potential system compromise.
2. **Reconnaissance Behavior**: Frequent execution of system enumeration tools such as `whoami`, `hostname`, and these being parent processes for further exploration commands suggest an attempt to gather information about the system, possibly for further exploitation.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence:

- The system time changes, while benign in context, form part of a larger pattern of suspicious behavior.
- The execution of external PowerShell scripts and system reconnaissance activities suggest active malicious attempts to compromise or exploit this machine.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed**

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential data breach or exfiltration.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation, focusing on identifying the downloaded content and any potential changes made by the malicious script.
   
3. **Review Security Posture**:
   - Ensure that the latest security patches are applied to all systems and enhance existing monitoring capabilities.
   
4. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Educate the executive team and relevant personnel about the phishing risks and use of malicious PowerShell scripts to raise awareness about social engineering tactics. 

5. **Network Monitoring and Prevention**: 
   - Implement monitoring of abnormal PowerShell activity and restrict outbound network connections not essential for business operations.
   
This situation underscores the significance of proactive monitoring and the need for robust incident response capabilities to address potential threats and mitigate risks effectively."
HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup,"### Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several pieces of evidence suggestive of potential suspicious or anomalous behavior have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
    - The PowerShell logs indicate the creation of a registry key under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components` with the name `file_test` and setting properties `""ART TEST""` and `StubPath` pointing to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`.
    - Although the Calculator application (`calc.exe`) is a legitimate Windows utility, its use in this context is suspicious if it was used as a placeholder to test code execution or persistence mechanism. Using `runonce.exe` suggests an attempt to execute an application at startup.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - The logs contain multiple processes running under the `Server002\admin_test` account, including several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, and a PowerShell process executing potentially unwanted operations.
    - The specific PowerShell command aligns with what is logged in the PowerShell log, suggesting the command is executed during the Sysmon logging time.
    - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process for an elevated PowerShell session is noteworthy, as `wsmprovhost.exe` is related to Windows Remote Management and could indicate lateral movement or execution of remote commands if leveraged maliciously.

3. **Frequent Time Changes:**
    - Security and System logs indicate frequent time adjustments (`EventID 4616` and `Kernel-General EventID 1`). While these might result from regular time synchronization, their frequent occurrence could mask malicious activity involving delays or time manipulation.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
    - Numerous launch events for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line parameters suggest a scheduled or automatic update. However, if the timing conflicts with regular updates or the file hashes are unknown, it could present an opportunity for a malicious actor to execute code under the guise of a legitimate update process.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
The observed PowerShell behavior of setting potentially unnecessary registry keys and executing system binaries raises concerns about code execution and persistence. Further, the set `StubPath` to `calc.exe` might not be harmful directly, but its use implies testing or a potential pivot point for other executables. 

The combination of PowerShell manipulation, Sysmon events demonstrating utility exploitation (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`), and registry persistence mechanisms are typical tactics used in malicious operations.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Resolution - SUSPICIOUS:**
    - The logs contain activity that is suspicious and necessitates further investigation. The use of PowerShell to modify the registry, combined with the observed Sysmon and Security events, suggests a suspicious script or script-like behavior that needs thorough analysis to rule out potential compromise.

2. **Action Items:**
    - **Forensics Analysis:** Conduct a deeper dive into file modifications and process execution chains to understand the context and intent of the changes.
    - **Malware Scan:** Perform comprehensive AV/malware scans for the CEO’s machine and the entire network segment.
    - **Review Scheduled Tasks:** Check for any unauthorized scheduled tasks or startup entries, particularly around the time the registry keys were modified.
    - **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Analyze network traffic for unusual remote connections or data exfiltration corresponding to the times in question.
    - **User Access Review:** Confirm the legitimacy of `admin_test` user's actions during the timeline and ensure there was no unauthorized access.
   
Given the nature of these events, proactive monitoring and immediate incident response measures are recommended to prevent potential compromise expansion."
Read-Write-Execute process Injection,"**Detailed Analysis:**

- **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**: The logs reveal multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed with complex command-line arguments, which is often a characteristic of potentially malicious activity. The specific PowerShell command as recorded in the log executes a script related to `searchVuln.exe` and `RWXinjectionLocal.exe`, which suggests attempts to exploit vulnerabilities or execute memory injections, particularly against a `vuln_dll`.

- **Suspicious File Execution**: The involvement of executables like `searchVuln.exe` and `RWXinjectionLocal.exe`, especially from temporary directories, raises red flags. It's not common for legitimate software to run from the AppData Local Temp directory with such operations.

- **Elevation of Privileges & System Integrity**: The logs indicate the activity is executed with high integrity levels, which might suggest attempts of privilege escalation or thorough access to system resources.

- **Process Creation Patterns**: Although system processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are seen, the context and succession with which they are executed here is unusual. Particularly, the repeated spawning of processes using the `SYSTEM` account or administrative accounts (`SERVER002\admin_test`) is characteristic of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts within a compromised system.

**Assessment of Situation:**

Based on the data, several indicators of compromise are present:
- **Unusual Command Line Execution**: The PowerShell commands and execution sequence suggest potential scripting or automation of exploitation tools.
- **High Privilege Utilization**: Consistent high privilege execution, especially from directories and paths not typically involved in system administration, points towards an unauthorized modification or intrusion.
- **Temporary Directory Execution**: The use of temporary paths for executing potential exploitation binaries is highly suspicious.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance & Next Steps:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential compromise or spread.
2. Initiate a full forensic investigation on the machine to understand the extent and entry point of the compromise.
3. Review and enhance PowerShell script execution policies, configure appropriate logging, and monitor for similar activities across the infrastructure.
4. As a preventive measure, educate users, especially those with elevated privileges, about recognizing and mitigating potential phishing and script-based attacks.
5. Evaluate the need for additional tools or updates to the EDR and endpoint security solutions to detect and respond to similar threats more effectively."
Scheduled task Remote,"Given the provided logs, let's look into each section for any signs of malicious activity or anomalies.

### Application Log
- Only one event by ""Software Protection Platform Service"" which seems like a routine entry related to licensing checks and doesn't indicate any suspicious behavior.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- This section is empty and provides no data for analysis.

### System Log
- **Kernel-General and Time-Service events** indicate a system time change. It is not unusual to see time adjustments due to synchronization with an NTP server such as `time.windows.com`. The adjustment back by 10 seconds could be an operation carried out by the system to correct its clock.
- No explicit signs of malicious or suspicious activity can be deduced from these time-related events alone.

### Security Log
- **Security-Auditing events (EventID 4616)** also represent time changes. The user `LOCAL SERVICE` is involved, which aligns with legitimate system time synchronization operations.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process creation logs notable for process monitoring**, especially involving administrative user `admin_test`.
- Execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and creation of a scheduled task using `SCHTASKS` raises concerns. It's noteworthy because:
  - `whoami.exe` is often used to verify permissions and user status, a step sometimes included in reconnaissance or privilege escalation scenarios.
  - `schtasks.exe` being used to create a task (especially with command line arguments directly involving credentials `/RP At0micStrong`) is a common persistence technique in attacks.
- The command `""cmd.exe"" /c SCHTASKS /Create /S localhost /RU DOMAIN\\user /RP At0micStrong /TN ""file task"" /TR ""C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /SC daily /ST 20:10` is suspicious. Creating tasks that utilize `cmd.exe` to run another shell on a persistent basis is a recognized method for retaining system access.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The operation involving creating a scheduled task with administrative privileges and hardcoded credentials suggests potential compromise or at least abuse of privileges. This aligns with activities that attackers could use for persistence or to maintain scheduled malicious activities.
- **Recommendation:** Further investigation is needed to determine:
  - The legitimacy of the scheduled task `file task` and whether it was authorized.
  - Any correlation with known TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) in recent or on-going threats.
  - Check the credentials used (`DOMAIN\\user` and `At0micStrong`) for legitimacy and unauthorized access.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities within the logs warrant further investigation to rule out any malicious intent."
Section View Injection,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Change Anomalies**:
   The logs indicate multiple instances of time changes (Event ID 4616 in Security Log and ID 1 in the System Log). The events document the time on the system being set back. Such activity might be indicative of attempts to cover tracks or confuse time-based log analysis. Time changes, particularly if unexpected or unexplained, are suspicious.

2. **Privileged Logon and Privileges**:
   Event ID 4624 with privileges (Event ID 4672) shows an account `admin_test` logging in with several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. While this may be typical for administrative accounts, the combination of numerous elevated privileges and the suspicious time changes can magnify concerns of malicious activity, especially if this account is not expected to perform such actions.

3. **Command Execution and Possible Persistence Mechanism**:
   From the Sysmon logs, PowerShell command execution is detected which includes starting Notepad and starting a suspicious executable `InjectView.exe` located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\`. This command execution appears malicious since `InjectView.exe` could signify a tool that may be used for further exploitation, persistence, or data extraction.

4. **Multiple Sysinternal Processes**:
   There are events indicating processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by `admin_test`. High frequency of interactions with event logs (via `wevtutil.exe`), cloaked under a potentially compromised account suggests an effort to manage logs to delete or obfuscate potential evidence of malicious operations.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- Usage of tools potentially related to privilege escalation (`InjectView.exe`) and the manipulation or review of event logs (`wevtutil.exe`).
- Execution from `Temp` directories could be an indicator of an attempt to evade traditional security monitoring mechanisms.
- PowerShell commands suspiciously combined with other processes suggest potential backdoor or malware installation activities.

### Assessment

Based on the above analysis, the combination of suspicious time adjustments, elevated privilege abuse, command execution involving potentially malicious software, and several anomalies in process execution together form a pattern that is consistent with malicious activity.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions**:
  1. Isolate and examine the `admin_test` account for unauthorized changes or unusual activities.
  2. Investigate `InjectView.exe` for malware characteristics.
  3. Review system access policies, especially regarding the `admin_test` account, and reset system and application passwords.
  4. Conduct a broader threat hunt on connected systems to ensure no lateral movement or further compromise.
  5. Check logs for any other unsuccessful logins or attempted privilege escalations.

- **Long-term Measures**:
  1. Enhance monitoring with specific attention to unauthorized privilege escalations and PowerShell script execution.
  2. Conduct user training and awareness programs to ensure all staff recognize signs of phishing and social engineering attacks which can lead to such breaches.
  3. Implement stricter logging policies and audit configurations to detect similar activities more swiftly in the future."
EarlyBird APC Queue Injection in Go,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Overview
The logs provided span various categories, including Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, System, and Application logs. The focus will be primarily on behavioral patterns that indicate potential security threats, like unauthorized process execution, suspicious command-lines, privilege escalation, and time service manipulations.

### Key Findings

1. **Process Execution Anomalies**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** The execution of `PowerShell.exe` with specific command-line parameters to run `EarlyBird.exe` seems suspicious. This executable is run from a temporary location and instructs `werfault.exe`, a legitimate Windows error handling process, with the `-debug` switch. This behavior is atypical and often associated with debugging processes used in malicious activities for injecting malicious code or executing payloads stealthily.
   - **Wevtutil.exe Usage:** There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. Although this is a legitimate process for managing event logs, frequent and automated usage outside of regular administrative tasks can indicate log clearing attempts or reconnaissance activities by attackers.

2. **Privilege Use and Escalation**
   - **Admin_test Account Privileges:** The account `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed with a wide range of elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc.) immediately after authenticating using NTLM, which is a concern if not warranted by normal usage patterns. 
   - **Repeated Privilege Grants:** There are repeated occurrences of privilege assignments to `admin_test`, pointing toward either elevated operations being performed for legitimate administrative reasons or suspicious activities requiring higher access rights.

3. **Suspicious System Alterations**
   - **Time Synchronization Activity:** Attempts to alter the system time (`EventID 24 and 1 from Kernel-General`) appear in close succession and are out of sync (`EventID 4616 from the Security log`) which may indicate attempts to manipulate log timestamps as a concealment strategy in malicious activities.
   - **Svchost Activity:** The svchost process, typically running as a service host, is found altering the system time closely resembling tactics used to change system logs for covering tracks.

4. **Unusual Network Activity**
   - IP addresses associated with the logon events remain consistent with single system-to-system connections, which is normal in internal environments but potentially suspicious if the source is external or unexpected.

5. **System-Level Activities**
   - **Microsoft Edge Updates:** System-level update processes for Edge are noted, running with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. While these updates are common, they need verification to ensure they are legitimate updates and not maliciously tampered tasks.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the situation is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**:
- The execution patterns of PowerShell with the `werfault` process are indicative of potentially malicious behavior.
- Frequent use of elevated privileges and repeated attempts to alter system time suggest possible unauthorized or malicious operations.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` and privilege assignments support the hypothesis of anomalous activities needing further investigation.

### Recommendations for Next Steps
1. **Containment and Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement by a threat actor exploiting elevated privileges.
   - Investigate `EarlyBird.exe` and its presence in the temp directory.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine the context and intent behind `admin_test`'s logon sessions and security clarity over NTLM usage.
   - Validate the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge updates, cross-checking against corporate update policies.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Enable enhanced logging for PowerShell and critically observe any further anomalous behavior.
   - Conduct a full audit of privilege assignments and configurations to ensure only necessary accesses are available.

Developing a clear incident response plan involving security experts to address these anomalies is crucial to promptly remediating and securing the affected system effectively."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Let's break down the logs and identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Application Log Analysis
- The application logs for `edgeupdate` service indicate that the service was stopped twice in quick succession. This alone isn't immediately suspicious as software updates or service restarts can cause this. However, given the context of other logs, this repetitive stop could suggest tampering or misuse.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- The PowerShell logs reveal a script executing that modifies the Windows Security Packages in the registry from a known value to `AtomicTest.dll`. This behavior is a critical red flag because:
  - The modification of LSA (`Local Security Authority`) Security Packages in the registry is a known technique for persistence and privilege escalation.
  - The use of PowerShell to script such a change is a common approach for attackers who attempt to install malicious DLLs for further exploitation.

### System Log Analysis
- The system logs show event log clearance activities by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is typically an action taken to cover up tracks following illicit activities.

### Security Log Analysis
- A security event with ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared. This is a highly suspicious activity, especially when conducted by a user with elevated privileges such as `admin_test`.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed to clear various logs (Application, System, Security) using the command line. This pattern is indicative of an attempt to remove evidence of malicious activities.
- There is a record of `whoami.exe` usage, which attackers often use to verify access levels or permissions in the environment post-compromise.
- A PowerShell script is observed performing the same malicious behavior with LSA registry modification found in the PowerShell logs.
- `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables appearing several times in the logs suggest a software update, which is typically benign; however, the context implies it could be a cover operation. 

### Overall Assessment
The observed activities are consistent with potential post-exploitation tactics:
- The registry modification in security tokens, especially when involving `AtomicTest.dll`, aligns with known malicious patterns.
- The clearing of system, security, and application logs immediately after such registry alterations closely resembles an attempt to hide malicious activities.
- The use of PowerShell with high integrity levels and execution of classic reconnaissance tools like `whoami` is further suspicious.

### Conclusion
The behavior captured in the event logs strongly indicates a compromise. The evidence, particularly the unauthorized registry edits via a script and systematic log cleaning by the `admin_test` account, points to unauthorized access and misuse of the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Immediate Incident Response actions should be triggered.
- Isolation of the affected host to prevent further spread.
- Detailed forensic investigation to determine entry points, potential data exfiltration, and involved actors.
- Implementation of appropriate remediation steps including patching and tightening security policies, notably around PowerShell execution and administrative logins.

Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Security Logs
1. **Event ID 4624 & 4672**: Repeated SYSTEM account logons with logon type 5 (service logon), displaying privileges typical for system activity e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege. These events are not inherently suspicious as SYSTEM account activities are common for legitimate operations. However, they should be aware of potential misuse if combined with other suspicious activities.

2. **Event ID 5379**: Logs for credential validations show a failure with ReturnCode 3221226021 (STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER), which might suggest attempts at accessing non-existent accounts or due to configuration errors.

3. **Event ID 4798**: Queries for the admin and guest account details by `taskhostw.exe` could indicate normal system maintenance tasks, but frequent enumeration of user accounts could also hint at reconnaissance activities.

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **Process Creation Events**: Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, executed with `admin_test` context. The legitimacy of processes like `hostname`, `wevtutil`, executed together and enumerated could be indicative of enumeration or data gathering, especially if not parts of a batch or script.

2. **Suspicious Powershell Activity**: A command execution through PowerShell involving `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe` raises suspicion. This file path and invocation method are uncommon and may suggest malicious activity such as executing arbitrary code by utilizing PowerShell, a known tactic for attackers due to its powerful capabilities.

#### PowerShell Logs
- **Command Execution**: Reflects the execution of PowerShell script lines with a potentially suspicious executable `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe`. This warrants investigation as it may facilitate code injection or facilitate lateral movements.

### Assessment
Based on the collected data, activities such as the use of PowerShell with unusual binaries and the frequent enumeration of user accounts warrant a closer examination of intent and context which could not be definitively concluded within the provided logs as malicious. Suspicious attempts to access invalid accounts could also indicate probing or initial access attempts.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity (unusual PowerShell usage with potentially malicious executables and anomalous user account enumeration) that doesn't look right and necessitates further investigation. Although not overtly malicious, the combination of these indicators can suggest potential risks or threats, especially on a CEO's machine.

### Recommendations

1. **Investigate PowerShell Execution**: Examine the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script involving `NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe`.
  
2. **Audit Account Enumeration**: Investigate the context of the user account enumeration by `taskhostw.exe` to ensure it aligns with expected system operations.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Temporarily enhance the monitoring on the CEO's computer for advanced attempts or follow-up actions from suspicious activities.

4. **Access Control Review**: Verify that service accounts and admin privileges are not misused and confirm legitimate usage contexts. 

Further investigation and correlation with additional logs or context may either clarify the suspicion or help mitigate any potential compromise."
Winlogon Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs for the Windows host, several entries exhibit suspicious behavior.

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Event Record ID 1043 to 1049 (PowerShell Logs):** 
     - The logs show PowerShell activity where a suspicious command is executed: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force`.
     - This modification to the Userinit registry key changes Userinit’s value to start `cmd.exe` upon user logon. Such an action can be indicative of a malicious attempt for persistence, allowing for potential unauthorized command shell access each time the user logs on.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - **Process Creations by PowerShell (Event Record ID 17980):**
     - Process `powershell.exe` executed with a command to modify registry keys related to `Winlogon` with `cmd.exe`. This is consistent with the suspicious behavior seen in the PowerShell logs and suggests a coordinated effort to modify login behaviors.
   - **Use of `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` (Event Record ID series earlier):**
     - The use of `whoami.exe` and subsequent command shells could suggest reconnaissance or privilege verification activity, potentially to identify active users or elevated permissions.

3. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - These logs indicate Microsoft Edge Update processes running, which is typical and expected on a Windows system where Edge is installed. This behavior appears regular, as there are no directly suspicious command-line arguments or parent process anomalies related to these activities.

### Threat Assessment:

The modification of the `Userinit` registry key in the manner described is a well-known tactic for persistence by malicious actors and not typical of legitimate administrative tasks. The presence of this command in the PowerShell log, along with corresponding entries in the Sysmon logs showing the execution of altered commands, significantly raises the likelihood of malicious intent.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

- **Indicators of malicious activity**: The unauthorized registry modification to launch `cmd.exe` during the user logon process potentially indicates an attempted persistence mechanism by a threat actor.
- **Risk**: Unauthorized access and persistence, leading to potential data leaks, further system alterations, or facilitating lateral movement within the network.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Investigate open sessions and terminate any unauthorized access to the system. Isolate the host from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Reverse the registry changes made to `Userinit` to prevent unauthorized command execution at logon.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Capture memory and additional logs for deeper forensic analysis.
   - Identify how the malicious PowerShell command was triggered – investigate user login logs and potential ingress points.

3. **Future Protections:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and PowerShell execution policies.
   - Increase monitoring of registry changes, particularly within user logon keys.
   - Review and revise group policies and endpoint security configurations to prevent similar attacks.

These actions should be taken with urgency, and the findings should be communicated to your security leadership for further threat-hunting and incident response activities."
Service Installation PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest that there may be suspicious activity occurring on the system ""Server002."" Let's go through the relevant log entries:

### PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: 
   - There are multiple entries showing the execution of a PowerShell script that involves creating a new service called ""fileTestService_PowerShell"" with a binary path pointing to `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.003\bin\fileService.exe`.
   - The service is started immediately after creation, which is atypical for legitimate administrative tasks and can be indicative of an attempt to maintain persistence.

### System Logs:
1. **Service Control Manager**:
   - An event is logged indicating the creation of the service ""fileTestService_PowerShell"" as a user-mode service set to auto-start, under the `LocalSystem` account. 
   - Services created in temporary directories and with an immediate auto-start configuration are common tactics used by attackers to maintain persistence and execution with elevated privileges.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Creation Events**:
   - The execution of `fileService.exe` from the temporary directory aligns with the behavior described in the PowerShell events.
   - The `fileService.exe` runs under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, indicating the process is running with high-level privileges which can be exploited for malicious purposes.

2. **Suspicious Parent-Child Process Relationship**:
   - The PowerShell execution is initiated by a user `admin_test` and leads to the service execution under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting a possible privilege escalation.
   - This kind of hierarchy, wherein a lower-privileged process starts a higher-privileged service, needs further scrutiny to confirm whether it was expected and authorized.

### Application Logs:
1. **Service Status**:
   - Confirmation that ""fileService"" started successfully, showing it was operational post-creation. This aligns with the potential persistence mechanism set by the suspicious PowerShell script.

### Assessment:
- The combination of creating a service using PowerShell from a temporary directory, associating it with a suspicious binary, and running it with SYSTEM privileges raises serious concerns. This pattern is consistent with common adversaries’ attempts to establish persistence and could indicate a system compromise.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Given the context and indicators, the activity is highly indicative of a malicious compromise. The use of a service execution path in a temporary location, coupled with auto-start and execution under SYSTEM privileges, aligns with typical tactics used by threat actors to maintain control over a compromised system.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Terminate the `fileTestService_PowerShell` and any associated processes.
  - Investigate the origin and creation of `fileService.exe` in the specified directory.
  - Conduct a thorough review of the affected system to identify other potential signs of compromise or malware presence.
  - Review recent user activities, especially those of the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or changes.
  - Strengthen security measures, such as implementing tighter PowerShell script constraints and regularly reviewing auto-start service entries.

- **Long-term Recommendations**:
  - Strengthen defense in depth with endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions.
  - Regularly patch systems and applications to mitigate vulnerabilities.
  - Conduct routine security audits and user training to recognize and prevent similar issues in the future."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several aspects require attention to determine potential malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell was used to execute `werfault.exe` and then injected with `CreateRemoteThread.exe`. The command seen is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$process = Start-Process C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe -passthru; C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\CreateRemoteThread.exe -pid $process.Id -debug}
     ```
   - This behavior is suspicious. `werfault.exe` is normally used by Windows for error reporting, and its involvement in a script with `CreateRemoteThread.exe` suggests process injection, a technique often used by malware for stealth execution.

2. **Privilege Actions:**
   - The security log (EventID: 4672) shows that the user `admin_test` acquired several high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege` which could be misused if in the wrong hands.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Processes such as `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` are typically benign, but their context, when combined with PowerShell scripting and suspicious privileges, adds concern.
   - There's an observed pattern of multiple `conhost.exe` processes, which can be standard; however, it should be correlated with known user actions to rule out misuse or cover-ups for hidden console sessions.

4. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - The logs also show a time change (EventID: 4616) where `svchost.exe` adjusted the system time. While this could be benign, it’s worth analyzing whether this was in anticipation of scheduled malicious tasks or to disrupt logging/audit trails.

5. **Defender and Windows Update Activity:**
   - The logs show that Windows Defender was on (Application log), and security intelligence updates were applied (System log - EventID: 19), suggesting the system was receiving updates. However, malware attempting to disable updates can indicate a broader threat.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the detailed examination, the presence of a PowerShell script that attempts to execute a potentially malicious payload using process injection techniques is a strong indicator of a compromise. The high privileges granted to the `admin_test` account, coupled with unexplained system adjustments (time change), further supports this suspicion.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities and patterns noted in the logs—especially the PowerShell execution with `CreateRemoteThread.exe`—are indicative of malicious behavior likely meant to bypass security controls and persist covertly within the system.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent lateral movement and further compromise.
   - Review any external connections or data transfers from this system before isolation.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough disk and memory forensic analysis to extract any additional payloads that may have been dropped or to identify any exfiltrated data.
   - Check for other signs of persistence mechanisms and compromised accounts.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Patch and remediate any vulnerabilities leveraged during the attack.
   - Reset passwords and review account permissions with special attention to `admin_test` and any related accounts.

4. **Monitoring and Review:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring on critical systems.
   - Conduct a company-wide security review and user education on recognizing phishing threats that might encourage this type of exploit.

Focus on remediating the immediate threat and performing a comprehensive review of the security posture to prevent similar incidents."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis is produced based on each log section:

### PowerShell Logs
The PowerShell logs reveal several executions of PowerShell commands. The main command in question is:
```
powershell.exe & {Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Process -Property Name, CommandLine, ProcessId -Filter ""Name = 'svchost.exe' AND CommandLine LIKE '%'"" | Select-Object -First 1 | Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -FilePath $Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -CommandLine '-Command Start-Sleep 10'}
```
This command is complex and indicates an attempt to examine ‘svchost.exe’ processes, combined with starting a new PowerShell instance with a sleep command. While such usage isn't inherently malicious, it can suggest attempts to execute further operations in a potentially controlled manner. This could be part of a penetration test or an unauthorized script execution.

Another log entry indicates a command execution:
```
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command ...
```
The use of `ExecutionPolicy Restricted` implies a deliberate attempt to reduce the PowerShell execution scope, which doesn't by itself indicate malicious activity but shows cautious execution methods.

### System Logs
The system logs reveal multiple Windows Update-related activities. These updates pertain to various Microsoft components like .NET Native and Microsoft VCLibs libraries. There’s no indication of tampering or abnormal behavior in these events, and they appear to be standard operating system updates.

### Security Logs
Multiple failed attempts to read credentials related to a `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` are logged. The failed readings could suggest attempts to access or validate the Microsoft service; however, the Return Code `3221226021` typically indicates a STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION error, which can occur in various normal operations as well as possible misconfiguration or testing attempts. 

### Sysmon Logs
Several entries mention the execution of common Windows utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, which are not inherently malicious. However, the manner of their execution—preceding a PowerShell command—raises a suspicion about the overall scripting behavior and its potential misuse.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious PowerShell Usage:** The logs indicate executions commonly associated with script-based enumeration and manipulation techniques. They raise suspicions due to the nature of the complex scripts targeting process details.
- **Credential Attempt Alerts:** The unsuccessful credential attempts need further context for potential patterns or misuse concerns but are not outright indicators of compromise.
- **Normal Windows Update Procedures:** These suggest no malicious activity in the update cycle entries.

### Conclusion
The logs show suspicious activity that warrants further investigation due to complex scripting and alignment with potential enumeration tactics typically preparatory for further actions. While no immediate malicious compromise is evident from the data alone, verifying current system integrity and possible actor origins or intentions is advisable.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity seems non-standard and potentially harmful without clear, benign context. More investigation into the origin and intent of the PowerShell commands, as well as the credential access attempts, is recommended."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using Token Manipulation technique,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

### Security Log
1. **EventID 4672 - Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon:** The user `admin_test` was assigned a series of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others which are indicative of administrative capabilities. This is normal for administrative accounts but should be investigated further if the user is not intended to have such privileges.

2. **EventID 4624 - An Account was Successfully Logged On:** The `admin_test` account was successfully logged on using NTLM from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This logon type (Type 3) is typically a network logon, and while not inherently suspicious, requires checking the log and authentication patterns.

### Sysmon Log
3. **Process Creation Events:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by `admin_test` can be routine administrative activities. However, the sequence and pattern, especially without apparent context in the logs, could be worth investigating if they don't correlate with expected behavior from the user or usual system automation.
   - A `PowerShell` script was invoked, downloading and executing a script from an external source using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring`, which is a common technique used by attackers for executing malicious scripts. This specific script (`Get-WinlogonTokenSystem.ps1`) can be used for privilege escalation, indicating potential malicious activity.

### Windows PowerShell Log
4. Numerous entries indicate that a PowerShell session initiated with a command-line including a script download and execution (`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`). This behavior is particularly risky, especially if not pre-authorized or part of legitimate activities like updates or administration tasks by IT administrators.

### Application Log & System Log
5. No immediately suspicious entries were identified in the Application or System logs. These logs indicate routine operation and security software activity (Windows Defender active).

### Summary and Recommendation
- The activity involving downloading and executing a PowerShell script from an external URL is concerning and indicative of possible malicious intent, particularly given the nature of the script which appears to be related to token manipulation/privilege escalation.
- The use of high-privileges and remote logins by `admin_test` could either be legitimate administrative tasks or warrant further examination to ensure that the account is used according to policy and not compromised.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of a potentially malicious PowerShell script execution is a significant red flag. Immediate action is required to investigate the source and intention of this script and whether it resulted in a compromise of the system.
- **Guidance to Proceed:**
  - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
  - Analyze the downloaded script for malicious payloads or functionality.

Domain Password Policy Check: Common Password Use,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided event logs, several areas stand out that warrant further attention due to the nature and pattern of the operations:

#### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The script's goal appears to be managing passwords for the user, storing and potentially altering them based on the logic specified in the script (`Set-ADAccountPassword`).
   - This PowerShell script involves sensitive operations, such as password storage and management. While this can be part of an administrative action, unsanctioned execution could imply potential malicious intent or unauthorized configuration changes.

2. **Pattern of Executed Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of processes tied to system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` show execution under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user within a short timeframe.
   - The quick succession and nature of these process executions, especially involving `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used to query process logs, might indicate an attempt to either gather system logs or erase traces of activities.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of `setup.exe` from Microsoft Edge updates are logged. These appear to be legitimate processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, potentially indicating automatic updates or installations.

4. **Search and System Processes:**
   - Legitimate system processes like `SearchProtocolHost.exe` and `SearchFilterHost.exe` are found executing under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These align with normal system operations for Windows Search functionalities.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - A security event (ID 4799) related to group membership enumeration occurs around the same timeframe, which involves processes linked with the Edge update setup executable. This event itself doesn't directly suggest malicious intent but should be corroborated with other findings.

#### Assessment and Threats:

Based on the detailed examination of the events, there are a few components that raise concerns:
- The PowerShell script execution, with capabilities to manage passwords and a fairly intricate logic flow, is concerning without clear validation of its legitimacy.
- The grouped activities involving `wevtutil.exe` and its potential use to manage or erase logs indicate actions which, if performed without authorization, could represent steps taken within a broader malicious campaign.

#### Conclusion:

Given the nature and execution of these scripts and processes, further investigation into the legitimacy and authorization of these actions is warranted. It is crucial to validate whether these were conducted by an authorized user or administrative process, especially considering the potential for credential manipulation.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Action Items:**
  - Verify the origin and intent of the PowerShell script execution, focusing on its purpose and the necessity for password management.
  - Confirm whether the log management actions (`wevtutil.exe`) were performed as part of expected administrative maintenance.
  - Ensure that all users with administrative access are vetted and no unauthorized users have such privileges.
  - Conduct a thorough review of other network activities and endpoints to assess for broader indicators of compromise."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task,"Upon an in-depth analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities stood out that could potentially indicate malicious behavior:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Event IDs 24 and 1 in the System log indicate multiple time changes within a very short period through `svchost.exe`. Such time adjustments can be suspicious if not authorized and required; they may indicate attempts to bypass time-based security controls or forensic timelines. However, these can also occur during valid operations such as time synchronization but given the context of an alert, it's something to consider.

2. **Execution of PowerShell**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` execution are logged in Sysmon. The command used attempts to register a scheduled task using PowerShell's `Invoke-CimMethod` to interact with Task Scheduler through WMI, reading from an XML file. 
   - The use of scheduled tasks via PowerShell with high integrity level suggests deliberate privilege escalation or persistence attempts.

3. **Usage of High-Privilege Tokens**:
   - The Security log shows `admin_test` with privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are typically only necessary for diagnostic or debugging tasks but can be exploited for malicious purposes.

4. **Anomalous Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon log indicates a series of process creations including `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, etc. between instances of `powershell.exe`. The sequence and combination of these processes can be indicative of an attacker enumerating the system environment, potentially assessing their level of access or gathering system information.

5. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` were observed. This utility can be used to query or clear Windows event logs, potentially indicating an attempt to cover tracks after suspicious activities.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of utility executions, PowerShell scripting with high integrity, frequent time changes, enumeration activities, and the potential alteration or querying of event logs makes the observed behavior suspicious.
  
**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the source and actions of `admin_test`, verifying whether any processes or tasks were unapproved.
- Confirm if the time changes and scheduled task registration were part of a legitimate process.
- Cross-examine other logs from the same timeframe for additional evidence of unauthorized activity, especially related to tasks initiated by PowerShell scripts.
- Ensure temporal integrity by synchronizing time with a trusted time server and examine group policy settings regarding time change permissions.
- Review the necessity and application of privileges associated with the account in question, ensuring permissions adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege.
- Monitor network traffic for potential data exfiltration attempts and evaluate if other systems may have been similarly affected."
Azure AD - adding user to Azure AD role,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**

The PowerShell event logs are showing the execution of a PowerShell script with the following characteristics:
- PowerShell is being used to connect to Azure Active Directory (`Connect-AzureAD`), implying potential cloud-based activity.
- A secure string (`ConvertTo-SecureString`) is used with what appears to be a password in plaintext (`""p4sswd""`) to create a credential object.
- The script attempts to filter and add users to a directory role, specifically aiming to add a user to a 'Global Reader' role.
- The execution of the script is conducted on `Server002` by a user named `admin_test`.

**Suspicious Indicators:**
- The use of plaintext passwords in PowerShell scripts raises immediate concerns about credential handling and potential for misuse.
- Attempting to manipulate Azure AD roles can indicate unauthorized access or privilege escalation, especially when not expected to be part of standard operations.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log Entries:**

In the Sysmon logs, several noteworthy activities are observed:
- **Process Creation Events**:
  - Multiple instances of PowerShell, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `svchost.exe` are executed by the same user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
  - The PowerShell instance (PID 3324) aligns with the script execution noted in the PowerShell logs.
  - `whoami.exe` is being executed, which is often used for reconnaissance to verify current user context and privileges.
- **User Context**:
  - The operations are executed under a high integrity level, which indicates elevated privileges.

**Suspicious Indicators:**
- Frequent invocation of administrative tools and PowerShell in conjunction with high-integrity levels can be indicative of privilege escalation techniques or administrative reconnaissance activities.

#### 3. **Overall Assessment:**

The combination of PowerShell scripting with plaintext credentials and manipulation of Azure AD roles, along with elevated process executions, strongly suggests activities that deviate from normal behavior. This can indicate an attempt to gain unauthorized access or elevate privileges in a cloud environment using potentially compromised credentials.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Credential Vulnerability**: The presence of plaintext passwords in PowerShell scripts poses a significant risk to credential security and data privacy.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access**: The manipulation of Azure AD roles could signify malicious intent to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive data.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Execution of commands at a high integrity level coupled with reconnaissance tools suggests possible privilege escalation endeavors.

### Recommended Next Steps:

- **Immediate Review of Access Logs**: Review Azure and related access logs to determine if unauthorized changes were made to directory roles and confirm whether the suspected user has been compromised.
- **Credential Rotation and Security Hardening**: Urgently rotate any credentials that may have been exposed and assess the implementation of more secure credential handling practices, such as using a secrets manager or encrypted configuration files.
- **Audit and Monitor PowerShell Activities**: Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell activities, especially those related to administrative tasks or script invocation.
- **User and Access Review**: Conduct a thorough review of the privileges assigned to `admin_test` and ensure principle of least privilege is enforced.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs strongly indicate suspicious activity consistent with potential malicious intent such as credential misuse and unauthorized privilege escalation within Azure Active Directory. Immediate action and further investigation are required."
SystemBC Malware-as-a-Service Registry,"Based on the information provided in the various logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Time Changes (Security and System Logs):**
   - In the Security and System logs, there are multiple time change events (`EventID: 4616` and `EventID: 1`, respectively). These events are generated when the system time is changed. While legitimate applications can alter the system time, unexpected time changes can signal attempts to manipulate log records.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (PowerShell Logs):**
   - There are PowerShell log entries indicating the use of a potentially malicious PowerShell command that is altering the Windows registry to create a persistence mechanism. The command is attempting to set a registry key `socks5_powershell` with a value `powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File`, which could hide PowerShell windows and execute scripts with bypassed execution policies, a common tactic used by malware to persist or execute payloads unnoticed.
   
3. **Unexpected and Continuous Use of System Utilities (Sysmon Logs):**
   - The frequent and consecutive execution of `wevtutil` and `conhost` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` could suggest attempts to interact with event logs or utilize console hosts in a manner not typical for standard users. `wevtutil` is often used for managing Windows event logs, which can include clearing, querying, or exporting logs.

4. **Edge Update Executions (Sysmon and Application Logs):**
   - Continuous executions related to Microsoft Edge update processes are noticed. While these could be legitimate updates or checks, they are noteworthy due to the timing and frequency. The entries involved different executables from Edge Update (`Install`, `Setup`, and other components) executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is typical for system processes but warrants scrutiny in the broader context.

### Assessment:

- The most glaringly suspicious activity is the use of PowerShell to set persistence via the registry, combined with execution policy bypass. Such actions are indicative of potential compromise rather than a legitimate admin task.
- Frequent manipulation and execution of system utilities can further signal attempts to cover tracks or prepare the environment for further exploitation or persistence.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- **Potential malware persistence** via unauthorized registry changes using PowerShell. This specific method (execution of a hidden PowerShell script with bypassed execution policy) is commonly associated with malicious actors attempting to establish continuous access or retain execution capabilities between reboots.
- **Possible tampering with log files** or system time to obfuscate activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- Immediately investigate the suspicious PowerShell activity to determine whether a compromise has occurred. Review the contents of the script intended for execution and check the integrity of the system's registry related to the specified keys.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the machine to identify any potential malware present and assess any unauthorized changes or configurations.
- Review user privileges and any recent changes to user rights or permissions that may have allowed such activity.
- Monitor the network for any unusual or unauthorized outbound connections, which could indicate data exfiltration attempts or command and control activity.
- Ensure all systems and antivirus definitions are up-to-date and perform comprehensive scans on the host and nearby assets.
- Consider isolating the machine from the network if malicious activity is confirmed, until a full investigation is complete.

### Resolution:

The logs suggest MALICIOUS activity, specifically the use of PowerShell for setting up persistence mechanisms, indicating potential malware activity. Immediate action is recommended to investigate and remediate any confirmed threats."
Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious Behavior Identified

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script to create a new scheduled task that runs `calc.exe` at user logon, with elevated privileges under the ""BUILTIN\\Administrators"" group. This type of behavior is typical for a persistence mechanism often employed by malware.

    - **Command**: `New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute ""calc.exe""`, `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtLogon`, `New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -GroupId ""BUILTIN\\Administrators"" -RunLevel Highest`.
    - The use of `calc.exe` might be obfuscation to avoid detection, as it is a benign application typically present in Windows systems.

2. **Sysmon Events**: Multiple Sysmon events capture the execution of PowerShell and various system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 

    - **Process Hierarchy**: The parent process for suspicious PowerShell activities was `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process but can be misused if compromised.

    - **Privilege Level**: Observed activities are performed at a high integrity level, implying elevated privileges.

3. **Command Line Execution**: The explicit PowerShell command to create a scheduled task is highly unusual and not typically seen in normal system administration unless meant for automation scripts but even then, it would be diligently documented and controlled.

#### Other Notable Activities

1. **Microsoft Edge Installer Execution**: The Sysmon logs show operations related to Microsoft Edge updates being processed by the system. This activity appears benign and consistent with legitimate software maintenance.

#### Threat Assessment

- The creation of a scheduled task through a PowerShell script, especially with elevated privileges, is a significant indicator of compromise. While `calc.exe` in itself is harmless, this technique can be exploited with different payloads.

#### Actionable Guidance

- **Immediate Response**: Flag this host for detailed forensic analysis to examine the full context and origin of suspicious PowerShell commands.
- **Review Scheduled Tasks**: Verify all scheduled tasks on the host for unauthorized entries and remove any unauthorized or suspicious tasks.
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Investigate the recent activities and login sessions of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine if the account has been compromised.
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of a script creating a potentially harmful scheduled task with elevated privileges strongly suggests malicious intent. Further investigation is warranted to assess the full extent of the compromise and prevent further impact."
Suspicious bat file run from startup Folder,"Based on the provided log entries, the following observations can be made:

### Analysis of Log Entries

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are executed, which are rather normal for system administration tasks. However, the frequency and the context in which they appear, such as executions by the `admin_test` user, could be noteworthy depending on the environment and recent activities. 

2. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility used to manage event logs. While it can be used legitimately, repeated or unexpected usage on a high-level user’s machine without obvious administrative activity might indicate an attempt to clear or modify event logs to cover tracks.

3. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - The execution of PowerShell commands that include `Copy-Item` and `Start-Process` to place a batch file (`batstartup.bat`) in the startup directory is highly suspicious. This behavior is characteristic of a persistence mechanism often used by malicious actors to ensure their payload runs on system startup.
   - The commands attempt to copy and execute items in both user-specific and system-wide startup directories, suggesting an effort to maintain persistence across reboots and potentially affect multiple user accounts.

4. **Time Change Event**:
   - The security log shows that the system time was altered. Changes to the system time by unauthorized means could be a method used by attackers to influence log file timestamps and impede investigations.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Suspicious Activities Identified**:
  - The PowerShell command execution, particularly involving startup directories, is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity.
  - While actions by `admin_test` could be authorized and part of routine administrative tasks, the context in which these tools were used, combined with the timestamp changes and methodical attempts of copying scripts to startup folders, increases the suspicion level.

### Guidance and Next Steps

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity within these logs warrants further investigation. Although there is strong evidence suggesting potential compromise, without corroborating evidence from other sources or direct system access, immediate labeling as malicious may be premature.
  
- **Recommended Actions**:
  1. **Review Recent Changes**: Check for recent changes on the system, access policies and any new software installations, or unknown scheduled tasks.
  2. **Forensic Analysis**: A forensic analysis should be performed on the affected machine to understand the extent of the activity and determine the presence of any additional malware or unauthorized tools.
  3. **User Verification**: Contact the user or administrator (`admin_test`) to validate whether the activities recorded were legitimate actions taken by them.
  4. **Audit and Monitor**: Increase monitoring on this and other critical systems, especially focusing on PowerShell activity and changes to the startup folder and scheduled tasks.
  5. **Security Controls Review**: Ensure that appropriate security controls, such as EDR and auditing policies, are in place and correctly configured to capture critical events. Consider implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies.
  6. **Potential Incident Response**: If further evidence of compromise is found, initiate incident response protocols to contain and remediate the situation."
Add persistance via Recycle bin,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, a few notable observations and potential indicators of suspicious activity were identified. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Registry Modification Attempt:**
   - A Sysmon event captured the execution of `cmd.exe` with the following command:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg ADD ""HKCR\CLSID\{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}\shell\open\command"" /ve /d ""calc.exe"" /f
     ```
   - This command attempts to modify the registry to change the default command of a shell command, which is a common persistence mechanism or may be used to execute arbitrary commands when certain user actions occur, such as opening the recycle bin.

2. **Process Execution Chain:**
   - Multiple processes executed consecutively, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their execution pattern and timing might suggest script execution or automated tasks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are several `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes executed with various command-line parameters. Frequent system-level Edge update operations, while potential regular updates, should be examined further to confirm legitimacy and ensure no exploitation of the update process.

### Events Indicating Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- **Registry Command:**
  - The registry modification command is highly suspicious because altering registry to invoke programs like `calc.exe` typically indicates an attempt to hijack system operations for unwanted purposes. This suggests potential malicious intent or a misconfiguration.

### Assessment, Threats, and Risks Identified:
- The registry modification attempt is a direct indicator of potentially malicious activity, as it could change user or system behavior without their knowledge.
- The pattern and frequency of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated files suggest the need for a deeper examination of update service integrity and source of these update attempts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate Registry Changes:**
   - Check for any current and past registry changes matching the logged modification attempt to assess what has been altered in the system.
   - Restore any unauthorized or suspicious changes, ensuring registry entries conform to standard configurations.

2. **Examine Edge Update:**
   - Verify that the Microsoft Edge updates are coming from legitimate sources and are necessary.
   - Consider temporarily disabling the automatic update service until the source and integrity of updates are confirmed.

3. **Conduct a Comprehensive Threat Hunt:**
   - Conduct a thorough internal review of any other systems using similar configurations.
   - Apply additional logging and monitoring across the environment to capture any similar patterns or further indicators of compromise.

4. **Review and Enhance Security Measures:**
   - Implement stricter controls on command and script execution, especially for administrative users.

5. **Notify and Prepare Incident Response:**
   - Alert the appropriate IT and security teams to verify systems for further threats.
   - Prepare an incident response in case the suspicious activity correlates with other reported events in the organization.

Given the findings, the resolution for this log analysis would be classified as **MALICIOUS** due to the registry modification attempt and unusual processes warranting immediate investigation and remediation actions."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Number in Password,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**System Log Analysis:**
- The events logged are related to Windows updates, showing entries for updates such as ""Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00"" and ""MicrosoftWindows.CrossDevice"". These are routine system updates, and no signs of malicious activity are evident in these entries. All logged events are updates executed by `WindowsUpdateClient`, which is a standard process for system updates.

**Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- The PowerShell events display an execution script designed to change a user password. A script retrieves stored credentials, compares them, and attempts to update user passwords. This operation can have legitimate use cases; however, given its execution on the CEO’s machine, it requires further scrutiny:
  - The command involved storing credentials in a file, which could potentially point to improper handling or storage of sensitive information.
  - The script checks if the current password is the same as the stored one, providing an opportunity for potential misuse or credential theft.
  - Despite this, no explicit malicious actions are detected, primarily because the script does not demonstrate any unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Sysmon captured several process executions, notably the execution of PowerShell from the observed script, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. Notable observations include:
  - A PowerShell command linked to credential management, consistent with the entries in the PowerShell logs.
  - `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Host) operations are routine and correspond with typical command-line activities. However, the frequency and timing of executions merit additional investigation to rule out if they are being leveraged for unauthorized activity.
  - The sequence of commands includes processes typically used in scripting, such as `whoami.exe`, which suggests attempts to verify user context. This could indicate user reconnaissance but is not inherently malicious.

### Threat Assessment:
- **Credential Handling**: Storing user credentials in a file (`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\file\\$env:USERNAME.txt`) can pose a security risk if improperly managed. There is no evidence of this leading to unauthorized access, but it represents a potential vector for intrusion if exploited.
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: The automated password change attempt suggests potential automation within the environment. It could be associated with a legitimate administrative task or indicative of suspicious activity needing further exploration.

### Conclusion:
Upon reviewing the logs, there are signs of unusual behavior, primarily focusing on the use of PowerShell scripts for credential management. This scripting method, though not inherently malicious, can mirror tactics used in malicious activities such as privilege escalation or lateral movement if executed by unauthorized parties or with ill intent. However, the intention behind this action is not immediately clear from the logs alone.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logged activities are suspicious, particularly the password management script execution on the CEO’s machine. It requires a more detailed investigation to confirm the legitimacy of the activities and ensure no unauthorized credential access or changes have occurred. Follow-up actions should involve reviewing who executed the script, why it was initiated, and ensuring that no unauthorized changes to privilege or access happened.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Investigate Usage of PowerShell Script**: Ascertain the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script, identifying if it aligns with known administrative processes.
2. **Verify Credential Storage Practices**: Ensure that credentials are not stored insecurely, posing a potential security risk if accessed by unauthorized entities.
3. **Log Review and Monitoring**: Continuously monitor for similar patterns, especially scripts involving credential changes, and set alerts for unusual PowerShell activities.
4. **User Awareness**: Educate users, particularly those with privileged access, on secure credential management practices and recognize signs of potential misuse."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the analysis reveals the following:

### Observations:
1. **PowerShell Script Usage**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell activity logged. A particular command involves the execution of PowerShell with a script that starts `notepad.exe` and then uses `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` with a `Start-Sleep 10` command. This behavior may be used to chain process execution or utilize delay tactics, which can be indicative of obfuscation attempts.

2. **Frequent Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This frequent execution of system utilities in a short time frame (milliseconds apart) can be considered unusual and could potentially indicate an automated task or script.

3. **Unclear Context and Missing Logs**:
   - The security and system logs are missing which are crucial for understanding account logins, privilege changes, and security policy modifications. The absence of these logs limits the investigation, making it harder to correlate suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
- The combination of PowerShell script execution with the process chaining attempts and rapid fire system utility executions suggests activity that is **unusual** and potentially indicative of a recon phase in a cyber attack lifecycle.
- There is no clear evidence of malware without further context, but the activities align with those that could be used for further malicious actions, specifically script-based attacks where system utilities are weaponized.

### Potential Risks:
- **Privilege Escalation**: Although not explicitly visible in the logs, PowerShell scripts can be used to attempt privilege escalation.
- **Data Exfiltration** or reconnaissance activity using built-in utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` to gather system information.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Acquire any additional logs, especially Security logs, to check for any unauthorized or failed logins and privilege escalation attempts.
   - Check for any security alerts that coincide with the timestamps of these logs for additional context.
   
2. **Audit PowerShell Usage**:
   - Review PowerShell execution policy settings, use Script Block Logging, and Module Logging to capture scripts run on the system.
   
3. **User Activity Monitoring**:
   - Examine `admin_test` user activity for any deviations from normal behavior, check if this user account has been compromised.

4. **Network Traffic Analysis**:
   - Monitor the network traffic from Server002 during this timeframe for any anomalous or unexpected activity.

### Conclusion:
Given the current findings from these logs, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. There is activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation. While no direct evidence of maliciousness is confirmed, the indicators suggest potential misuse of scripting and system utilities that require further investigation."
Winlogon Notify Key Logon Persistence - PowerShell,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

1. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - Multiple instances of a PowerShell command script are observed modifying registry keys under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Notify\file`.
   - These changes include setting DLL paths and functions (`DllName` set to `C:\Windows\Temp\fileNotificationPackage.dll` and `Logon` function to `fileTestFunction`), and modifying notification properties (`Impersonate` to 1 and `Asynchronous` to 0).
   - The use of `Winlogon\Notify` with custom DLLs can be an indicator of persistence mechanisms exploited by malware to execute during user logon.

#### Security Log:

- Events recorded are standard time change events conducted by the `svchost.exe`, operating under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. There is no direct evidence linking these changes to any compromise or malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **Process Execution Observations:**
  - Instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are executed under the `admin_test` user.
  - **PowerShell Execution**: Matches the suspicious PowerShell execution details noted in the PowerShell logs, indicating actions conducted from a PowerShell initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`.
  - **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` within a short timeframe**: Could be used for malicious log cleansing or querying. Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` in conjunction with other typically benign processes (like `conhost.exe`) may suggest an investigation to understand intent.

#### System and Application Logs:

- Normal time synchronization events are noted, possibly due to standard Windows operations ensuring time integrity or correction.
- No significant anomalies or additional indicators of compromise are found in the system or application logs beyond regular system operations and temporal adjustments.

### Conclusion:

**Assessment:**

- The PowerShell activities modifying registry entries for persistence, especially involving `Winlogon\Notify`, are not typical behavior for regular system operations and can be indicative of malicious activity aimed at persistence and unauthorized code execution on system startup.
- The combination of registry persistence techniques, usage of administrative or high-integrity processes, and no immediately evident benign use case elevates the risk level. Further scrutiny is warranted to discern intent and potentially identify other indicators of compromise in the environment or network.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.

Simulate - Post BEC persistence via user password reset followed by user added to company administrator role,"After analyzing the provided log entries across different log sources, the following findings are noted:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
    - There is a scheduled operation for updating Microsoft Edge, recognizable by the execution of the setup.exe installer at the system level, using System integrity level.
    - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` initiated by the user `admin_test`. Although `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to work with event logs, excessive or repeated execution within a short period can indicate deletion or tampering attempts with logs.
    - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` with a command script executed by the `admin_test` user, indicating potential administrative activities.
    - The PowerShell script contains operations interacting with Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) and Microsoft Online (MSOnline) services, such as resetting user passwords and changing roles (Company Administrator, Global Reader). This indicates possible unauthorized administrative actions within Azure environments.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**
    - The logs corroborate the Sysmon findings, revealing detailed PowerShell commands associated with the operations involving Azure accounts, which include password changes and role modifications.

3. **Security Logs:**
    - Multiple events list the process `CompatTelRunner.exe` running, querying several user accounts and groups. This might be a telemetry operation, but it can also be used for reconnaissance to identify accounts and permissions within the system, which can be suspicious.

4. **Application and Other Logs:**
    - Entries related to the Microsoft Software Protection Platform and general telemetry (`CompatTelRunner.exe`) indicate standard Windows operations; however, when aligned with the broader picture, these entries could be used to mask malicious activities.

**Suspicious Indicators Identified:**
- PowerShell scripts handling sensitive changes in AzureAD (resetting passwords, modifying user roles), particularly associated with non-interactive sessions and scripts executed from temporary directories.
- High-intensity usage of administrative utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `whoami.exe`) which could signify log tampering, privilege escalation, or account reconnaissance.

### Final Assessment:
- This combination of activities, especially the PowerShell script that interacts with AzureAD and makes unauthorized changes, represents a significant security threat.
- The sequence of telemetry processes querying user accounts and groups further indicates abnormal activities concerning user management.

### Conclusion:
The logs exhibit clear signs of a likely compromise involving unauthorized manipulation of Azure roles and potential efforts to cover tracks through excessive logging operations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Audit Azure roles and accounts to rectify unauthorized changes and reset affected accounts immediately.
- Initiate a thorough investigation to determine how the attacker gained access to execute these scripts.
- Analyze other potentially affected systems for similar activities, as this could indicate a broader campaign.
- Enhance monitoring and logging across the environment to detect and respond to such activities promptly in the future."
Modify Service to Run Arbitrary Binary (Powershell),"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, I have identified the following:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs exhibit a command where the binary path of the `Fax` service is modified to execute `notepad.exe`. The command `powershell.exe & {Stop-Service -Name ""fax"" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue | Out-Null; set-servicebinarypath -name ""fax"" -path ""$env:windir\\system32\\notepad.exe""; start-service -Name ""fax"" -erroraction silentlycontinue | out-null}` indicates manipulation of service paths, which is a known tactic used in privilege escalation attacks or persistence mechanisms.

2. **Service Manipulation**:
   - Changing the binary path of a service (`Fax`) to another executable (in this case, `notepad.exe`) is anomalous and does not align with typical administrative practices. This action may indicate an attempt to mislead or redirect expected service behavior to a non-standard executable.

3. **Process and User Context**:
   - The Sysmon logs show that this activity was executed under a user identified as `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level. The presence of commands in a high integrity context, especially involving service manipulation, increases the potential risk of malicious activity.

### Potential Risks:
- **Privilege Escalation**: The manipulation of service paths is a clear sign of potential attacks aimed at privilege escalation. If a less privileged user manages to tweak service paths and run arbitrary executables, it poses a significant security threat.
  
- **Persistence**: Altering service behavior can serve as a persistence mechanism, maintaining malicious foothold within the system by utilizing standard services.

### Assessment and Resolution:
The observed activity involving the modification of a Windows service binary path is highly indicative of malicious intent, likely for privilege escalation or persistence. The use of scripted commands to modify and restart services is concerning and aligns with known adversarial techniques.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or further compromise.

2. **Service Path Restoration**: Revert the service path of the `Fax` service to its legitimate binary and investigate whether other services have been similarly altered.

3. **Thorough Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify the full scope of the compromise.

4. **User Account Scrutiny**: Review actions and privileges associated with the user `admin_test` to verify account integrity and possible misuse.

5. **Patch & Harden**: Ensure all systems are fully patched and hardened against similar privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

Final Finding: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive indicators of malicious activity with likely intent for privilege escalation or persistence. Immediate action is required to mitigate the threat."
Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events that indicate the execution of a PowerShell script. The command involves reading an XML file from ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.005\src\data_05_SCTASK_HIDDEN_ATTRIB.xml"" and using the `Invoke-CimMethod` to register a scheduled task by XML using the `PS_ScheduledTask` class.
   - These actions are performed using the `Force` parameter which might imply overwriting existing configurations without prompt. The use of temporary paths and hidden task registration is a red flag for suspicious activity, often associated with persistence mechanisms used by malware.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of several processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Notable processes include:
     - `powershell.exe` executing from the `System32` directory with a suspicious command line that matches the PowerShell activity noted above.
     - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`. These tools by themselves are not malicious, but `wevtutil.exe` can be used for log manipulation, which can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` accounts, such as `sppsvc.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` are normal system activities, but should be examined in the context of this case.

3. **Application Log:**
   - The Application log refers to the Software Protection Platform starting, which is typically benign unless correlated with known malicious behavior.

4. **Risk and Threats:**
   - The significant threat here is the creation of a scheduled task using PowerShell, which is a common technique for establishing persistence on a system.
   - The use of temporary file paths and the potential to execute hidden or overwritten tasks raises the concern that this could be part of a larger attack framework or malware attempting to ensure it survives reboots.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- There is evidence of potentially suspicious PowerShell usage to register a scheduled task, which is a common tactic used by adversaries to maintain persistence.
- The combination of executing these commands under an admin user account and the unexplained registration of a task by XML without clear necessity raises immediate security concerns.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Analyze the XML file referenced in the PowerShell execution to determine its contents and intended actions.
- Investigate the system for any other indicators of compromise, such as unusual network traffic, file changes, or unexpected system behaviors.
- Review scheduled tasks on the system to identify any unauthorized tasks, particularly those matching the timestamp and user from the PowerShell logs.
- Conduct a threat hunt across other systems in the network to identify if similar activity is present elsewhere.
  
**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activity observed in the logs is anomalous and suspicious, suggesting potential compromise or misconfiguration that requires further investigation to determine intent and potential impact."
Shortcut Modification,"Based on the provided logs, several points stand out that warrant attention:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The Windows Security logs (EventID 4616) and System logs (EventID 1, 24) indicate that there are multiple instances of time changes on the system. The `NewTime` is set earlier than the `OldTime`, which is uncommon and could be a sign of tampering to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A Sysmon log entry shows execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that attempts to create a URL file pointing to `calc.exe`:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c echo [InternetShortcut] > %%temp%%\data.009_modified_shortcut.url & echo URL=C:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe >> %%temp%%\data.009_modified_shortcut.url & %%temp%%\data.009_modified_shortcut.url
     ```
   This activity could be an indicator of an attempt to create a shortcut to execute the Calculator, which, being a benign application, can occasionally be leveraged in attacks to test payload execution.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a utility that can be used to manage event logs. Such tool usage could suggest attempts to query, clear, or modify event logs, particularly if observed in scripts or unusual contexts.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These tools are often used for reconnaissance purposes. Frequent execution of these tools could indicate an intruder trying to gather system information.

5. **Edge Update Process:**
   - There are multiple entries related to Edge Update tool (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components). While these update processes are common, the unusually high number of operations in a short time span is worth noting but isn't inherently malicious without additional context.

### Assessment:

The combination of time manipulation, suspicious command execution involving shortcut creation to use `calc.exe`, frequent reconnaissance tool executions, and event log management tool usage points towards potentially nefarious activity. While none of the activities alone conclusively indicate a compromise, the pattern raises significant suspicion.

### Recommendation:

Given these observations, this situation is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. It requires further investigation to confirm whether this activity is benign or part of a larger malicious intent:

- Conduct a detailed review of the `cmd.exe` commands and the resultant URL files to verify any potential payloads or activities.
- Investigate the purpose and origin of the time adjustments and determine if they correlate with potentially malicious actions.
- Analyze user activity, especially for the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, to understand the intent and context of these actions.
- Monitor for any further anomalous behaviors or patterns that might indicate malicious intentions.
- Consider initiating a full endpoint review for known Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and assess the security posture and response measures.
"
`SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals the following:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script is being executed with a highly suspicious command line that indicates a possible attempt to download and execute a script from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/script.ps1`). The usage of `IEX (IWR ...)` is a known technique for downloading and executing scripts directly from the web, often used in malicious activities such as privilege escalation attacks. (EventRecordID 17976, 1043, 1044, etc.)

2. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is used to manage event logs, is executed multiple times. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate utility, its execution in quick succession may indicate log tampering or clearing attempts, which are potential signs of malicious activity. (EventRecordID 17950, 17954, 17958, 17962, 17966)

3. **Unusual Time Change**:
   - Several entries show changes in system time (`EventID: 4616`, `EventID: 1`) which can be an indication of tampering or manipulation attempts. Adjusting system time can be used to circumvent security controls or forensic timelines.

4. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The frequent execution of `conhost.exe` related to processes such as `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` may suggest command-line operations intended to gather system information or control terminal interfaces, but the context aligns with the potentially suspicious activity noted with PowerShell.

### Assessment and Risk:

The pattern of process executions, combined with the suspicious PowerShell activity, indicates behaviors consistent with malicious attempts to perform activities such as privilege escalation, information gathering, or covering tracks through event log manipulation. The elements of command-line utility usage, PowerShell script execution from a remote source, and potential date-time changes are strong indicators.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the machine `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise, including any changes made by the script downloaded via PowerShell.
   - Verify the integrity of the system time settings and review any discrepancies.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Examine the PowerShell scripts and downloaded content for malicious payloads or backdoors.
   - Check for any additional malicious files, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movements.
   - Analyze network traffic from the server to identify any unauthorized outbound connections.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Remove any identified malware or unauthorized tools.
   - Reinforce endpoint security measures, including blocking known malicious command-line patterns.
   - Apply patches and security updates, especially focused on PowerShell constraints and event log protections.

### Conclusion:

The logs indicate clear signs of potential malicious activity. This case is finalized as **MALICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to identify the full impact and ensure appropriate remediation."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW WinAPI,"Based on the provided log entries, I'll conduct an analysis to identify any suspicious or malicious activity.

### System Log Analysis
- **Time Change Events (Event ID 1 and 24)**: The logs indicate several time changes, implying potential time manipulation. Time manipulation can be a tactic used to evade detection by altering log timestamps. However, these changes seem to be associated with the Windows Time Service and the `svchost.exe` process, which is typical for legitimate system operations related to time synchronization. 

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Executions with Elevated Privileges**: The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these logs alone don't inherently suggest malicious activity, the repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is commonly used for exporting logs, could indicate log tampering or information gathering. However, no suspicious command-line arguments are present in the entries.
- **Execution of `powershell.exe`**: A PowerShell script was executed from a temporary location (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\x64\CreateProcess.exe`). This execution is highly suspicious as it uses PowerShell to execute `CreateProcess.exe` with `werfault.exe`, typically associated with error reporting. Creating processes in this manner from a temporary directory may indicate a payload being run.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- The PowerShell logs reflect the execution of a command using a temporary directory, which aligns with Sysmon observations. The command seems crafted for execution (`CreateProcess.exe`) from a path that is not typically associated with regular system operation, suggesting potential malicious activity.

### Application Log Analysis
- **Software Protection Platform Event (Event ID 16384)**: One entry with basic information is related to the Software Protection Platform, which doesn't immediately indicate malicious activity.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Privilege Escalation (Event ID 4672)**: The entry indicates that user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be indicative of potential privilege escalation tactics if used maliciously.
- **NTLM Authentication** (Event ID 4624): Authentication using NTLM was logged, showing a logon from a remote workstation. NTLM usage, especially from a non-standard workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P), can be indicative of lateral movement attempts if not expected.

### Assessment
- The evidence indicates suspicious activity primarily focused around unusual processes initiated by the user `admin_test`. The use of PowerShell from a temporary location and the high privileges obtained warrant further investigation due to potential risks of privilege escalation and lateral movement. While the time changes might be benign, they could be correlated with this activity.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that is suspicious and needs more in-depth investigation. The PowerShell execution triggers concern, and the elevated privileges could pose security risks.

### Guidance
- Conduct a thorough investigation on the machine `Server002` focusing on the user `admin_test`.
- Verify if the use of PowerShell and `CreateProcess.exe` in the specified path is legitimate.
- Check for any unauthorized software installations or processes.
- Review network logs for any unauthorized access or unusual traffic patterns.
- Consider disabling or restricting high privileges for `admin_test` if not required.
- Embark on a hunt for any indicators of compromise related to the potentially malicious behavior observed."
Winlogon HKLM Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis:

Based on the provided event logs from different sources on the Windows host, the investigation focuses on determining whether there are indications of suspicious or malicious activities. Here are the findings categorized by log type:

#### Application Log:
- **Software Protection Platform Service** logged an event with EventID 16384. This is a regular activity related to software licensing and does not indicate any suspicious behavior.

#### System Log:
- **Kernel-General Events** (EventID 24 and 1) indicate adjustments to the system time, but the reason provided is consistent with system operations related to time synchronization and do not appear suspicious.
- **Time-Service Event** shows the chosen time source, which is a normal operation for NTP servers synchronized by the Windows Time Service.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- PowerShell execution reflects a command attempting to modify the Windows shell properties. The command sets the Shell registry key to `""explorer.exe, C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe""`, which is highly suspicious. This activity suggests a potential attempt to alter the default shell behavior, possibly for persistence or privilege escalation.

#### Sysmon Log:
- Multiple Sysmon events (EventID 1 and 5) track process creations and file hashes. Within these:
  - **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** executions are noted, which are native Windows processes often used for legitimate purposes.
  - Execution of **whoami.exe**, **hostname.exe**, and **powershell.exe** does not appear inherently malicious, but considering the suspicious PowerShell activity, the context suggests potential misuse.
  - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** execution with a parent process ID of zero indicates a scheduled task or service execution, which is typical for update services.
  
#### Security Log:
- **Security-Auditing Events** (EventID 4616) capture time change events by the local service account using svchost.exe. This activity, in the absence of further anomalies, aligns with typical system time adjustments.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The key indicator of potential compromise is the modification attempt of the shell registry key by PowerShell. Such changes are not standard practice and may indicate an attempted persistence mechanism or unauthorized system change. The execution context of PowerShell with the command involving registry editing is a notable risk.

### Identified Threats/Risks:
- **Persistence Mechanism**: Altering the shell system setting could allow for unauthorized code execution upon user login.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation/Initial Access**: Such registry changes can be indicative of unauthorized access seeking to maintain persistence on the host.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct deeper investigations into the source of the PowerShell command, assessing the user/actor that executed it.
- **Containment**: If unauthorized, revert the registry changes promptly and assess for further unauthorized alterations or indicators of compromise.

**MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of the PowerShell alteration and its context, this event reflects likely malicious activity warranting immediate attention and remediation steps."
Reg Key Run,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Synchronization Events**:
   - System log entries indicate several time synchronization events by the `svchost.exe` process. These are typical Windows time adjustments and do not inherently indicate malicious behavior. However, time manipulation can sometimes be leveraged by malware to evade detection or trigger specific actions.
   
2. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple Sysmon log entries show the execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are legitimate Windows utilities, but their usage context is crucial. For instance:
     - The `cmd.exe` process runs a command attempting to add a registry key to `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. This could be an attempt to establish persistence by adding a scheduled task or a startup item.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - The Sysmon logs capture `cmd.exe` executing a command to add a registry entry via `reg.exe`. This behavior can potentially indicate malicious activity, especially if it's unexpected or without legitimate administrative intent. This is a classical technique used for persistence by malware.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Several processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and particularly `cmd.exe` with modifying registry, are executed with High integrity levels under the `admin_test` user. This might suggest an elevated privilege or administrative access used in these actions.

5. **User Context**:
   - All suspicious activities, including the registry modifications, were conducted under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. It's important to validate if this user account's actions are justified within the organizational context.

### Conclusions:

- **Suspicious Activity**:
  - The act of adding an entry to the Windows startup registry key, especially in an unexpected context such as `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`, is a red flag. This is a common persistence method used by malicious actors.

- **General Tools Observed**:
  - Usage of legitimate Windows utilities was noted. However, without context, these could be used either benignly or maliciously.

### Resolution:

The overall activities, particularly the registry modifications under administrative access, suggest potentially unauthorized persistence mechanisms being established.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Validate the legitimacy of actions taken under the `admin_test` account.
   - Investigate the source and intent of the registry changes.
   - Review recent activities of the `admin_test` user for anomalies or deviations from regular behavior.

2. **Consideration for Remediation**:
   - If unauthorized changes are confirmed, remediate by reverting registry modifications and reviewing startup items.
   - Conduct a comprehensive scan for malware and other indicators of compromise on `Server002`.

3. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Observe network activity for any unusual external connections or data exfiltration following the suspicious activities.

4. **User Awareness**:
   - Ensure that users are educated about security best practices and the implications of executing scripts or unauthorized changes.

Proceeding with due diligence can uncover more evidence to ascertain if the behavior was part of a malicious operation or an administrative error."
HKLM - re-execute Internet Explorer Core Fonts' StubPath payload by decreasing version number,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be drawn:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: The logs show numerous instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These binaries are commonly used in administrative tasks and can sometimes be involved in malicious activities such as logging tampering or reconnaissance, particularly if run frequently or unexpectedly.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a PowerShell script executing commands to alter registry settings (particularly `Set-ItemProperty` targeting `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components`). Such modifications can be an attempt to persist or execute unauthorized actions.

3. **Unusual Time Reversion**: The system clock was set back slightly in a security event (`EventID 4616`). This behavior is suspicious as attackers may attempt to manipulate timestamps to cover tracks, align timestamps for execution, or circumvent certain time-based security mechanisms.

4. **Frequent Execution and Updates on Edge Processes**: Multiple log entries relate to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`. This could indicate regular updates, but the volume and frequency should be evaluated to ensure these are legitimate and not a cover for malicious activity.

5. **Execution Context and Integrity Level**: The integrity levels for potentially concerning processes such as powershell.exe are ""High,"" which suggests they have elevated privileges. This increases the potential risk of their use in a malicious context.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: The usage patterns of PowerShell to modify registry settings, frequent usage of system utilities, and system time manipulation stand out as suspicious activities. These behaviors align with tactics commonly used in intrusion scenarios, such as privilege escalation, persistence, and obfuscation.

- **Potential Risks**: There is a potential risk that these activities are malicious. The use of PowerShell and registry alterations without clear context could suggest an attempt to bypass user controls or create persistence mechanisms. The alteration of system time further raises concern.

### Conclusion

Based on the above analysis, the resolution is:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs show behaviors that warrant further detailed investigation to ascertain their intent. Although they do not unequivocally indicate malicious activity, the patterns observed are not typical for regular user or system operations, especially on the CEO's machine.

2. **Verify Processes**: Check `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell scripts for recent modifications and verify the executables via a hash check against known trusted versions.

3. **Examine Logs Further**: Review prior and subsequent events for the EDR alert and any correlating logs for similar behavior. Cross-reference with network logs to detect any external communications during these events.

4. **User Awareness and Access Control**: Ensure that the `admin_test` account usage is legitimate, and there isn't any misuse or credential compromise.

5. **Implement Monitoring**: Establish or enhance monitoring for unauthorized changes to such sensitive registry keys and unusual system time changes.

By proceeding with these measures, you can help mitigate risk and better understand the potential threat landscape presented by these findings."
Authentication Package,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the logs provided from the Windows event log files, several suspicious activities were identified. Below is a breakdown of the notable findings and an assessment of the situation:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed to copy a potentially malicious DLL (`package.dll`) to the system directory and modify the system registry under the authentication packages. The command is: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Copy-Item \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\package.dll\"" C:\\Windows\\System32\\, reg add \""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa\"" /v \""Authentication Packages\"" /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d \""msv1_0\\0package.dll\"" /f}
     ```
   - This command suggests an attempt to introduce a new authentication package DLL, which is a common technique used for backdoor creation or privilege escalation.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - The use of the `reg.exe` command confirms the registry modification attempt:
     ```
     reg.exe add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /v ""Authentication Packages"" /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d msv1_0\0package.dll /f
     ```
   - Modifying the ""Authentication Packages"" registry value is a critical action as it affects Windows authentication mechanisms.

3. **High Privilege Activity**:
   - The `admin_test` account executed activities with highly privileged rights, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, among others. These privileges can be exploited for system-wide control.

4. **Indicators of Compromise**:
   - The observed activities, including executing unauthorized PowerShell scripts, modifying critical registry entries, and the use of administrative privileges, strongly suggest malicious intent.

### Conclusion and Recommendation

Given the nature of the activities—unauthorized file copying into system directories and modifying sensitive registry settings associated with authentication—the evidence points towards a potential compromise involving privilege escalation and backdoor installations. The logs show an actor performing activities that have significant security implications.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

This incident highlights the critical need for proactive security measures and real-time monitoring to detect and respond to potential threats quickly."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be made:

### Events of Interest:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell command executed that modifies registry settings related to `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System` to set various group policy refresh times and the SmartScreen settings to 0. This action could indicate an attempt to manipulate system policies and disable security features like SmartScreen, which is considered suspicious.
   - The command is executed within the context of an elevated session (`IntegrityLevel: High`) under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is often used to clear or export event logs, which could mean someone is trying to cover their tracks or access detailed event logs without proper authorization.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are run by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, possibly to gather system and user information.
   - It's unusual for a legitimate admin tasking to involve this frequency and combination of Windows utilities rapidly in succession, especially under a potentially new or unfamiliar account like `admin_test`.

3. **Account Enumeration**:
   - Several events (ID 4798) indicate account enumeration activities, where different user accounts on the server (`Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, `lplui`) are being queried through the `taskhostw.exe`. This could be part of reconnaissance attempts to identify potential accounts to exploit or move laterally within the network.

4. **Time Changes**:
   - There are events related to time changes (`EventID 4616`) made by `svchost.exe`. While time changes may happen for numerous benign reasons like daylight saving adjustments, combined with other suspicious activity, it warrants attention.

### Analysis:
- The PowerShell activity for modifying policies and disabling SmartScreen suggests potential system misconfiguration or malicious intent.
- `wevtutil.exe` usage might be an attempt to tamper with event logs, which indicates potential malicious activity or data exfiltration preparation.
- Frequent short-burst activities of executing system information gathering commands (`whoami`, `hostname`) can suggest an attacker trying to quickly gather system context.
- User `SERVER002\\admin_test` appears heavily involved in these activities and should be verified for its legitimacy.

### Assessment:
Considering the sequence of actions performed using powerful administrative tools, registry modifications, and system information gathering, the behavior observed strongly suggests:
- **Potential Malicious Activity or Compromise**: Indicators point to an attempt to manipulate system security settings and gather information about user accounts and the system environment, possibly for malicious purposes.

### Recommendation:
1. **Immediate User Verification** - Verify the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account, and if unauthorized, remove or disable it immediately.
2. **Audit Recent Changes** - Check for any unauthorized changes in system policies, particularly related to security settings and group policies.
3. **Review System and Security Logs** - Conduct a thorough review of logs for any other unusual patterns or indications of data exfiltration or lateral movement.
4. **Isolate if Necessary** - Consider isolating the affected host if continuing suspicious activity is detected or pending a detailed forensic analysis.
5. **Strengthen Monitoring** - Implement enhanced monitoring of PowerShell activities and the use of sensitive utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, and consider deploying more restrictive execution policies.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs suggest evidence of potentially malicious activities warranting further investigation, monitoring, and immediate action to mitigate possible threats."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - App Registration,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the log entries for any indicators of malicious activity or anomalous behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Execution**: There is a notable execution of PowerShell with a potentially malicious command. The script is attempting to connect to AzureAD using hardcoded credentials, generate a self-signed certificate, and perform actions that could indicate an attempt to hijack an application. The PowerShell command includes actions such as:
   - Importing the AzureAD module.
   - Creating a new PSCredential object using a hardcoded password.
   - Connecting to AzureAD.
   - Generating a self-signed certificate.
   - Attempting to create a new application key credential for AzureAD applications.
   - Using scripting to automate the process, which resembles tactics often used in script-based attacks, especially given the context of ""application hijacking"".

2. **Command-Line Arguments**: The command-line includes phrases like ""Application Hijacking worked,"" which suggests an intention to manipulate or gain unauthorized access to AzureAD applications. This is a significant red flag.

3. **Process Execution**: The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user account with elevated privileges (`admin_test`). While `wevtutil.exe` is used for querying and managing event logs, its usage without apparent administrative context or legitimate troubleshooting tasks might indicate log tampering or reconnaissance activities.

4. **Event Logging and Privilege Escalation**: The Security log entries (Event ID: 4672) indicate that privileges were assigned that include sensitive activities like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which are typically indicative of elevated or administrative rights on the system.

5. **Continual Microsoft Account Access Failures**: Multiple failed attempts to access a MicrosoftAccount service are logged, which might signal unauthorized access attempts or failure in authentication processes.

### Conclusion
The data suggests a coordinated effort to use PowerShell to automate actions that could lead to unauthorized access or control over AzureAD applications. The use of a hard-coded password and application hijacking script points toward an attempted breach of security.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Action**: 
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
  - Revoke any certificates potentially exploited by this incident.
  - Investigate and reset any potentially compromised accounts, especially those with AzureAD access.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the involved credentials and any changes made to AzureAD applications.
  
- **Further Recommendations**:
  - Implement enhanced monitoring for activities related to PowerShell and AzureAD.
  - Review the system and network logs for more connections or attempts related to similar activity.
  - Train users on the risks of using easy-to-guess or hardcoded passwords.
  - Update incident response procedures to address PowerShell misuse and AzureAD-related threats."
Add Federation to Azure AD,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as particularly suspicious, indicating potential malicious activity.

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is executed, followed closely by the execution of `conhost.exe`. This pattern occurs several times within a short period. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility for managing event logs, its frequent execution, especially on a machine like the CEO's, could indicate log tampering or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed that imports modules `AzureAD` and `AADInternals`. The script appears to attempt a series of actions aiming at manipulating Azure Active Directory configurations using what looks like admin credentials (`bruce.wayne@contosocloud.com`). The use of the `AADInternals` module, combined with the attempt to create a backdoor (`ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor`), is a clear tactic for illegal access or abuse of administrative privileges.
   - The script includes attempts to add federation configurations, further indicating efforts to compromise and establish persistence in the cloud environment.

3. **There is a secure string conversion and attempted authentication using potentially dummy or compromised credentials (`iamthebatman`).**

4. **Indicators of Credential Dumping:**
   - The PowerShell script's operations align closely with attempts to elevate privileges and leverage cloud-based service accounts for unauthorized purposes.

These findings strongly suggest a targeted attack, likely within the context of privilege escalation or persistent backdoor establishment, compromising the domain's security. Such activity is typical of advanced persistent threats (APTs) or other sophisticated cyber crimes.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the nature of the activities observed, they are consistent with tactics seen in malicious use cases. The execution of the suspicious PowerShell command with administrative privileges and the repeated suspicious use of native Windows utilities highlight an intent to manipulate system logs and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** The compromised machine (Server002) should be isolated from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Credential Management:** Reset and review credentials, especially those used in administrative roles. Verify if any unauthorized accounts have been created or if existing ones have been tampered with.

3. **Log Analysis and Retention:** Secure existing logs in off-site storage to analyze further for additional insights and preserve them for forensic examination.

4. **Cloud Platform Security:** Assess and strengthen Azure AD configurations, especially focusing on instances where the backdoors might affect authentication and authorization processes.

5. **Incident Response and Remediation:** Conduct a full incident response procedure, involving thorough scanning for any additional malicious files, scripts, or system changes that have been made by the adversary.

6. **Review and Update Security Policies:** Evaluate current security measures for weaknesses and update them accordingly to prevent similar issues in the future.

7. **Employee Awareness:** Train staff regarding the risks of phishing attacks and the importance of recognizing suspicious activities, as social engineering often plays a role in credential theft.

By taking these steps, the organization can address the current compromise and bolster defenses against future threats."
Shellcode execution via VBA,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, we observe several events which may indicate potentially suspicious activities on the host machine ""Server002"". Below is a detailed assessment:

1. **Unusual Process Execution**:
    - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen, interspersed with calls to `powershell.exe`. Wevtutil is a legitimate utility for managing Windows event logs, but its frequent use in conjunction with PowerShell processes can be indicative of attempts to tamper with event logs.
    - The execution of `powershell.exe` shows a script invocation directly from a URL (`""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1""`). This script appears to be downloaded and executed directly on the machine, which is a typical behavior of a PowerShell-based attack and is considered highly suspicious.

2. **Command-Line Arguments**:
    - The command line arguments for `powershell.exe` involve downloading a script from a GitHub URL and executing it with specific parameters. This might indicate an attempt to bypass typical security mechanisms by executing a remote script. The use of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) and `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) commands supports this suspicion.
    - Arguments passed also interact with temp location files which can be indicative of malicious macro or script execution.

3. **Parent-Child Process Relationship**:
    - The parent process for several PowerShell executions is `wsmprovhost.exe`, known as Windows Remote Management, which could suggest remote commands being issued to the system.
    
4. **Indications of Malicious Intent**:
    - The combination of these processes and command-line arguments, particularly the external script execution via PowerShell, strongly indicates potential malicious activity.
    - Additionally, the repeated initiating some common Windows enumeration and system information gathering commands such as `whoami.exe` aligns with reconnaissance activity often seen in early stages of compromise.

**Threat and Risk Assessment**:
- The identified activities pose a significant risk indicating that the system might be compromised. An attacker could be leveraging a PowerShell command to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: There are clear signs of malicious activity primarily due to the execution of remote scripts via PowerShell and unusual wevtutil operations, which are hallmark indicators of a compromise.
 
**Recommendations**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected system (""Server002"") from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the machine to identify any potential remaining payloads or traces of attacker activity.
3. Review and analyze network logs and communications for any outbound traffic to confirm data exfiltration attempts.
4. Update and strengthen PowerShell logging and monitoring to catch such behaviors in the future.
5. Conduct a security review and patch management check to ensure all systems are updated against known vulnerabilities exploited for such activities."
Process Injection via C#,"## Analysis of Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Powershell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell process (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) was executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This execution by itself is not inherently malicious but requires further scrutiny considering the context of the CEO machine being flagged.
   
2. **Command-line Execution:**
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing another executable `data.exe` located in a temporary folder (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\bin\\data.exe`) appears suspicious. Running executables from temporary folders is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection.
   - This `data.exe` is possibly a payload or a tool executed manually or programmatically, especially since the hash `SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0` does not correlate with known benign hashes in common filesystem paths.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were observed. This utility is often used to query or clear event logs, which can signify a potential attempt to cover tracks if used maliciously.
   
4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are logs indicating time manipulation (`EventID: 4616`) in the System and Security logs through `svchost.exe`, which cannot be straightforwardly explained as benign. Tampering with system time can be used to manipulate the timeline of actions or to evade time-based security measures.

**Malicious Activity Indicators:**

- The presence of unauthorized or suspicious execution in short bursts, especially involving PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, points towards potentially malicious activity aimed at either gathering information, executing payloads, or interfering with log records.
- The `data.exe` executed from a temporary directory is marked suspicious because it is not accompanied by any legitimate system activity or similarity to common system operations, often indicating malware or unauthorized software.
- Time changes without a legitimate contextual explanation, possibly combined with log modifications through `wevtutil.exe`, could signify an attempt to obfuscate actions on the system, suggesting tampering for nefarious purposes.

## Assessment and Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The cumulative evidence of suspicious processes, especially the execution of `data.exe` from a temporary path by `cmd.exe`, which is executed by a high-integrity level user, PowerShell execution, and potential log tampering through `wevtutil.exe` align with signs of a malicious intrusion effort.
- Immediate steps should involve isolating the affected machine from the corporate network to prevent potential lateral movement. Conduct further investigation on the `data.exe` executable by running it through malware analysis tools and correlating the hash with any known threat actor indicators.
- Review and cross-verify system and application logs to identify any data exfiltration or further unauthorized accounts or actions.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis followed by a system restore to a secure state after securing any evidence required for post-mortem analysis."
Azure AD - adding permission to application,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and findings:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) with high integrity levels. This suggests that an administrative user or process initiated the PowerShell sessions.
   - The command line for the PowerShell execution appears to be performing activities related to Azure AD, including connecting to Azure AD services, creating applications and service principals, and assigning roles. It uses `ConvertTo-SecureString` to handle credentials directly in the script, raising potential security concerns, such as credential exposure if logs are mismanaged.
   - Specific actions like `Connect-AzureAD`, `New-AzureADApplication`, and `Set-AzureADApplication` suggest attempts to interface with Azure AD for application and role management.
   - The script seems advanced and targeted towards Azure AD setup, which could be legitimate if managed infrastructure personnel conduct it.

2. **Process Anomalies:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen alongside PowerShell executions. While `wevtutil.exe` is used to interact with Windows Event Logs, its sudden multiple invocations could hint at log tampering attempts or legitimate administrative tasks.
   - The appearance of `conhost.exe` alongside PowerShell and log utility executions might be expected, but the frequency and sequence can suggest command-line activity that could be investigated further.

3. **System-Level Processes:**
   - Processes like `wbem\WMIADAP.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdge*.exe` are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These appear tied to system maintenance and Edge browser updates, but their timing should be corroborated with known update schedules to ensure legitimacy.

4. **User Context:**
   - Activities predominantly occur under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, reflecting administrative action. However, this context is also a common target for compromises and deserves scrutiny.
   - Important to correlate if the actions correspond with any authorized maintenance windows or scheduled tasks to rule out potential misuse or compromise.

**Assessment:**
The behavior noted in the PowerShell execution is quite advanced and appears to target administrative configurations within Azure environments, possibly indicating automated infrastructure setup or configuration changes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- While some activities may align with legitimate administrative operations, the nature of the PowerShell script related to Azure AD management, combined with the unexpected frequency of other processes, warrants further investigation. There's no direct evidence of a breach, but these actions should be verified with the admin team to validate their intent and origin.

**Guidance on Proceeds:**
1. **Verification:**
   - Confirm with IT whether the Azure AD and PowerShell activities align with planned administrative tasks.
   - Check if `SERVER002\admin_test` role assignments and permissions are appropriate and expected.

2. **Audit Logs:**
   - Review Azure AD audit logs to supplement and check for any unexpected changes or permissions.

3. **Credential Security:**
   - Ensure credential management practices are robust to avoid exposure through script usage.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring around privileged actions like PowerShell script executions and Azure AD modifications to promptly detect unauthorized changes."
Process Injection with Go using EtwpCreateEtwThread WinAPI,"Based on the provided event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

**PowerShell Log**:
- The logs show a sequence of PowerShell executions involving the `powershell.exe` application starting an executable from a temporary file location: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\bin\x64\EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe`. This action is repeated across multiple logs and seems to be running with a `-debug` parameter.
- The use of executables located within the Temp directory is generally a red flag, as it's a common technique used by malware to evade detection by writing executable files to temporary paths and executing them from there.

**Sysmon Log**:
- The Sysmon logs indicate several process creations, particularly involving PowerShell and other Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. The PowerShell execution matches that observed in the PowerShell logs.
- The `whoami.exe` and other system processes have been executed by the `admin_test` account, which suggests someone was trying to gather system information or change settings.
- Sysmon logs show the execution of processes typically used for administrative tasks, but the context (`admin_test` using PowerShell to run a potentially unknown executable) is suspicious.

**Security Log**:
- The security logs show multiple logon events associated with the user `admin_test`.
- Administrative privileges are indicated by the privileges list, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This suggests an account with elevated privileges and potentially aggressive actions on the host.
- Activity under the `NtLmSsp` logon process suggests network-related authentication. The NtLmSsp activity could indicate access from a remote host.

**Analysis and Recommendations**:

The behavior captured in these logs is highly indicative of malicious activity:
1. Execution of an unattributed executable from a temporary directory by PowerShell, particularly with debugging parameters, is suggestive of an exploit or payload delivery mechanism.
2. Gathering of system information using tools like `whoami` by an administrator account (`admin_test`) could indicate post-exploitation activity by an attacker.
3. The presence of elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others) used by the account matches common privilege escalation scenarios.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Thoroughly inspect the path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\` for malicious binaries or scripts and move them for forensic analysis.
- Review user activities of `admin_test` and other privileged accounts for unauthorized access or changes.
- Reset credentials for potentially compromised accounts.
- Conduct a deeper investigation into any recent software installations or changes in the environment.
- Consider deploying additional threat detection mechanisms like more robust EDR solutions or anomaly detection systems to prevent similar incidents.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definite signs of malicious activity, involving potential compromise of an account or system."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Uppercase Character in Password,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations indicate patterns suggestive of potential malicious activity:


### Analysis of the Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Log

1. **Consistent PowerShell Execution Attempts**:
   - Several instances of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) are attempting to read a credential file located at `""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\file\\$env:USERNAME.txt""`.
   - The script logic involves checking if the credential file exists, comparing a stored password against a hard coded password (`lower-long-special-333`), and attempts to reset an Active Directory account password.
   - If the stored password is incorrect, the script deletes the credential file and requests re-execution of preliminary commands.
   - The script outputs success messages upon changing passwords and re-saving credentials in the file.
   - This behavior suggests attempts to manipulate user credentials, possibly without the user’s knowledge or consent.

#### Security Log

2. **Multiple Group Enumeration Events**:
   - Event ID 4798 logs are showing several calls made by `CompatTelRunner.exe` to enumerate groups on the system, including administrative and user accounts (e.g., `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `Guest`).
   - The use of `CompatTelRunner.exe`, primarily associated with telemetry tasks, for enumerating user groups stands out as unusual and potentially indicative of reconnaissance.

3. **Privileged Operations**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to `SYSTEM`, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, which are high-level privileges usually exploited in privilege escalation scenarios.

#### Sysmon Log

4. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - Multiple executions and parent process relationships involve `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used for event log management, being executed multiple times suggests potential tampering with event logs.

5. **Execution of Reconnaissance Tools**:
   - Appearance of `whoami.exe` and hostname-related operations which could signal attempts to gather environment or context data.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

Given the PowerShell operations and the enumeration of users/groups processes by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, the activity seems unauthorized and aligns with common malicious tactics like credential stuffing and reconnaissance in a network compromise. The combination of these indicators enhances the suspicion that these logs might reflect malicious activities.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Immediate Actions:**
- **Isolate the affected system (Server002):** Prevent further potential damage.
- **Conduct full forensic analysis:** Includes memory, disk, and network activity on the server.
- **Review access controls and permissions**: Ensure no unauthorized changes were made.
- **Reset affected user credentials**: If compromised, ensure they are set securely and uniquely.
- **Audit PowerShell scripts and ensure logging is enabled** for all PowerShell activities to provide traceability.
- **Investigate the origin of the credential file logic:** Assess where it was created and the source of distribution of this script.

**Future Prevention:**
- Implement more stringent logging and alerting for suspect PowerShell and `CompatTelRunner.exe` activities.
- Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious scripts or credential management processes.
- Consider disabling or restricting 'CompatTelRunner.exe' if it is non-essential in your context.

These actions should help mitigate the immediate threat and strengthen security posture."
secedit used to create a Run key in the HKLM Hive,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Service Executions and Time Changes:**
   - The logs reflect normal service operations related to the Microsoft Edge Update. There are frequent service start and stop operations, which aligns with standard behavior for applications managing updates, such as Edge.
   - In the security logs, there are Event ID 4616 entries indicating that the system time was adjusted. These changes were executed by `svchost.exe`, a common process used by legitimate services and malware alike. However, there is no direct indication of it being used maliciously here. 

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show extensive use of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` operations. The `wevtutil.exe` tool is legitimate and used for managing Windows event logs, typically used by administrators.
   - Multiple entries demonstrate command line usage for `cmd.exe` and `secedit.exe`. While using `SecEdit` is an administrative action to configure security policies, in combination with `cmd.exe` and their location (within a temporary directory), it is somewhat unusual and worth further scrutiny to ensure it is not being misused in this context.
   
3. **Process Lineage:**
   - Process events like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running with system integrity suggest a legitimate purpose related to the update mechanism of Microsoft software.
   - The use of temporary directories for executing command lines (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\regtemplate.ini`) is a red flag because such locations are often used by malware to evade detection.

4. **Privileges and Integrity Levels:**
   - Processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` have a high level of access. The extensive operations carried out by such users are typical for system processes but highlight the need for vigilance to ensure these operations are on the up and up.
   
### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activities**: While most activities observed can be aligned with legitimate operations (e.g., Microsoft Edge updates, security configurations via `SecEdit`), the scripts and command executions in temporary directories alongside time changes by `svchost.exe` combined with high integrity levels suggest some suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: While no direct evidence of compromise is observed, the pattern and context (e.g., potential privilege escalation and the use of a temporary directory in executing configuration changes) suggest that there may be an underlying risk warranting further detailed investigation. It is critical to verify the legitimacy of the actions taken with system security and administrative tools to rule out any malicious intent.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a deeper investigation into the use of `secedit.exe` to ensure that the registry template configurations are authorized.
- Verify with IT administrators whether the observed time changes are expected behavior or if they potentially suggest tampering.
- Monitor and cross-reference the changes in system and application settings with legitimate administrative actions and IT logs to ensure no unauthorized configurations are occurring.
- Increase endpoint monitoring to detect any anomalies with the processes mentioned, especially when executed from locations often leveraged by malicious actors."
HKLM - Add malicious StubPath value to existing Active Setup Entry,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Command Expansion via PowerShell:**
   - One of the most suspicious activities found in the logs is the usage of PowerShell to modify the registry. The command being executed is:
     - `powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}"" ""StubPath"" ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" -Force & $env:SYSTEMROOT\system32\runonce.exe /AlternateShellStartup}`
   - This command is used to set a registry key that seemingly replaces a component's execution path with `calc.exe` (the Windows Calculator), potentially for persistence or execution mock purposes.
   - Utilizing `runonce.exe` with `/AlternateShellStartup` is also indicative of a bypass or sophisticated technique to persist or trigger particular startup behavior.

2. **Processes with Uncommon Parameters:**
   - Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line flags could suggest more than just standard update processes, especially if the behavior is atypical or inappropriate in the context (e.g., `/regserver`).
   - The PowerShell command setting a registry key for the calculator and executing it via a shell indicates possible tampering.

3. **Wevtutil Use:**
   - There are multiple entries where `wevtutil.exe` is executed by the user `admin_test`. `wevtutil` is typically used for managing event logs, and its usage in malicious scenarios might relate to covering tracks or conducting reconnaissance.

4. **User Context for System Commands:**
   - System commands executed under user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity suggest that commands running within administrative context, which can pose a higher risk if exploited.

#### Conclusion:

- The use of PowerShell to alter registry keys for potential persistence or hijacking through calc.exe, combined with the high frequency and variety of system utilities being utilized (conhost, wevtutil, etc.), indicate behaviors that are suspicious and indicative of scripting or semi-automated processes often associated with malicious activity.
- The behavior of Edge update processes executing with parameters out of the ordinary or atypical for a purely benign update scenario exacerbates the suspicion, though on their own, without context, they align with typical software maintenance processes.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior seen in the logs, particularly concerning the PowerShell script and registry manipulation, combined with consistent invocation of system utilities in a user-admin context, merit further investigation to determine the full scope and intent of the activity observed.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the modifications made to the registry and assess the authenticity and purpose of executing calc.exe in such a manner.
   - Review `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` logs in greater detail to validate their authenticity and purpose.

2. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Review user `admin_test` actions and sessions during this period for context and intent, particularly focusing on logs associated with `wevtutil` and similar utilities.
   - Check if there are any known vulnerabilities or exploits within the software or versions mentioned.

3. **Review System Configuration:**
   - Double-check startup entries and persistence mechanisms to ensure no unauthorized modifications have been made.
   - Conduct a full security audit and assessment of the host machine.

4. **Escalation:**
   - If suspicious activity persists or additional malicious indicators are found, escalate to incident response for isolation, containment, and detailed forensic analysis."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

### Suspicious Activities Noted:

1. **Time Change Logs (Security Log) - EventID 4616:**
   - There were events recorded where the system time was adjusted backward. The Windows Security EventID 4616 indicates that the system time was changed, which typically should be a rare event and might be linked to attempts to evade detection or logging of malicious activities.
   - The process making the change is `C:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe`, executed under `LOCAL SERVICE` account. While this can be legitimate, the context of other events should be considered.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `admin_test` are noted. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows Event Logs, it can also be used maliciously to clear logs or perform other suspicious activity.
   - The execution of PowerShell in combination with `CreateThreadNative.exe` under the `admin_test` user is particularly alarming. This indicates potential script-based attacks often used for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or to execute malicious payloads.
   - `CreateThreadNative.exe` itself is suspicious given it is executed from a user's Temp directory, often a location for orchestrating attacks.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Several PowerShell events (EventID 600) show the execution of `powershell.exe` with the command to run `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\x64\\CreateThreadNative.exe -debug`, which is a non-standard operation for a regular user.
   - The execution of CreateThreadNative.exe potentially points toward a sophisticated piece of malware that can manipulate the execution flow of processes.

### Observations in Context:

- The execution of PowerShell scripts and tools such as `wevtutil.exe` are red flags considering typical behaviors associated with attempts to move laterally across systems or escalate privileges.
- The presence of commands executing from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`) further supports indications of malicious activity, where executables are often staged.

### Assessment:

The log data presents a strong indication of suspicious activity leaning towards malicious intent due to:
- Unscheduled time changes potentially indicative of log tampering.
- Unusual executions of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell running potentially harmful executables from atypical directories.
- These coupled events suggest an attempt to obscure actions, maintain persistence, or execute unauthorized changes on the system.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs clearly indicate malicious behaviors and should be treated as a compromise.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Incident Response Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough root-cause analysis and disk analysis to identify any other compromised components.
   - Review user `admin_test` activities and credentials for unauthorized access or privilege escalations.

2. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Remove malware or unauthorized tools found on the system.
   - Apply any pending security patches and updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities that could have facilitated this activity.

3. **Strengthen Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Enhance monitoring policies around critical user and system operations, especially involving administrative accounts and sensitive directories such as the Temp folder.
   - Ensure logging configurations are resilient to unauthorized changes, and implement alerts for anomalies related to time changes or execution of critical utilities like PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`.

This assessment should lead to a detailed security assessment aided by threat intelligence to prevent further incidents and improve overall organizational security posture."
Add Executable Shortcut Link to User Startup Folder,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs from various channels (Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and System), several observations can be made regarding potential suspicious or malicious activity.

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell was used to create a shortcut to `calc.exe` in the startup folder. This is highly suspicious because adding a shortcut to an executable in the startup directory ensures persistence, which is a common technique used by malware to maintain execution after a reboot.
   - The PowerShell command used: 
     ```powershell
     $Target = ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe""
     $ShortcutLocation = ""$home\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\calc_exe.lnk""
     $WScriptShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
     $Create = $WScriptShell.CreateShortcut($ShortcutLocation)
     $Create.TargetPath = $Target
     $Create.Save()
     ```
   - This is indicative of an attempt to persistently execute `calc.exe`, and it's unusual for legitimate software to require `calc.exe` on startup, especially using such an involved method.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs detail the execution of numerous processes, most notably `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While not inherently malicious on their own, the context or frequency might be relevant. These utilities can be used to gather information about user or system configurations, which can be a precursor to significant malicious actions.
   - Continuous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its various components were noted. While this could be a normal update behavior, the timing and pattern could further correlate with unwanted persistence or malware masquerading as a legitimate process. 

3. **Updates and Defender:**
   - Regular activity connected to Microsoft Defender updates and Windows Update is visible in the logs. These operations themselves appear benign, maintaining security intelligence.

### Conclusion:

The creation of a startup shortcut for `calc.exe` via PowerShell indicates a strong potential for malicious intent, aiming for persistence. While PowerShell can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, its use for persistence along with obscure command-line operations requires further investigation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate the source of the PowerShell command. Identify the user or process that initiated this script and whether it was authorized.
   - Remove the suspicious shortcut from the startup directory.

2. **System Security:**
   - Perform a full antivirus and malware scan on the machine to detect and remove any malware.
   - Monitor for similar behaviors in other endpoints as this could suggest a wider infection or attack vector.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review any related firewall and network logs during the time of events for unusual outbound connections.
   - Check whether these behaviors have cascaded effects on other systems within the same network environment.
  
By addressing these points, you ensure the security and integrity of the affected system and mitigate potential risks stemming from this activity."
Winlogon HKLM Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"**Analysis of Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several entries stand out as concerning and suggest possible malicious activities:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**:
   - Multiple PowerShell commands were executed with command lines that modify registry keys related to user initialization (`Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" -Force`). Modifying the `Userinit` registry key is a known technique to maintain persistence by executing additional programs during user logon.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - The execution of PowerShell in this manner and the subsequent registry changes imply an intention to manipulate the startup process, which is often used by attackers to ensure their code executes with elevated privileges when the user logs in.

3. **Security Privileges Identification**:
   - The log entry for event ID 4672 indicates that the user `SERVER002\admin_test` was granted a wide range of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. These privileges can potentially allow processes to take control over other sensitive processes and escalate privileges, a hallmark of malicious intent if not typically granted.

4. **Suspicious Time Changes**:
   - The logs show repeated time changes, where the system's time was altered. While not inherently malicious, frequent unauthorized changes to system time are unusual and can indicate attempts to obfuscate activities by altering logs.

5. **Additional Observations**:
   - The frequent invocation of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests some reconnaissance activity, as these commands are typically used to gather information about the system and user.
   - The edge update process logs indicate regular updates for Microsoft Edge, which seem benign, but are noteworthy as they coincide with suspicious scripts.

**Assessment:**

The combination of modifying the `Userinit` registry key using PowerShell, coupled with the assignment of key privileges, suggests an attempt at maintaining persistence and potentially privilege escalation. The behavior observed is indicative of post-exploitation activities commonly associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs).

**Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence strongly points to a deliberate attempt to manipulate system behavior for persistence, likely indicative of a compromise. Immediate actions to contain and remediate the suspected breach are necessary.

**Guidance:**

1. **Containment**: 
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the machine to determine the scope of the attack and identify root cause, particularly any linked malware or unauthorized user accounts.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Investigate and clean any unauthorized registry changes, particularly those involving startup and logon modifications.
   - Review and revoke any excessive privileges granted and ensure only legitimate users have administrative access.
   
4. **Prevention**:
   - Strengthen monitoring of registry changes and PowerShell activities across the network.
   - Implement stricter least-privilege policies and regularly review privilege assignments to prevent privilege misuse.

By following these actions, the system can be cleaned and secured to prevent future incidents."
Process Injection via Extra Window Memory (EWM) x64 executable,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**1. Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:**

- **System Level and Logon Events:**
  - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned during logon (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege). This is commonly seen during normal activity for processes running under the SYSTEM account, but combined with suspicious process activity, may be indicative of privilege misuse.
  - Event ID 4624 and 4672 appearing close together suggest a service start or logon with administrative privileges.

- **Process Execution and Command-line Activity:**
  - Sysmon Event Logs (Event IDs 1 and 5): There are several instances of PowerShell being executed (`powershell.exe`) with unusual command-line arguments. Of particular note is:
    - `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\bin\\data.011_x64.exe}`: This indicates PowerShell is executing a binary file from a temporary directory which is not typical for legitimate process executions.
    - The binary `data.011_x64.exe` from a temporary path raises significant suspicion as potential malware or an illicit execution.

- **Other Noteworthy Process Executions:**
  - Regular processes like `svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `sc.exe` are observed, which are customary services in Windows OS. However, their timing in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell activity should be scrutinized.
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions also noted but seem less suspicious compared to PowerShell activity.

- **Credential and Account Operations:**
  - Event ID 5379 in the logs points to attempts at accessing credential material which was not successful (`ReturnCode"":""3221226021""`), indicating possibly unauthorized attempts in accessing credentials, an anomaly worth investigating further.
  
- **PowerShell Logs:**
  - Consistent with Sysmon logs, PowerShell logs highlight the execution of `data.011_x64.exe` via PowerShell, flagged as anomalous behavior, usually associated with scripting attacks or malware exploitation.

**2. Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:**

Based on the PowerShell and Sysmon logs:
- The execution of `data.011_x64.exe` from a temporary directory using PowerShell is highly indicative of a malicious activity. The name of the binary and its execution from an unconventionally used directory for trusted programs suggests a potential compromise or persistence mechanism often seen with malware.
- The usage of administrative privileges and attempts to query credentials by SYSTEM account adds to the overall suspicion.

**Recommendation and Resolution:**

- **Malicious Indicator**: Given the execution of suspicious PowerShell commands and binaries, there is a strong indication of malicious activity. It’s crucial to investigate the origin and purpose of `data.011_x64.exe`.
  
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - Immediate steps should include isolating the CEO’s machine from the network for a thorough forensic analysis.
  - Analyze and determine other potentially affected systems, and assess how the suspicious binary came to be executed.
  - Review recent changes in security and application policies to identify and mitigate the entry vector.
  - Consider a wider investigation into network and endpoint activity to ensure containment and eradication of the threat."
Print Processors,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious Behaviors and Anomalies:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Command**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with a sequence of commands that manipulate the print spooler service, copy a DLL file, and modify the Windows Registry key. This activity is seen in the logs dated ""2024-10-27 17:10:22.8711375"".
   - Specifically, the script attempts to:
     - Change the spooler service startup type to automatic.
     - Stop the spooler service.
     - Copy `fileTest.dll` to `C:\Windows\System32\spool\prtprocs\x64\`.
     - Modify a registry key to add a Print Processor with the new DLL.
     - Restart the spooler service.

2. **Registry and Service Manipulation**:
   - The modification of the registry and the copying of DLL files to sensitive system directories is typically associated with attempts to persist malware or backdoor access.
   - The PowerShell command uses obfuscation techniques to embed a DLL and alter registry settings, suggesting malicious intent.

3. **Execution of System Tools**:
   - Commands like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed under the admin_test user context. While these utilities may be used normally, their execution can also imply lateral movement or reconnaissance activity by an attacker.

4. **Privileges and High Integrity Levels**:
   - The execution shows a ""High"" integrity level, indicating privileged process execution, which is consistent with scenarios involving privilege escalation or execution under elevated permissions.

5. **Frequent Process Creation**:

Process Injection via mavinject.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key points and potential threats emerge:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell was executed with a command that includes starting a Notepad process, injecting a DLL (`data.001.dll`) into it using `mavinject`, and then terminating the Notepad process. This behavior is indicative of process injection, a technique often used by malware to run its code within the address space of another process, effectively bypassing security and detection mechanisms.

2. **Use of `mavinject`**:
   - `mavinject`, a legitimate tool available on Windows, is being utilized to inject a DLL into a running process (Notepad), which is highly suspicious. This tool, when abused, is commonly associated with malware activity or post-exploitation tasks by attackers.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` is seen, but the most notable is its use to export event logs (`epl`) to a temporary directory. Such an activity could be part of an attempt to cover tracks or exfiltrate logs.

4. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - A series of processes, including `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, were run in quick succession. While these processes can be legitimate, running them together, especially after a sequence involving potential malicious activity, can indicate reconnaissance or gathering system information by a threat actor.

5. **Miscellaneous Legitimate Background Processes**:
   - Several processes related to system maintenance and updates (such as Windows Update components and Microsoft Edge Installer) were observed but likely represent standard background operations during a system update.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs, there are multiple indicators suggesting potential malicious activity, primarily due to the use of PowerShell for process injection into Notepad using `mavinject`. This behavior aligns with known techniques used by attackers to gain an unauthorized execution path and often correlates with malicious intent.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The analysis concludes that these log entries contain definitive signs of malicious activity. Immediate steps should include:

- **Review Security Policies**: Assess current security measures and enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
- **Incident Response**: Follow your organization's incident response procedures to mitigate and remediate the impact of this activity.

This activity is highly indicative of a compromise, and handling it promptly and effectively is crucial to prevent potential lateral movement and data exfiltration."
Azure AD - Add Company Administrator Role to a user,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - **Command Details**: Multiple PowerShell commands were executed on `Server002` involving credential creation using `ConvertTo-SecureString` and `New-Object` to create `PSCredentials`. Following this, the `Connect-MsolService` is used to connect with credentials and a role modification (`Add-MsolRoleMember`) to add a user to the ""Company Administrator"" role.
   - **Potential Threat**: The use of PowerShell with `ConvertTo-SecureString`, creating `PSCredential` objects, and modifying admin roles is indicative of potentially malicious behavior, such as privilege escalation or unauthorized access. This is particularly concerning given it seems to involve modifying active directory roles, which is sensitive.
   - **User Context**: The activity was executed under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Use of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
   - **Details**: There are numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the presence of these processes alone is not inherently malicious, their frequency and context could indicate attempts to manipulate or extract event logs, which is a behavior sometimes seen in post-exploitation phases.

3. **Hash Based Identification**:
   - Multiple process executions have the same SHA256 hash values which could be benign but should be cross-referenced against known hash values to confirm authenticity.
   
4. **Use of Svchost and Taskhostw**:
   - These processes are standard Windows processes. However, any usage patterns should be monitored to ensure they are within expected operational parameters, although, in this instance, everything seems executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal for these service hosts.

### Threat Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The PowerShell script execution's nature, specifically dealing with administrative role modifications, raises significant suspicion and necessitates further investigation. The potential for privilege escalation or unauthorized access is a serious concern. Coupled with the high volume of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions, an in-depth investigation is warranted.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate User Verification**: Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user and whether such actions comply with their role. Review recent changes and permissions for this account.
   
2. **Review Active Directory and MsolService Logs**: Identify any unauthorized modifications to roles, particularly the ""Company Administrator"" roles, and confirm any such activities align with legitimate administrative tasks.

3. **Hash Verification**: Compare the hash values of the executed files against known good or suspicious hash databases to verify file integrity.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up enhanced monitoring for subsequent PowerShell script executions and related suspicious activities.

5. **Incident Response Plan**: Depending on findings, consider enacting your incident response plan to contain potential threats and mitigate any unauthorized actions.

Based on the identified activities, further investigation is prudent. The logs contain signals that could indicate a potential security issue that merits deeper examination to confirm whether a breach or malicious activity has occurred."
Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile,"Based on an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed with a command that moves a local configuration file (`settings.json`) from the Windows Terminal directory to a temporary directory and then downloads a remote file from GitHub using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This remote file is redownloaded and set to replace the original configuration file. The command suggests potential unauthorized modification of the system's configuration files.
   - This type of behavior is commonly associated with initial stages of an attack where a threat actor attempts to alter configuration files to execute further malicious actions or maintain persistence.

2. **Execution of Admin-Level Commands:**
   - The logs show the execution of several processes, including `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, under the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels, which indicates administrative privileges.
   - Specific focus should be on multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, an event log management utility. Such execution may indicate an attempt to dump or tamper with Windows event logs to cover tracks. This command is executed multiple times, which could be consistent with either legitimate administrative activity or log tampering by an attacker.

3. **Unusual Pattern of Process Creation:**
   - The close temporal proximity and rapid succession of process creations revolving around PowerShell, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` raise red flags, especially with no additional community logs (e.g., Application, Security, System) to corroborate typical administrative actions or any scheduled administrative operations that might use similar sequences.

4. **Lack of Contextual Information:**
   - Although the logs suggest suspicious activities, additional information such as scheduled tasks, background schemes, or circumstantial evidences like scheduled backups or updates which could explain these events is missing.

5. **Impact and Recommendations:**
   - The key concern is potential unwanted changes to system settings and the integrity of the Windows event logs.
   - Isolating the server temporarily and conducting a thorough inspection of the trustworthiness of modified files, system configurations, any unexplained network traffic directed towards GitHub or other external locations, and access review of the `admin_test` user account is recommended.
   - Conduct a root cause analysis to determine whether the changes made were legitimate and authorized and monitor for any further unauthorized changes or access attempts.
   - Review access control policies for running administrative scripts and ensure robust logging and tracking of all administrative activities on sensitive systems such as the CEO's machine.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**  
The logs suggest activity that deviates from normal behavior and implies the potential for unauthorized configuration changes or security-compromising actions, possibly linked to an attempted compromise. Further investigation is warranted to confirm or rule out malicious intent."
Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several findings suggest potential indicators of suspicious activity, with both benign and potentially malicious elements present.

1. **Time Change Events (Security Log & System Log):**
    - There are multiple entries (EventID 4616 in Security Log and EventID 1 in System Log) indicating time adjustments on `Server002` via the `svchost.exe` process. While time changes can occur due to legitimate reasons such as time synchronization with an NTP server, they are worth close attention if correlated with other suspicious activities due to attackers tampering with system time.

2. **Use of `whoami` and `wevtutil` Executables (Sysmon Log):**
    - The execution of built-in utilities `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by user `SERVER002\\admin_test` can indicate enumeration activity. The constant usage of these commands in a short span is unusual for typical user operations and might suggest that someone is attempting to gather information about the environment.

3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe` (Sysmon Log):**
    - A highly suspicious entry is found where `cmd.exe`, initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, executes a command to add a new registry entry referencing a DLL file (`PortMonitor.dll`) in a temporary location. The use of a registry to load a DLL is a technique often used for persistence by malware. The integrity level of the executed process is high, indicating potential privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Edge Update Operations (Sysmon Log & Application Log):**
    - Multiple operations involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated executables occur, which appear to be regular update processes. However, the intensity and frequency of events related to these updates, especially processes spawning from temporary directories, should be verified against normal expected behaviors and scheduled update times to exclude the possibility of masquerading malware activities.

5. **No Clear PowerShell Logs:**
    - The absence of meaningful PowerShell logs is interesting. If PowerShell activity was involved in any suspicious cases, logs might have been cleared purposefully.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- The registry modification using `cmd.exe` to add a potentially malicious DLL is particularly concerning and is a strongly indicative of compromise.
- The multiple uses of enumeration tools such as `whoami` and potential manipulation using `wevtutil` contribute to the suspicion, alongside the benign look of some legitimate updates like Microsoft Edge.

Given the evidence suggesting attempts at persistence (registry modification with foreign DLLs) and information gathering:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise and retrieve potential artifacts.
   - Verify the integrity of the registry entries and assess suspicious DLL files for malware.
   
2. **Threat Hunting & Monitoring:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of related systems, looking for similar registry entries and behavior.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on key systems, focusing on anomalous process executions and file changes.

- Account enumeration through atypical means (`CompatTelRunner.exe`).
- High privilege process execution hinting at potential misuse of access rights.

These activities suggest a need for a deeper investigation into the context and legitimacy of these operations.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities noted, while not definitively malicious, present strong indicators that warrant further investigation. It is advised to investigate the legitimacy of the PowerShell script usage, the timestamp and context of the suspected manual/scripted User Account reconnaissance, and verify the associated activities with respective users and administrators."
TinyTurla backdoor service w64time,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple indicators that warrant attention:

1. **Time Change Events**: In the security log EventID 4616 and system log EventID 1, there are multiple time change events where the system time was altered slightly. While time synchronization occurs regularly, alterations to the system time can sometimes be indicative of malicious activity, especially when associated with other suspicious activities.

2. **Service Creation and Configuration**: In the Sysmon logs, there's clear evidence of service creation with the `cmd.exe` process executing various commands to copy a DLL and create, configure, and start a service named “W64Time”:
   - Creating the service with `sc create W64Time binPath= ""c:\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe -k TimeService"" type= share start=auto`
   - Adding registry entries for the service and setting its parameters.
   
   This is highly suspicious because the legitimate Windows Time Service is usually configured differently and does not require custom DLLs to be copied. The use of `cmd.exe` with such command lines indicates potential persistence mechanisms typical in malware activities.

3. **High Privilege Operations**: Both in the Security log (EventID 4672) and Sysmon events, there is evidence of privilege elevation or usage of high-privilege tokens by the user `admin_test`, which includes privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege`. These privileges are often leveraged for lateral movement or escalating privileges unjustly within a compromised environment.

4. **Unexpected Processes Execution**: The Sysmon log shows frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `admin_test`. Although they can be executed legitimately, their frequent and clustered execution, following a suspicious service creation, adds to the suspicious activity profile.

5. **Command Line Activity**: The command line activity involving system modification tools like `reg.exe` and new DLLs is suggestive of an attempt to establish or maintain persistence. The legitimate system tools (`sc.exe`, `reg.exe`) used in this manner can often indicate a ""living-off-the-land"" technique by attackers.

Given these findings, the activities documented in these logs are indicative of potential malicious activity aiming to persist and escalate privileges within the system. 

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Containment**: If possible, isolate the system `Server002` from the network to prevent further malicious activities or propagation within the network.
- **Detailed Memory Analysis**: Perform a memory dump and analyze for any in-memory malware or shellcode that could have facilitated these operations.

Create shortcut to cmd in startup folders,"### Detailed Analysis:

### Key Indicators:
1. **Powershell Activity**:
   - Several Powershell sessions initiated, executing scripts that create shortcuts pointing to `cmd.exe` in startup directories. 
   - Specifically, the Powershell command creating shortcuts in the startup folder and pointing them to `cmd.exe` is highly suspicious. It sets the stage for persistence, which could allow further malicious payloads to execute upon system startup.

2. **Suspicious Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - The execution of utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` is commonly seen in post-exploitation scenarios where an attacker is trying to gather information about the compromised system and the current user context.
   - Although these utilities can be used legitimately by administrators, their presence post the suspicious Powershell activity raises red flags.

3. **Wevtutil and SearchProtocolHost Activity**:
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` could imply that an attempt was made to tamper with Event Logs, often a step taken in covering tracks post-compromise.
   - The execution of `SearchProtocolHost.exe` and `SearchFilterHost.exe` appears legitimate, initiated by the `SearchIndexer.exe`.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - While the Edge update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is running as expected, its execution alongside other unusual activities amplifies the suspicion but doesn't directly indicate malicious actions. 

### Indicators of Compromise:
- **Command Line Shortcuts**: Creating shortcuts that launch `cmd.exe` clearly suggests the intent to establish persistence via a malicious script or service.
- **Post-Exploitation Behavior**: Enumertion through `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` fits the pattern of a post-compromise exercise to gather data.
- **Powershell Command Use**: This specific command line activity is often seen in automated attacks aimed to change startup configurations stealthily.

### Conclusion:
The logs present several actions that are considered suspicious and out of the ordinary for typical user behavior, particularly the powershell script creating startup entries targeting `cmd.exe` indicates a potential security issue. The sequence of events and the nature of commands executed align with actions taken by an attacker attempting to establish persistence and gather information on the system environment.

Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several noteworthy observations indicating potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Commands:**
   - The PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs reveal the execution of a suspicious PowerShell script. The script modifies registry entries related to the LSA (Local Security Authority) security packages, which is atypical for regular administrative tasks. The script uses unusual arguments such as adding `AtomicTest.dll` to the `Security Packages`, which is highly suspicious and a potential indicator of a post-exploitation attack or persistence method.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs show that the logs were cleared by the `admin_test` user, which is often an attempt by an attacker to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized activities. Clearing logs, especially from key security events, is a red flag for malicious activities.

3. **Use of wevtutil to Clear Logs:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument `cl` on several event channels, including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", etc., further supports the suspicion of activity intended to hide malicious behavior.

4. **Unexpected Process Creations with `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen executed by `admin_test` with high integrity level permissions. Although `whoami.exe` is a legitimate command-line utility used to display user information, its frequent execution in a high-integrity context alongside other suspicious activities might indicate attempts to probe user permissions, potentially to perform privilege escalation or lateral movement.

Given these findings, it is critical to treat this scenario as potentially compromised:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

HKLM - Append Command to Winlogon Userinit KEY Value,"Based on the provided event logs, here is a comprehensive analysis of potential indicators of compromise or malicious activity:

### Suspicious Findings:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs reveal modification of the registry value at `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit`. The command changes `Userinit` to include a launch of `calc.exe`. This is highly unusual and typically signifies an attempt at persistence by executing additional binaries when a user logs in.
   
   Example command:
   ```powershell
   $oldvalue = $(Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" -Name ""Userinit"");
   Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" -Name ""Userinit-backup"" -Value ""$oldvalue"";
   $newvalue = $oldvalue + "" C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"";
   Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"" -Name ""Userinit"" -Value ""$newvalue"";
   ```

   **Reasoning**: Modifying the `Userinit` key in the registry is a classic technique to achieve persistence on a Windows machine. The inclusion of `calc.exe` might seem benign, but it serves as a placeholder for potentially malicious operations.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While these specific processes alone do not inherently indicate malicious activity, the frequency and context (such as running `whoami.exe`) suggest potential enumeration activities.
   - Execution of another PowerShell process noted in the Sysmon logs (Process ID: 5100) which corresponds to the suspicious PowerShell registry access.

3. **Additional Sysmon Activity**:
   - A process associated with Microsoft Edge update was observed. While it appears to be a legitimate update task (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.56_129.0.2792.89.exe`), during any investigation, it’s crucial to verify that such updates align with expected maintenance windows and are from legitimate sources.

### Assessment:
Given these observations, the behavior documented in the logs (especially the PowerShell activity manipulating the Userinit registry key) presents multiple red flags typically associated with malicious activity:

- **Suspicious use of registry modification**, particularly on a login-related key which can assist in persistent threats.
- **Elevated Use of PowerShell** to execute commands that change system configurations.
- **Potential Enumeration** or reconnaissance using command prompts like `whoami.exe`, **indicating a further investigation is warranted**.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The identified registry modification is indicative of an unauthorized and possible malicious alteration for persistence. The behavior signifies more than just harmless testing or misconfiguration.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent any potential spread or communication with a Command and Control (C&C) server.
2. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the source and intent of the modification, and check for any additional unauthorized changes or malware.
3. **Log Review**: Scan for similar activity across other systems to rule out a wider compromise.
4. **Incident Response**: Engage with the incident response team to remediate the system, restore any modified configurations, and monitor for any further suspicious activity.
5. **Security Measures**: Strengthen PowerShell logging, enable strict execution policies, and review user access policies to reduce the risk of similar breaches in the future. 

These steps aim to address the immediate threat while preventing future occurrences."
Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- The PowerShell logs reveal a sequence of commands executed using `powershell.exe`. The commands involve:
  - Importing the `AzureAD` module.
  - Creating a secure string and a credential object for the user `jonh@contoso.com`.
  - Connecting to `AzureAD` using these credentials.
  - Searching and accessing an Azure Service Principal named ""SuperSP"".
  - Generating a self-signed certificate with a validity of two days.
  - Attempting to create a Service Principal Key Credential with this certificate.
  - Reconnecting to AzureAD using this certificate, indicating successful application hijacking, as evidenced by the message ""Application Hijacking worked.""

#### **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Multiple occurrences of processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are noted.
- Critical attention is required on the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line containing credential creation and connectivity to AzureAD.
- The `wevtutil.exe` is used, potentially for exporting logs which can signify attempts to hide malicious activities.
- The user, `SERVER002\admin_test`, seems to have high integrity level processes initiated, which might suggest usage of elevated privileges.

#### **Key Observations:**
- **Application Hijacking:** The PowerShell logs explicitly mention ""Application Hijacking worked,"" demonstrating a likely scenario of a successful hijacking attempt using a generated certificate.
- **Credential Theft/Persistence:** There is a clear attempt to create a credential and service principal key using a self-signed certificate, which can provide persistent access to resources.
- **Use of Common Windows Utilities:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` with the intention of modifying Azure AD services and logs manipulation suggests malicious intent or artifact cleaning efforts.
  
### Assessment:
The behavior in the logs suggests a coordinated and intentional attempt to gain unauthorized access to AzureAD resources, establish persistence via certificate-based authentication, and potential artifact tampering using event log utility commands. 

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The event logs contain clear evidence of malicious activity indicated by unauthorized AzureAD manipulation via PowerShell commands, credential creation attempts, and explicit mention of ""Application Hijacking.""

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Revoke any self-signed certificates and credentials created in this period.
   - Investigate if unauthorized configurations or changes were made to Azure resources.
   - Conduct a thorough audit of affected Azure accounts and services.
   
2. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced PowerShell logging and monitoring for unauthorized executions.
   - Use security best practices, like multi-factor authentication and just-in-time access, to enhance Azure AD security.
   
3. **Forensic and Deeper Analysis:**
   - Collect and preserve all evidence for a deeper forensic analysis.
   - Perform a full review of the server `Server002` to check for additional malicious tools or indicators of lateral movement.
   - Ensure comprehensive review and patching or hardening of any identified vulnerabilities."
Creating Boot Verification Program Key for application execution during successful boot,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are notable:

1. **Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - There's a command executed: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\BootVerificationProgram /v ImagePath /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe""`.
   - This kind of registry modification via the command line is suspicious, as it attempts to alter boot verification paths, potentially redirecting or affecting startup processes, which is a technique that might be leveraged for persistence by malware.

2. **Usage of High Integrity Level:**
   - Commands executed with a high integrity level (`cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` with high integrity) suggest that the processes were running with elevated privileges. While not inherently malicious, the context of modifying critical registry keys suggests potential abuse of these privileges.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Multiple log entries indicate manipulation of system time by `svchost.exe`. Time is altered from ""2024-10-27 16:17:01.0975925"" to ""2024-10-27 16:16:55.5541718"" which can be indicative of an effort to conceal activity or influence time-sensitive applications or policy enforcement.

4. **Execution of System Tools:**
   - Frequent executions of tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, are logged under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These may be typical administrative actions, but in aggregate, especially given the time changes and registry edits, they could suggest reconnaissance or probing actions by a potential attacker.

5. **Multiple Logon Events and Privilege Assignments:**
   - The user `admin_test` is seen gaining privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc.) which are generally associated with advanced administrative or system-level controls.
   - The log shows both logout (`EventID 4634`) and logon events (`EventID 4624`), with elevated privileges and unusual access patterns for user `admin_test`.

Based on these observations, the collection of behaviors—registry modifications, time manipulation, and heightened privilege usage—strongly suggest suspicious activity rather than regular administrative action, especially given the context in which these operations occur.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Next Steps and Recommendations:
- **Conduct a detailed forensic analysis:** Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or credential theft.
- **Review system integrity:** Examine other systems for similar patterns of registry modification and time manipulation.
- **Enhance monitoring:** Increase logging and alerting on registry changes and admin account activities.
- **Isolate and clean:** If unauthorized changes or malware are confirmed, isolate the system(s) involved and remediate the threat.
- **Update policies:** Evaluate the access controls and privilege allocations for administrative roles to mitigate future risks."
