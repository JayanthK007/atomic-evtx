Modify VSS Service Permissions,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several key observations can be made:

1. **Time Manipulation:** The logs contain multiple events related to time changes on the system (Event ID 4616 in the security log and Event ID 1 in the system log), indicating that the system time was altered. This is highlighted by the `svchost.exe` process repeatedly changing the system time backward. Such actions can be suspicious as attackers sometimes manipulate system time to evade detection or alter the sequence of log records.

2. **Privilege Escalation:** The security logs show a sequence of events where the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"" gains multiple high-level privileges (Event ID 4672). The list of privileges includes SeDebugPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, and others, which can be used by attackers to perform malicious actions on a system.

3. **Unusual Command Execution:** The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of a command by `cmd.exe` involving the `sc sdset VSS ...` command line. This command modifies permissions on the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), potentially to allow access to system components generally restricted. Such an action could be a precursor to an attack that involves modifying or deleting system backups.

4. **Usage of System Utilities:** Frequent executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user ""admin_test"" are shown in the Sysmon logs. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their usage in close succession and without clear indications of purpose may imply information gathering or system reconnaissance activity.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates:** Several Sysmon log entries (Event ID 1) show the execution of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update. These appear to be benign as they are signed by Microsoft and perform expected update activities.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
- The manipulation of system time is an anomaly that could be indicative of attempts to obscure tracking activities or tamper with recorded logs.
- Gaining high privileges could be an indication of privilege escalation typically associated with compromised accounts.
- The unusual modification of VSS permissions suggests potential preparation for activities consistent with malware or ransomware behavior (as they often target backup systems).

Considering these observations, the log activities present a probable indication of suspicious behavior needing further investigation. Therefore, the recommended resolution is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" account activities, including validating recent system usage and changes by this account.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of associated systems to search for known indicators of compromise or malicious artifacts.
- Implement monitoring focused on further time manipulations, privilege grants, and unusual command executions, including logging and alerting mechanisms to capture real-time activities.
- Review and restrict the permissions for sensitive services like VSS to ensure they align with the principle of least privilege.
- Engage with the IT team to perform a thorough check of integrity by comparing against baseline snapshots where applicable, and if suspicion remains, consider isolating the system for comprehensive investigation."
Disable System Restore Through Registry,"Based on the provided logs, here are my findings:

1. **Processes Launched by User `admin_test`**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears benign. These utilities are usually used for confirming system details and user identity, which might be typical for administrative tasks.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` with no clear malicious intent as they are often used for querying and managing event logs.

2. **Registry Modifications**:
   - There are entries indicating the execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to disable system restore configurations via `reg.exe`. This could potentially be suspicious as disabling system restore is a tactic used by attackers to prevent recovery of a compromised system. This action could potentially disable rollback to previous states where the system was not compromised, making it easier for an attacker to maintain their foothold.

3. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - The logs show multiple executions of Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`) which seem consistent with the activities of updating or maintaining Edge browser versions. These processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for legitimate update activities by system components.
   - Although the Edge updates appear routine, they should be verified to ensure they correspond to normal patch management or update schedules.

4. **Indicators of Automated Task Execution**:
   - Some processes, such as Edge updates and service executions, could be automated tasks, possibly triggered by a scheduled task or update routine.
   
5. **Absence of Critical Logs from Security and System Logs**:
   - There is a noted absence of entries in the System and Security logs, making it difficult to corroborate activities or identify potential unauthorized access or privilege escalations.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

- **Suspicious Activity**: The disabling of system restore points through registry modifications by `SERVER002\admin_test` raises a red flag. While there could be legitimate reasons for this change, it is generally suspicious and should be investigated further.
- **Understanding Intent**: It's advisable to interview the `admin_test` account holder or associated team to understand why these changes were made. Check if there was any particular maintenance or configuration task that justified this action.
- **Review Update Schedules**: Ensure that the Edge update activities align with organizational policies for software updates.
- **Correlate with Threat Intelligence**: Cross-reference any unusual SHA256 hashes from processes with threat intelligence databases to check for known malware signatures.
- **Enhance Monitoring**: Ensure that Security and System logs are audited to provide better visibility into activities that may signify system changes or unauthorized access attempts.

**Resolution**: Based on the current analysis, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities, particularly related to registry changes, need further investigation to determine if they were authorized and necessary actions, or if they are indicative of potential malicious activity."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the machine ""Server002"", several events stand out as indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Use of Vssadmin and Wmic Commands**:
   - Notable Sysmon events show the execution of `vssadmin.exe` with the command `list shadows` and `wmic.exe` with the command `shadowcopy delete`. These commands are often associated with malicious activities such as ransomware attacks, where Volume Shadow Copies are deleted to prevent recovery using backups.
   - The command sequence begins with PowerShell initiating the `vssadmin.exe list shadows` command to check if shadow copies exist, followed by a `cmd.exe` initiated `wmic.exe shadowcopy delete` command to delete these copies.

2. **Privilege Execution and High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes in question (`vssadmin.exe`, `wmic.exe`) were executed under a high integrity level and were likely running with administrative privileges (indicated by `IntegrityLevel: High`).
   - These actions were carried out by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"", suggesting that the account had elevated privileges necessary to delete shadow copies.

3. **Unusual User Activity**:
   - The user account ""SERVER002\admin_test"" was used to execute potentially harmful operations, indicating either misuse of legitimate administrative credentials or possible compromise of these credentials by an attacker.

4. **Patterns Indicating Malicious Intent**:
   - The coordinated use of benign system utilities like `vssadmin` and `wmic` in this manner, driven by script automation involving PowerShell, is a common pattern observed in ransomware attacks.
   - The actions were executed within a very short time span, suggesting automated or scripted execution rather than manual user actions.

Assessment:
- The combination of executing commands to list and delete Volume Shadow Copies, especially following each other in a short sequence, raises a strong suspicion of malicious intent, potentially indicating preparation for or execution of a ransomware attack.

Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - Based on the observed behavior that aligns with known malicious patterns, including the use of system utilities to delete backups, which are typical of ransomware operations. Immediate remediation actions should be taken to contain and mitigate any potential damage.

Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Steps**:
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent the potential spread of malicious activity.
  - Conduct thorough offline forensic analysis to confirm the scope of the intrusion.
  - Examine other systems and logs for similar patterns that may indicate lateral movement or wider compromise.
  
- **Investigation and Mitigation**:
  - Identify and secure any compromised credentials.
  - Check for persistence mechanisms that may have been established on the system.
  - Review backup strategies and ensure off-site backups are resilient to deletion attempts.
  
- **Future Prevention**:
  - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring for privileged accounts.
  - Use EDR solutions to detect and alert on the suspicious use of admin-level utilities.
  - Educate users about phishing and credential theft to reduce risk of initial compromise."

   - Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus (KB2267602) is benign. It indicates routine updating of antivirus definitions.
  
2. **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events:**
   - Multiple events related to system time adjustment by svchost.exe are captured. There is a minor time adjustment involved but no unusual patterns or anomalies noted.

### Application Log Observations:
1. **SecurityCenter Event:**
   - Windows Defender is reported as active, which aligns with normal security measures.
  
2. **EdgeUpdate Events:**
   - The Edge Update service stopped. Frequent service stops could be worthy of further checks but often indicate routine update or maintenance, especially when aligned with update installations as seen in the logs.

### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Multiple entries show conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The actions performed by these utilities seem consistent with typical administrative tasks.
   - Whoami.exe and hostname.exe are known benign applications often used to gather basic system information.
   - A potentially anomalous process involves disabling Windows system restore points using `schtasks.exe`. This action requires administrative privileges and might indicate malicious intent to prevent system recovery.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes executed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The EdgeUpdate entries seem consistent with the software's update cycle.

### Security Log Observations:
- **Security Audit Success:**
  - Normal successful audit logs related to time changes, using svchost for operation. No evidence of privilege escalation or other malicious actions.

### Potential Indicator of Compromise:
- **Scheduled Task Modification:**
  - The disabling of a system restore task using ""schtasks.exe"" is suspicious. If this was not a planned administrative action, it might indicate an attempt to make the system less resilient to recovery efforts during an attack.

### Assessment and Recommendations:
- While the majority of entries appear benign and indicative of routine system operations and updates, the disabling of the system restore point schedule stands out as suspicious. This action should be further investigated. Specifically, confirm whether this task change was a legitimate administrative procedure, especially since it carries risks of decreasing the system's ability to rollback malicious changes.
  
### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain a suspicious action (disabling of system restore tasks) that warrants further investigation to confirm intent and context."
ESXi - Avoslocker enumerates VMs and forcefully kills VMs,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Potentially Malicious Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** The Sysmon log shows that `powershell.exe` was executed by the `admin_test` user. PowerShell is often used by malicious actors to execute scripts that can compromise a system. However, no command-line arguments are visible, and this alone does not confirm malicious intent without additional context. Further investigation would be warranted to determine the purpose of this execution.
   
   - **Suspicious Use of CMD and Plink:** There is a specific command execution using `cmd.exe` that involves `plink.exe` to make an SSH connection as the `root` user with the password plaintext in the command line: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c echo """" | ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh  -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt""
     ```
     This command is highly suspicious for several reasons:
     - The usage of `plink.exe` to SSH into another system with the `root` account and a plaintext password is risky and typically indicates unauthorized or malicious behavior.
     - The referenced file `esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt` suggests possible ransomware or malicious intent, especially using a known ransomware group name (""avoslocker"").

2. **Normal System Activity:**
   - **Edge Update Process Events:** These logs contain multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. This appears to be routine system maintenance or updates processes, and there is no immediate indication of malicious activity from these processes alone.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The activity involving PowerShell and especially the `plink.exe` command line is concerning. The ability to execute remote commands or connect externally as `root` using plaintext credentials can lead to system compromise or serve as a step in a more significant attack, possibly involving lateral movement or data exfiltration.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Use of administrative tools for potential unauthorized access and data manipulation.
- The possibility of malware execution or ransomware activity indicated by the command structure and the file referenced.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Containment:** If possible, isolate the system (Server002) to prevent any further potential spread of malicious activities.
   - **Credentials Audit:** Investigate the credentials used for SSH access (`root`) and consider resetting passwords, especially given the plaintext usage.
   - **Log Analysis:** Conduct deep-dive analysis on PowerShell activities to uncover any executed scripts or further details.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - **Malware Analysis:** Examine the file `esx_avoslocker_kill_vm.txt` and the plink session for signs of malware or tampered files/scripts.
   - **Network Monitoring:** Check network logs for anomalies similar to unauthorized connections to other internal/external systems.

3. **Security Controls:**
   - Enforce stricter PowerShell logging and security measures.
   - Consider implementing alerts for the execution of unusual command lines using tools like `plink.exe`.

**Final Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of suspicious command-line execution involving `plink.exe` with plaintext password usage, combined with possible ransomware indicators, strongly suggests malicious activity. Immediate action should be taken to address this threat."
Replace Desktop Wallpaper,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **System Logs:**

   - There are multiple entries related to time changes and the use of `svchost.exe`, which can be typical for Windows time synchronization. There are no direct indications that these relate to suspicious activities. The processes run under NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE, which aligns with expected behavior for time-sync processes.

2. **PowerShell Logs:**

   - The PowerShell logs reveal a script execution for changing the wallpaper on the computer by downloading an image file from an external URL (`https://file.com/wp-content/uploads/file-file-Logo.png`). This kind of behavior is suspicious because it involves downloading and setting a file from an external source without apparent pre-authorization or a legitimate reason.
   - The PowerShell script changes the desktop wallpaper following the download and they make use of .NET compiled code on the fly using `Add-Type`. This technique is often associated with potentially malicious activities. The execution of such a script could indicate an initial stage of an attack or unauthorized alteration on the system.

3. **Application Logs:**

   - These logs are mostly related to Microsoft Edge updates. There are no obvious signs of anomalies related to these logs. Updates from Microsoft Edge may run as part of routine maintenance.

4. **Security Logs:**

   - The security logs are aligned with the rest of the system logs correlating to time changes. They do not explicitly indicate a compromise but should be monitored as time alterations can sometimes be linked to attempts to obscure certain activities.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**

   - The logs document a number of process creations including those related to Windows services and Microsoft Edge Update processes. 
   - Particularly interesting is the invocation of PowerShell which matches the behavior noted in the PowerShell logs of executing a downloaded script to potentially alter settings. This strengthens the suspicion raised by the PowerShell logs.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**

The behavior observed in the PowerShell logs is suspicious, as it involves downloading a file from an external website and executing a script without any provided justification. Combined with compiling and running on-the-fly code with `Add-Type`, this indicates an elevated risk which is often seen in malicious activities.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The activity doesn't conclusively prove malicious intent as it may have been conducted by a third-party application or a misconfigured script. However, the use of such techniques, common in malware, warrants further investigation.
- Action Recommended: Monitor the system for further unexpected behaviors, check for any unauthorized changes to the system, and potentially run a comprehensive anti-malware scan of the system. Consider restricting PowerShell script execution until the investigation is complete and ensure that external communications are limited to trusted endpoints."
Remove Account From Domain Admin Group,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations highlight suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of PowerShell being executed (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) by a user with the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - Specifically, there is a Powershell script being executed that is attempting to remove a user from the ""Domain Admins"" group, which is a clear indication of privilege manipulation.
   - The `CommandLine` executed is suspicious: `ConvertTo-SecureString -String password -AsPlainText -Force`, potentially revealing attempts to manipulate credentials or automate privilege changes maliciously.

2. **Processes Executed:**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed as `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` can be legitimate, frequent execution might be used to clear logs to cover tracks.
   - The `whoami.exe` execution under a high integrity level could lead to attempts to identify the current security context, which could be indicative of reconnaissance efforts.

3. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - Several processes, especially those involving PowerShell operations, are being executed under high integrity, suggesting they are running with administrative privileges.

4. **Anomalous Behavior:**
   - The operation of powerful administrative tools like wevtutil and the execution patterns of conhost in conjunction with PowerShell suggest possible attempts to maintain persistence, execute commands, or establish a foothold on the system.
   - Use of a PowerShell script to manipulate Active Directory group memberships without proper documentation or authorization violates standard IT operation practices.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The logs imply that there is likely an unauthorized or malicious attempt to manipulate privileged accounts and potentially steal or change critical data using PowerShell.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given the combination of unauthorized PowerShell scripting aimed at manipulating domain administrator privileges, the high integrity levels of the processes, and suspicious command-line usage, the activity is deemed malicious.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Revoke `SERVER002\\admin_test` account credentials immediately to prevent further unauthorized activity.
   - Reset passwords and review other accesses for the account `domain\\super_user`.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of this account’s activity and all systems it has accessed.
   - Review audit logs where available to identify any other unauthorized changes or access.

3. **Secure Environment:**
   - Reinforce network security monitoring to detect similar patterns quickly.
   - Educate the administrative staff on security best practices regarding PowerShell usage and regular audits.

Delete User - Windows,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### System Log

1. **Time Synchronization**: Multiple events are observed where time synchronization activities are carried out by `svchost.exe`. The OldTime and NewTime are updated, which indicates regular time-service activity. These events (`EventID: 24` and `EventID: 1` for `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`) do not typically indicate malicious behavior unless there is a substantial time discrepancy being repeatedly corrected without expected cause.

2. **Network Time Protocol (NTP)**: The system is synchronizing with `time.windows.com`, which is a default NTP server for Windows. This is expected behavior for maintaining accurate system time.

#### Application Log

1. **Software Protection Platform**: The log entry generated by the Software Protection Platform Service (`EventID: 16384`) hints at a regular check-in or state monitoring update, which is customary for ensuring licensing and activation compliance.

#### Security Log

1. **Time Change Events**: Similar to System Log, there are Security-auditing entries (`EventID: 4616`) relating to time changes which align with the Kernel-General events. The time changes seem to originate from a process with ID `0x944`, which aligns with the system process responsible for time synchronization.

2. **Privilege Assignments**: The `admin_test` user receives several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc.), as indicated by `EventID: 4672`. This is critical and could signify a risk if this user is not supposed to have elevated access.

3. **User Addition and Deletion**: There are actions indicating the creation and subsequent removal of `fileUser`, evidenced by events `4720`, `4726`, and confirmations of privilege assignments or denials (`4728`, `4729`). The swift addition and removal of users might suggest abnormal activity, potentially covering tracks or testing access.

4. **Login and Logout Events**: There are login (`4624`) and logout (`4634`) events concerning the `admin_test` user. The presence of external workstation references (""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"") indicates remote login access, which could be standard unless the IP is unrecognized or unexpected.

#### Sysmon Log

1. **Scheduled Task Execution**: Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are being executed, including an update ping and installation sequence. This is generally normal for managing Microsoft Edge updates unless noted versions are linked to vulnerabilities or abnormal update schedules are detected.

2. **Command Execution**: Commands involving `cmd.exe` run a sequence adding and deleting a user (`fileUser`). This behavior is suspicious as typical legitimate use cases do not simultaneously add and delete users rapidly.

3. **Potential Malicious Indicators**: The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` seems benign but could be used in scripting automated tasks. The execution of these utilities alongside overall user management activities spikes suspicion towards potential reconnaissance or control actions.

### Assessment:

Based on the log analysis, several activities stand out as suspicious due to unusual user management, rapid user privilege escalation, temporary account creation and deletion, and remote logons. While some logs, like NTP synchronizations and Microsoft Edge updates, are categorically benign, the user activities and privilege enhancements merit a deeper investigation.

### Recommended Actions:

- **Review `admin_test` activities**: Verify the legitimacy of the recent activities by `admin_test`, particularly with elevated privileges.
- **Cross-Check Remote Access**: Validate if access from ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"" was expected and authenticated.
- **Investigate User Account Actions**: Look into the rationale behind the creation and deletion of `fileUser`. Check for any other changes or commands executed during this session.
- **Review System Scripts**: Ensure no unauthorized automated scripts are running on the system that executes unexpected user or time-change activities. 

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activities that do not conclusively confirm maliciousness but align with potential compromise patterns that require thorough vetting to ensure system integrity and security compliance. Further investigation into user intentions and remote connections is crucial to maintain robust security posture."
Overwrite deleted data on C drive,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Security Logs Analysis
1. **Event ID 4616**: Multiple system time changes were logged. These were carried out by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Typically, frequent time changes can be suspicious as this is sometimes used by malware to evade security protocols. However, the context of these changes is important as well.

2. **Event ID 4624**: Suggests logon activities. Of interest:
   - A SYSTEM logon (LogonType 5) represents a service logon, which is not unusual by itself.
   - A NTLM logon (LogonType 3) by the user `admin_test` from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` could be indicative of remote access which should be validated if this was authorized or expected behavior.

3. **Event ID 4672**: Privilege assignments for SYSTEM and `admin_test` accounts include high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` which allows for debugging of any process, potentially allowing escalations or sensitive data access. While SYSTEM owning these are standard, their presence under `admin_test` should be verified as appropriate to the user's role.

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis
1. **Process Creation** and **Process Termination** captured:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` (Event ID: 5), typically used to manage event logs, launched multiple instances which require checking to ensure these commands were intentionally triggered.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` followed by `cipher.exe` with command `/w:C:` is highly suspicious. This command line is used to securely delete data on a disk, including all free space on disk C. This activity could indicate an attempt to erase traces of previous actions.

2. **High Integrity Level**: Several processes executed at a High Integrity Level by the `admin_test` account, including sensitive operations like `cipher.exe`, require investigation to ensure they were legitimate.

#### System Logs Analysis
- Time reset activities align with security logs for event ID 4616, primarily attributed to `svchost.exe`. Context is crucial; if synchronizing with a time server (`time.windows.com`), it might be normal. Otherwise, repeated unsanctioned time changes could be suspicious.

### Assessment and Conclusion
The logs demonstrate potentially malicious activities warranting further scrutiny:

1. **Suspicious Activities Detected**:
   - Execution of `cipher.exe` for secure data wiping without known legitimate purposes is commonly associated with malware or malicious insider attempts to hide tracks.
   - Unexpected privilege usage and remote logon events need validation against normal activity patterns for `admin_test`.
2. **Time Changes** without clear justification need to be clarified.

### Guidance on Next Steps
- **Immediate Review of User Activities**: Confirm legitimacy of operations performed by the user `admin_test` around the suspicious timestamps. Validate if execution of `cipher.exe` was authorized.
- **Account Consistency Check**: Ensure `admin_test` credentials were not compromised. Verify access logs and perform additional monitoring on that account.
- **System Hardening**: Enforce stricter monitoring and validation on high integrity process executions and privilege utilizations.
- **Further System Forensics**: Consider capturing more detailed endpoint data to confirm the potential compromise and pinpoint root cause and affected scope.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the logs, particularly the use of `cipher.exe` for secure deletion in combination with abnormal logons and probable privilege misuse, it is consistent with indicators of malicious activity. Immediate action is recommended to confirm a breach and contain any potential threats.

"
Data Encrypted with GPG4Win,"Analysis of the provided logs reveals several points of consideration regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - The use of `powershell.exe` in conjunction with `cmd.exe` to run `gpg.exe` for encrypting a file (`$env:temp\\test.txt`) is noteworthy. While the use of GnuPG for encryption can be legitimate, wrapping it in PowerShell and cmd indicates the use of multiple layers, which can be suspicious, as attackers sometimes use similar methods to obfuscate their actions.

2. **Execution of Built-in System Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were logged. The repetitive execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used for managing event logs, could denote an attempt to tamper with the logs or execute scheduled tasks. However, the logs do not directly show any deletion or clearing commands typically associated with malicious activity. 

3. **User Privileges and Security Logs**:
   - The security logs indicate several `4798` and `4799` events, showing account enumeration and group membership enumeration actions performed via `CompatTelRunner.exe`. This event is often part of routine system telemetry but could be exploited for reconnaissance by attackers.

4. **Use of Other System Tools**:
   - The launches of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typical for verifying environment context and checks after potentially malicious actions. These are benign on their own but could be part of a post-exploitation script.

5. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - Many logs show processes operating at `High` integrity levels, typical for an admin user but also for administrative abuse.
   
6. **CommandLine Audit**:
   - The execution of complex command lines, especially those that stack utility executions (PowerShell, cmd, and third-party apps like GnuPG), can be indicative of scripted activities often used in attacks.

### Assessment:
- Overall, there is a pattern of activities indicating potential scripting and command automation, which could suggest unauthorized or unauthorized administrative actions. Specifically, the PowerShell to cmd to GnuPG pipeline is unusual and merits. However, the absence of direct harmful commands or missing typical red flags such as unauthorized log clearing, direct privilege escalations more limits these findings.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: While there is no smoking gun—i.e., explicit evidence of malicious activity—the complexity and nature of the actions, particularly surrounding PowerShell usage and system utility executions, raise enough concern to warrant further investigation. It is important to review who initiated the series of actions and for what purpose. Additionally, monitoring for future anomalous activities and examining the intentions behind file encryptions should be a next step.

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a deeper dive into who executed these commands and decipher whether these actions align with normal user or administrative behavior.
- Consider cross-referencing with network logs to determine if there was any corresponding suspicious external communication.
- Enable close monitoring and alerting on further occurrences of complex PowerShell and cmd.exe interactions, particularly those involving file encryption utilities.
- Consider an anti-virus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) scan for additional threats or unauthorized scripts."
ESXi - Terminates VMs using pkill,"Based on the provided log files and entries, I have conducted an analysis to determine if there are any indicators of malicious activity.

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Observation of several process creations involving standard Windows utilities such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are commonly used tools that can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.
   - `plink.exe` (a component of PuTTY, commonly used for SSH connections) is executed with a command line that includes parameters for connecting to a remote server (e.g., `-l ""root""`, `-pw ""pass""`). This is particularly suspicious because it involves using credentials for root access and executing a command script (`esx_pkill.txt`). This could be indicative of a remote administration or potential lateral movement attempt.
   - Frequent invocations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line arguments typical for update processes, indicating routine software update operations which appear benign.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of service stop logs related to `edgeupdate` service. These entries alone are not inherently suspicious, as they can occur routinely during system maintenance or updates.

3. **Observations:**
   - The usage of `plink.exe` is the most concerning aspect in the logs. Its presence suggests possible unauthorized usage or potentially malicious activity if the execution was not pre-approved or expected as part of normal operations.
   - The execution pattern of `cmd.exe` executing `plink.exe` with hardcoded credentials is typically characteristic of automated scripts or malicious processes aiming to access remote machines.

### Assessment
- **BENIGN:** Regular operations such as Edge updates appearing in the logs.
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The `plink.exe` execution indicates activity that requires further investigation to rule out unauthorized access or a potential security breach.
- **MALICIOUS:** The potential malicious use of a legitimate file (`plink.exe`) in conjunction with credentials suggests activity leaning more toward the malicious spectrum if the action was not authorized.

### Resolution
The logs contain **SUSPICIOUS** activity that requires further investigation. The execution of `plink.exe` with specific SSH credentials is not typically seen in standard user behavior and requires additional scrutiny. Verify the legitimacy of this execution and the origin to determine if malicious activity is indeed occurring.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Identify and confirm the purpose of the `plink.exe` execution. Determine if the operation was part of a legitimate administrative task.
   - Check logs for prior and subsequent connections to the specified remote host to identify potential lateral movement.
   - Review access controls and permissions associated with the `admin_test` account on `SERVER002`, ensuring there are no unauthorized access attempts.
2. **Future Monitoring:**
   - Implement alerts for unusual process executions involving sensitive binaries like `plink.exe`, especially with admin credentials.
   - Continuously monitor for anomalies in privileged account activities.
   - Ensure that updates to critical software such as Microsoft Edge are verified and legitimate. 

Based on the logs and this initial analysis, further investigation is warranted to mitigate any risks associated with unauthorized access or potential security compromises."
Windows - vssadmin Resize Shadowstorage Volume,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Key Observations:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a `PowerShell` command execution involving `vssadmin resize shadowstorage` which is indicative of attempts to manipulate Volume Shadow Copy storage. This type of activity could potentially be used for ransomware or to cover tracks of malicious activity.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are events indicating changes to the system time (`EventID: 4616` in Security logs and `EventID: 1` in System logs). Frequent time changes without a clear need (e.g., daylight savings) can potentially be used to evade detection or alter timestamps for malicious purposes.

3. **Privilege Use and Process Executions:**
   - The presence of `4672` events in the Security log denotes special privilege assignment, which could be standard or potentially abused if not consistent with the user's role.
   - Multiple `Sysmon` events showing legitimate processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` with SYSTEM-level or high-integrity level execution seem normal operationally, but when aggregated with PowerShell usage, they remain suspicious if these commands aren't routine.

4. **Volume Shadow Copy Service:**
   - The `VSSVC.exe` process appears related to the resizing of shadow storage, aligning with the PowerShell command.
   - Coupled with `4799` events, which detail SID and privilege usage, the activity may lean towards malicious if not part of routine maintenance.

#### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **PowerShell Commands**: Often leveraged in attack scenarios for automation of tasks, obfuscation, and direct system changes.
- **Volume Shadow Copy Manipulation**: Common in ransomware attacks to remove backups and hinder recovery.
- **System Time Alterations**: May be used to modify event timeframes to confuse forensic investigations.
- **Special Privileges**: While usage could be normal for system processes, any deviation or unexpected use could be malicious.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the investigation of logs:

- **PowerShell with VSS operations** correlates with techniques employed by ransomware or intruders removing forensic evidence and/or backups.
- **Frequent time change events** raise a red flag for potential evasion techniques.
- **Absence of external connections or data exfiltration evidence** but internal changes suggest more reconnaissance or preparation phase or a stealth operational phase, commonly aligned with adversarial tactics.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the necessity and legitimacy of the `vssadmin` command executions.
   - Correlate activities with any scheduled or administrator-approved tasks.
   - Check for specific time change permissions, ensuring only authorized processes or personnel can execute them.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for PowerShell executions (`Script Block Logging`).
   - Review access privileges and accounts used during SIDs and privileges escalations related logs.

3. **User and Network Verification:**
   - Check network connections and user access logs for any unusual activities around the timestamps of identified events.
   - Verify activities align with the users' responsibilities and tasks.

4. **Comprehensive Investigation:**
   - Conduct a larger scope review of systems connected or interacting with SERVER002 to ascertain any lateral movement or propagation.
   - Use internal threat intelligence tools to check against the observed behavior and hashes.

Given the context and findings, further investigation is required to determine the precise nature and extent of potential threats or establish the security of the environment."
Windows - Disable Windows Recovery Console Repair,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - The log entry from the Software Protection Platform Service (EventID 16384) indicates some routine logging presumably by a rules engine. There’s nothing unusual or related to potential malicious activity based on this single log entry. This type of log often involves licensing and related checks by Windows.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The entries with EventID 4616 indicate a system time change. This could be routine if it fits a pattern of daylight saving time adjustments or synchronization with a time server, but multiple time changes within such a close timeframe can be suspicious. However, there’s no immediate indicator of malicious intent from just this information, and it aligns with expected operations if NTP synchronization occurred with time.windows.com.
   
3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` show a series of benign Windows utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) running. These are common and not suspicious on their own.
   - A Sysmon event indicates the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command: `bcdedit.exe /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures & bcdedit.exe /set {default} recoveryenabled no`. This is suspicious as it alters the boot configuration to ignore boot failures and disable automatic recovery options, which is a known technique to suppress system alerts and exploit persistence.
   - The integrity level of executions is high, indicating these actions are performed with potentially elevated privileges.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times is noted. This utility is used to retrieve and manage event logs. While not inherently malicious, its appearance in the context of other suspicious activities merits further scrutiny.

4. **System Log:**
   - Kernel-General events relate to timezone adjustments and other system operations. The presence of events without any conspicuous issues suggests typical operational changes consistent with configurations or timezone adjustments.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The logs indicate potentially suspicious and malicious behavior rather than benign activity. The use of the `bcdedit` command to alter boot configurations strongly suggests an attempt to mask failures during system boot and potentially prevent users or system administrators from noticing irregularities.
  
**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Altered boot policies can prevent system recovery and obscure malware presence, leading to persistent compromise and undisclosed vulnerabilities that hamper incident response measures.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate investigation and verification on `Server002` should be performed to assess the purpose and context of the `bcdedit` command usage.
- Review other related logs and configurations on Server002 for signs of unauthorized access or changes.
- Consider isolating the machine for in-depth forensic analysis to identify any further potential breaches, malware, or unauthorized configurations.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given the command altering boot configurations and the context of possible suppression of system alerts, this qualifies as malicious activity warranting rapid response and remediation."

Data Encrypt Using DiskCryptor,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` (EventRecordID: 18002). PowerShell is often used by threat actors for malicious purposes due to its powerful scripting capabilities and its ability to execute code remotely.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs also show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing Windows event logs, but it can be used by attackers to clear logs or manipulate them to cover tracks. This behavior is repeated multiple times (EventRecordIDs: 18006, 18010, 18014, 18018, and 18022).

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with a Suspicious Command**:
   - There is an instance of `cmd.exe` executing with a command line that includes a reference to `""%PROGRAMFILES%\\dcrypt\\dcrypt.exe""` (EventRecordID: 18032). The presence of potentially third-party or unknown executables being invoked through command line can be a red flag for suspicious activity.

4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - The logs show multiple `conhost.exe` executions, which is a legitimate Windows process. However, frequent and rapid spawning especially related to command-line interactions can be indicative of command-and-control activity or attempts to obscure command line execution.

5. **Normal Activity Noted**:
   - The logs document regular activity for Windows Search components like `SearchIndexer.exe`, `SearchProtocolHost.exe`, and `SearchFilterHost.exe` which appears normal.
   - Microsoft Edge updates and installations are also logged (EventIDs from 18037 to 18054), which are consistent with legitimate software update activities.

6. **Security Log - Event 4799**:
   - The Security log records an event indicating privileges related to user group changes (EventID: 4799). This is linked to the execution of Microsoft Edge's `setup.exe`, suggesting typical user or group management which is unlikely to be directly malicious without additional context.

**Assessment**:
- The frequent execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and the suspicious command line argument involving `dcrypt.exe` are key highlights that require additional scrutiny.
- The specific combination of tools and their manner of use could signal a potential breach or post-exploitation activity.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review and analyze the command history and scripts executed via PowerShell to identify any obfuscated commands or malicious scripts.
   - Investigate the origin and purpose of `dcrypt.exe` to determine whether it is legitimate or if it is a malicious executable.
   - Evaluate user activity for the account `admin_test` around the time of these events to establish if actions were authorized and match their profile.

2. **Immediate Attention**:
   - Check for any signs of data exfiltration or lateral movement that might have been missed.
   - Consider isolating the affected system if `dcrypt.exe` or unusual activities are confirmed to be malicious.

3. **Preventive Measures**:

   - Educate users about safe practices and indicators of potential system compromise.
   - Conduct a full security audit and assess for any unauthorized changes in privileges, particularly on high-value accounts like `admin_test`. 

These initial steps should help clarify whether the observed patterns are indicative of a more severe issue or an isolated incident in need of rectification."
Windows - wbadmin Delete Windows Backup Catalog,"Analysis of the provided logs shows both routine behaviors and a few potentially suspicious actions. The logs cover events on a Windows system, mostly involving various Windows services and components.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Backup Catalog Deletion**:
    - In the Sysmon log, there are events where the command `""cmd.exe"" /c wbadmin delete catalog -quiet` is executed. This command deletes the Windows backup catalog quietly without prompting. 
    - The use of `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet` could be an attempted cleanup of backup records which might be malicious if unauthorized, aimed at destroying evidence of previous states, making recovery more difficult after a potential attack.

2. **High-Level Privileges**:
    - Security log EventID `4672` indicates that privileges were assigned to the account used in these actions, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege`, which are powerful and often associated with administrative tasks or potentially exploitative actions if obtained illicitly.

3. **Frequent Execution of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
    - Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and associated `conhost.exe` over short time frames. While `wevtutil` is used for managing event logs, its repeated execution could imply attempts to query, clear, or control event logs which might be suspicious if out of the ordinary for regular operations.

4. **EdgeUpdater Services**:
    - Repeated start and completion events related to `Microsoft Edge Update` process. While not inherently malicious, the frequency and volume of these processes can sometimes indicate software being updated or managed improperly, though this might simply be routine update behavior.

### Indicative of Malicious Activity:

- The execution of `wbadmin delete catalog` is the most concerning activity. This command's quiet execution suggests an attempt to suppress alerts or avoid detection by removing backup traces. If this action was not initiated by a known administrative task or scheduled backup maintenance, it could indicate potentially malevolent intent.

### Assessment:

Given the provided details, especially the execution of the backup catalog deletion command without an apparent legitimate reason, the behavior appears to be _potentially harmful_.

### Threats, Risks, and Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Threats and Risks**: The key threat here is data integrity and availability, specifically the risk of unauthorized removal of backup data that can hinder restoration and recovery efforts.
- **Guidance**:
  1. Confirm the legitimacy of the user action related to deleting the backup catalog.
  2. Investigate context around the execution time of `wbadmin delete catalog` — check for who logged in, whether the command was scheduled or manually executed.
  3. Review user roles and permissions, notably those with elevated privileges, to ensure they align with policy and are not abused.
  4. Implement monitoring for similar `wbadmin` commands if not already part of your security posture.

**Resolution**: Based on the findings, this activity could lead to potential compromise or data loss. Further investigation is required to determine the intent and legitimacy of backup deletions and privilege usage.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS"
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### 1. **PowerShell Logs Analysis:**
   - **Observation:** Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of the command `powershell.exe & {Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}}`.
   - **Suspicion:** The command involves deleting shadow copies, which typically isn't a benign operation unless part of legitimate maintenance tasks. This can be associated with ransomware behavior to prevent file recovery.

#### 2. **Security Logs Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4672:** Indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges like `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, amongst others. These privileges allow the user to perform sensitive operations, which can be exploited.
   - **Event ID 4624:** Shows multiple logons using NTLM, with external workstation name `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Logons from an unexpected workstation to an admin account should be investigated.
   - **Event ID 4616:** Involves time change by `svchost.exe`, which could indicate an attempt to tamper with security logs' timestamps, albeit it reflects a rollback indicating system time correction.

#### 3. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - **Processes Observed:**
     - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by user `admin_test`. Although this seems benign, it is often seen in automated scripts or reconnaissance scripts attempting to gather system information after compromise.
     - Notable execution of `VSSVC.exe`, indicating interaction with Volume Shadow Copy Service, consistent with observed PowerShell actions.
     - Multiple logs for `wevtutil.exe`, commonly used for managing event logs, suggesting potential manipulation.
     
#### 4. **Application Logs:**
   - **Event ID 16384:** No direct evidence of malicious activity but relevance to Software Protection Platform events. Alignment with PowerShell activities could signify aspects of activation or environment tampering.

#### 5. **System Logs:**
   - **Time Changes:** Multiple rapid time changes observed, handled by `svchost.exe`, reinforcing the suspicion around potential log tampering, though explanations could exist for correction purposes.

### **Assessment and Conclusion:**

- The concurrent existence of PowerShell actions deleting shadow copies, coupled with privileged logons and potential time tampering behaviors, aligns with tactics often employed by malicious actors attempting to obscure movements and protect persistence mechanisms by eliminating backup recovery measures.

- Given the nature of the activities (especially the deliberate deletion of shadow copies through PowerShell), alongside suspicious external logon sources and privilege escalations, there is a compelling basis to suspect malicious intent.

### **Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** Based on the logs provided, it's appropriate to classify the activity as malicious. The deletion of shadow copies, privileged logons, and other observed behaviors are closely aligned with known attack sequences, potentially indicative of preparations or components of a ransomware attack.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
- Conduct deeper forensic analysis to confirm the scope and origin of intrusion.
- Check for indicators of compromise on other network systems—look for similar PowerShell and NTLM activities.

- Notify relevant stakeholders and prepare for potential incident response engagements, potentially involving reversing any adversary action or restoring from other backup solutions."
Windows - Stop service by killing process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Application Log:
- The log entries indicate the **repeated stopping of the `edgeupdate` service** on Server002. However, these are informational logs and don't directly suggest malicious activity on their own.

### System Log:
- **Service Control Manager Event ID 7031**: This event shows that the Print Spooler service terminated unexpectedly and was set to automatically restart. Termination of critical system services, like the Print Spooler, can sometimes be related to malicious actions, especially if abused by malware to execute or hide malicious tasks. This warrants further investigation but is not conclusive on its own.

### Sysmon Log:
- A series of `WHOAMI`, `HOSTNAME`, and `cmd.exe` processes executed. While they appear benign and are part of regular command-line utilities, the consistent usage pattern, especially `cmd.exe` used to execute `taskkill.exe` to forcibly terminate `spoolsv.exe`, could suggest an attempt to suppress a service that should typically be running, possibly to avoid detection or interference with a process (e.g., malware or unauthorized operations).
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to manipulate event logs to cover tracks, which is suspicious.
- **Execution of `taskkill.exe` to kill `spoolsv.exe`** from a command prompt (`cmd.exe`) is concerning as this isn't typical behavior for legitimate processes without reason and could be indicative of a script or malware attempting to disable part of the system’s functionality, potentially as a precursor to further exploitation.
  
### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4624**: Indicates a successful logon using the SYSTEM account, which is expected for service accounts.
- **Event ID 4672**: Indicates special privileges assigned to a SYSTEM user logon, which includes a list of high-level privileges. While normal for SYSTEM contexts, any unauthorized SYSTEM account use may be alarming.

### Conclusion:
Upon review, none of the log entries individually confirm a malicious event. However, patterns indicative of unauthorized or potentially malicious activity are present.

- **Unusual process activities** like targeted killing of system services (`spoolsv.exe`), the use of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, likely to alter or delete logs, and the restart of the Edge Update in a possibly manipulated environment, are all red flags that warrant a deeper look.
  
### Resolution:
Based on the information and activity patterns from the logs: **SUSPICIOUS.**

### Guidance:
1. **Further investigation recommended**: Continue monitoring for similar activities. Examine other logs to identify any other concurrent suspicious activities.
2. **Check for related service failures**: Investigate whether `spoolsv.exe` has been targeted or stopped outside typical maintenance or patching windows.
3. **Review user activity**: Verify whether `admin_test` accounts or others on Server002 are executing unexpected commands.
4. **Containment and cleansing**: If further suspicious activity is confirmed, consider isolating the machine, scanning for malware, and evaluating network traffic logs for anomalies during log timings."
Windows - Stop service using Service Controller,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several events that require closer scrutiny. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Security Log Observations:**
   - The system time was changed twice (Event ID 4616) by a process running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. While time adjustments can occur due to legitimate reasons, such as synchronization with a time server, unexpected changes might indicate log tampering or an attempt to hide malicious activities. The time change was carried out by `svchost.exe`, a typical host process for Windows services but often used by attackers to masquerade malicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil` is a utility used to manage Windows event logs and is not typically seen running frequently in a short span unless for administrative tasks or potential malicious activity concerning log manipulation.
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests information gathering but these activities are typical for troubleshooting or administrative tasks.
   - A notable entry involves `cmd.exe` executing `sc.exe stop spooler`, suggesting a potential attempt to stop the print spooler service. This could be part of a benign maintenance task but is suspicious without clear justification.
   - Continuous execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated components appears benign as this is typical behavior related to periodic software updates, provided by Microsoft.

3. **Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - **Time Change Events:** As previously mentioned, the unexpected time change managed by `svchost.exe` could indicate an attempt to conceal malicious activity. These changes should be correlated with any unexpected system behavior or unauthorized access during the same timeline.
   - **wevtutil Usage:** While this is a legitimate tool, frequent usage could either represent an administrative task or an attempt to clear event logs to conceal tracks.

### Assessment

- **Time change suspicion:** Though it might be incidental, the occurrence of time adjustments should not be overlooked, considering they can be part of an evasion strategy.
  
- **Stopping of Print Spooler:** In this context, stopping the print spooler service via command line operations should be treated as suspicious unless it can be correlated with identified maintenance activities.

- **Repeated `wevtutil.exe` Invocation:** The presence of multiple executions within a very short timeframe raises a red flag for potential log tampering efforts.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While there are signs of potentially anomalous activities, such as unexpected time changes and repetitive execution of event log utilities, these events alone do not provide conclusive evidence of a malicious compromise. Further investigation is warranted, including but not limited to:
- Confirming if the time changes were authorized and legitimate.
- Understanding the intent and validity behind running `wevtutil.exe` multiple times.
- Clarifying any authorized maintenance actions in the context of stopping the print spooler service.

### Guidance

1. **Investigate Time Change Events:** Verify whether time adjustments correlate with any expected actions or policies. Obtain information from system administrators regarding potential legitimate syncing activities.
   
2. **Evaluate wevtutil Usage:** Conduct a security review with the user `admin_test` to clarify why `wevtutil.exe` was triggered frequently. This should include ensuring logs are intact and verifying against unauthorized modifications.

3. **Verify Spooler Service Stopping:** Consult with administrative staff regarding any legitimate tasks that justify stopping the spooler service at the logged time.

By conducting these further investigatory steps, we can clarify the nature of these events and rule out potential compromise or confirm suspicion of malicious intent."
Windows - Delete Backup Files,"To thoroughly analyze the provided logs, we will examine the Sysmon, Application, and Security event logs for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. Here is the detailed analysis:

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Cmd.exe Deletion Command:**
   - A critical observation is the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c del /s /f /q c:\*.VHD c:\*.bac c:\*.bak c:\*.wbcat c:\*.bkf c:\Backup*.* c:\backup*.* c:\*.set c:\*.win c:\*.dsk`. This command attempts to delete various types of backup files. Such actions are potentially harmful and could indicate data destruction, which is commonly associated with ransomware or insider threat activities.
   
2. **Use of Hostname, whoami, and wevtutil:**
   - Although `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` (`wevtutil.exe` is being run multiple times) are legitimate tools, they are frequently used in reconnaissance and tampering phases during an attack. The repetitive execution of these tools warrants further investigation.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Logon Events:**
   - Multiple logon events with Logon Type 5 (Service) indicate that these are service logons for background processes and do not raise immediate concerns.
   
2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Several instances of Event ID 4672, which indicate special privileges assigned to new logons, are noted. However, no evidence in the logs clearly connects these events to malicious activity, although continuous monitoring of privileged account activities is advisable.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Edge Update:**
   - Multiple events related to ""EdgeUpdate"" stopping indicate normal update activity. However, analyze failed update logs or unusually frequent update tasks for verification.

### Summary and Assessment
- **Suspicious Activity Detected:**
  - The deletion command executed by `cmd.exe` is highly suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious activity. This action aligns with tactics used by malware to destroy backups and increase the impact of the attack.
  
- **Recommendation:**
  - Immediately investigate the machine for signs of compromise, focusing on when and who initiated the deletion command.
  - Review network activity for data exfiltration or communication with known malicious IPs.
  - Backup and recovery procedures should be checked, and potentially impacted systems should be isolated.
  - Increase monitoring on the ""admin_test"" account due to its association with these commands.

Final Resolution **SUSPICIOUS**: Further investigation and monitoring are required to confirm malicious intent and scope."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure CLI,"Based on the provided logs and the behavior presented, a thorough analysis reveals several indicators of potential malicious activity:

### 1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:

- **PowerShell Script Execution:** 
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate the execution of a command that logs into Azure and attempts to delete a user with the email ""file@yourdomain.com"". The command is encapsulated to hide its immediate intent, which can be a sign of an attacker's attempt to evade detection.
   - The command `az ad user delete --id $userprincipalname` is particularly concerning as it could remove a user account from the organizational directory, indicating potential insider threats or account takeover activities.

### 2. Elevated Privilege Operations:

- **Security Logs:**
  - Event ID 4672 indicates that the SYSTEM account was granted a series of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, among others. These elevated privileges, in combination with suspicious script execution, are indicative of potential privilege escalation tactics often used by attackers post-compromise for lateral movement or further malicious activities.

### 3. Process Execution Patterns:

- **Sysmon Logs:**
  - There's a PowerShell process tied to an unusual user account (`admin_test`) that executed a command to delete an Azure AD user, starting around the time these logs were captured. 
  - Multiple instances of conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe processes indicate attempts to interact with event logs, which might be an effort to cover the attacker's tracks by tampering with the logs.
  
### 4. Application and Process Deployments:

- **Edge Update Activities:**
  - Heavy activity involves EdgeUpdate.exe and related processes; although this could be related to regular system updates, the overlap with other suspicious activities could indicate an attempt to hide under normal update processes or even an attempted backdoor installation disguised as a legitimate update.

### Assessment:

Given the cumulative evidence of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, elevated privileges usage, and interactions indicative of log tampering, these activities align closely with tactics used during intrusion attempts. If the context does not provide an innocent explanation, this analysis deems the activities as SUSPICIOUS.

### Resolution:

Windows - wbadmin Delete systemstatebackup,"### Analysis Summary

After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, some items stand out as significant:

1. **Time Manipulation**: There is evidence of time manipulation seen in the security logs. Events with Event ID 4616 indicate that the system time was reverted to an earlier time, from ""2024-10-26 20:13:50.1441639"" to ""2024-10-26 20:13:44.5987030"". Changing the system time can be used to cover tracks or bypass timestamp-based security measures.

2. **Processes by `admin_test` user**:
   - There are several process executions by the `admin_test` user involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and execution of system state backup deletion using `cmd.exe`. The command `wbadmin delete systemstatebackup -keepVersions:0` via `cmd.exe` (Event ID: 17984) is particularly suspicious because it is deleting all system state backups which can indicate a malicious intention to remove recovery options.
   - Further, the sequence leading to `wbadmin` interaction is possibly suspicious as `wevtutil` is commonly associated with accessing and manipulating event logs, leading to concerns of tampering.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This is typical behavior for automated updates. However, there is a temporary file path noted (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU6F1B.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) indicating possibly more aggressive updating, which should be reviewed to confirm legitimacy.

4. **Security Privileges**: The `admin_test` user shows elevated privileges (Event ID: 4672) including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege`, enough to manipulate and access sensitive areas or processes.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon Event ID 5 logs indicating process terminations. It implies an abrupt or forced cessation of processes which might be used to hide presence or hinder logging.

### Assessment

- The manipulation of system time, the execution of certain commands to delete potentially crucial data backups, and the unexplained usage of high privilege accounts like `admin_test` with debugging and logging tools (`wevtutil`) suggest activities that are not aligned with typical benign practices, rather indicators of covering tracks.
  
- While the activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear typical of an automated update process, the context of executed processes around the edge and its temporary execution context warrant attention.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The logs suggest coordinated efforts potentially aimed at compromising the security integrity of the system by deleting system state backups and manipulating logs. Immediate analysis and intervention are necessary, which includes:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Conduct a full audit and analysis of the `admin_test` account to verify its activities and origin.
  - Check other related logs to see if other professional logs or recovery tools have been tampered with.
  - Compare hash values of executed executables against known database to rule out tampering.
 
- **Prevention & Detection**:
  - Introduction of stricter activity monitoring and logging of administrative activities, especially those involving time changes or direct command-line access to sensitive system areas.
  - Harden system state backup policies as well as disable direct storage manipulation unless specifically authorized.

A thorough and complete incident response and investigation should be initiated to rule out broader compromise or intent of malicious activities by unauthorized users or insiders."
Change User Password - Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest and activities require further discussion:

1. **User Account Manipulation**:
   - Multiple entries in the Security and Sysmon logs indicate the creation and manipulation of a user account named `fileAdministrator` by a user named `admin_test`. The notable entries are:
     - Security EventID 4720 (User Account Created): Indicates that the user account `fileAdministrator` was created.
     - Security EventID 4724 (Password Reset Attempt): Indicates an attempt to reset the password for `fileAdministrator`.
     - Sysmon logs reveal the command:
       ```
       ""cmd.exe"" /c net user fileAdministrator User2ChangePW! /add & net.exe user fileAdministrator HuHuHUHoHo283283@dJD
       ```
       This command simultaneously adds a new user and attempts to change the password, which is a significant indicator of suspicious activity, especially in a high-profile machine like the CEO's.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Several process executions related to Microsoft Edge Update activities might seem ordinary as they reflect typical system software updates:
     - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** and its related processes are executing various commands related to updating and service registrations. Though high in volume, these logs appear to be expected from a legitimate background update process. No evidence suggests these are linked to any malicious intent.

3. **Time and Action Correlation**:
   - The activities surrounding user account modification and high-frequency service executions might suggest an automated script or administrative changes with elevated privileges. The timing of these events coinciding with user creation could indicate an attempt to quickly establish a backdoor.

4. **Execution Environment**:
   - Execution environments with ""High"" integrity levels, like those seen in Sysmon logs, imply that the actions carried out have elevated privileges which further align with potential indicators of privilege escalation.

**Assessment and Recommendation**:

- **Assessment**: Given the sequence of events culminating in user account creation, manipulation with potential privilege escalation, the logs suggest SUSPICIOUS activity. While there are legitimate update processes ongoing, the timing and nature of user account changes necessitate careful analysis.

- **Recommendation**: Immediate action is warranted to secure the affected system. Investigate the origin and intent of the `admin_test` account. Review the creation of the `fileAdministrator` account and its necessity. Consider:
  - Isolate the machine and perform a full system audit and scan for further anomalies or ongoing compromise.
  - Identify any scripts or processes that may have executed the observed commands.
  - Cross-reference with organizational policies on user management and account privileges.
  - Change passwords and review access logs for any further anomalies.

Based on the provided information, the overall resolution is SUSPICIOUS. Further investigation will ensure the security posture of the CEO's machine remains uncompromised."
PureLocker Ransom Note,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, I have made the following observations and assessments:

### Analysis and Observations

**1. Process Execution:**
   - The logs indicate multiple executions of commonly trusted system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`) and processes related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`).
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to create a Purelocker ransom note is highly concerning:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c echo data - Purelocker Ransom Note > %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\YOUR_FILES.txt` indicates potential ransomware or deceptive activity.

**2. Command-line Arguments:**
   - The command-line arguments used with `cmd.exe` further emphasize potential malicious activity, as they appear to mimic actions seen in ransomware attacks.

**3. Privilege Level:**
   - Many processes, particularly those associated with Edge updates and system utilities, run with high integrity or system integrity levels, suggesting potential for privilege escalation or misuse.

**4. Regular Updates vs. Anomalous Behavior:**
   - While many of the logs displaying Edge update activities can be attributed to regular software updates, the execution syntax in the `cmd.exe` log hint at an anomaly that aligns with malicious behavior patterns.

**5. Use of System Services:**
   - `svchost.exe` actions regarding time synchronization and system services appear normal, relating to standard operations.

### Assessment

Based on the provided logs, there is a clear indication that a potentially malicious action was executed on the Windows host, specifically involving the `cmd.exe` process targeting user documents for creating a potentially fake ransomware note. This is a strong indicator of deceptive or trial-level malicious attempt related to ransomware activities, rather than benign software update operations.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Ransomware Risk:** The creation of a ransomware note indicates at least a superficial attempt at ransomware deployment, which could be a test run or part of a broader attack strategy.
- **Deceptive Operation:** Usage of legitimate system processes to mimic or mask malicious intent.

### Recommended Actions to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any potential spread of malware or unauthorized network communication.
2. **In-depth Malware Scan:** Perform a thorough malware sweep of the system using updated antivirus/antimalware tools.
3. **Review and Audit:** Check other systems for similar patterns/logs and ensure they're not compromised.
4. **Log Further Activity:** Enable detailed logging, especially for processes and network activities, to track any anomalous behavior.
5. **User Education:** Reinforce awareness and training on ransomware protection and deception techniques.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate malicious activity consistent with ransomware behavior and should be treated with high priority for immediate investigation and remediation actions."
Windows - Overwrite file with SysInternals SDelete,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Overview:
The provided logs span multiple categories, including Security, Application, PowerShell, and Sysmon logs. Our analysis will focus on identifying any signs of malicious activity by looking for unusual processes, unexpected command-line arguments, and any behavior indicative of privilege escalation or lateral movement.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Security Logs**:
   - **EventID 4798**: Several events indicating attempts to pass through accounts such as ""Administrator,"" ""admin_test,"" ""DefaultAccount,"" ""Guest,"" and ""lplui"" using `taskhostw.exe`. This series of attempts is frequent and highly concentrated within a short timeframe which suggests automated activity likely aimed at enumeration or access validation.
   - **EventIDs 4624 and 4672**: LogonType 5 indicating a service account logon implies system processes corresponding to normal operations, but it’s crucial to check for any privileged escalations resulting from these logins.
   - **EventID 5379**: Shows failed credential retrieval attempts related to a Microsoft account `user=02txoixylodcstop`. This could indicate an attempt at unauthorized access or credential misuse.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - Several entries related to the execution of PowerShell scripts that reference paths like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\script\script.exe`. Sensitive operations performed by PowerShell, especially creating or manipulating files in Temp directories, is often characteristic of exploit kits or preparatory steps in malware deployment.
  
3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Processes like `powershell.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `script.exe` involved and triggered by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of `Sysinternals script` for secure file delete (`script.exe` -accepteula command) can indicate attempts to cover tracks or erase evidence.
   - The observation of frequent Sysmon EventID 1 (process creation) involving different system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`) indicates potential attempts to gather system information or manipulate local system configurations.

4. **Other Indicators**:
   - A `Microsoft Edge Update` process sequence showing updates being applied. Most entries under this show log activities related to Microsoft Edge, which seems usual. But seeing if these processes were tampered should be part of the detailed check.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Common Themes**: The combination of frequent PowerShell usage, Sysmon logging entries indicating deleted files, and account-based attempts point towards signs of possible preparatory steps for a larger attack or an active attempt to compromise this host.
  
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
  - Unauthorized account enumeration through `taskhostw.exe` hints towards reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.
  - Usage of PowerShell to run scripts related to potential evasion or lateral movement.
  - Actions observed via Sysmon indicate potential attempts to perform actions requiring elevated privilege or to cover tracks (file deletion).

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The nature of activity, including the unauthorized account enumeration, credential retrieval attempts, creation and deletion of potentially sensitive files, and the use of utilities like PowerShell and Sysinternals, indicates this might be part of an unauthorized or malicious operation on the system. There is a strong likelihood that these are preparatory or evasive actions for a cyber attack.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
  
2. **Detailed Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the Server002 to determine the entry point and scope of the breach.
   - Analyze related logs from neighboring systems for signs of lateral movement.

3. **Credential Review**:
   - Verify all user accounts mentioned, particularly `admin_test`, for unauthorized access or changes occurred post-incident.
   - Reset credentials for accounts observed to be targeted or used in the logs.

4. **Apply Patching**:
   - Ensure all software including the OS and particularly those involving seen processes like EdgeUpdate are up-to-date with security patches.

5. **Improve Defensive Measures**:
   - Increase the logging and monitoring levels on PowerShell and critical system activities to prevent similar future activities.
   - Consider deploying enhanced endpoint detection solutions with behavioral analysis capabilities.

6. **Inform Stakeholders**:
   - Notify relevant stakeholders and possibly law enforcement if data breaches are confirmed.

Implement these steps to align immediate recovery and ongoing monitoring strategy to mitigate risks."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon and application logs, several activities and behaviors have been identified that raise concerns about potential malicious activity on the Windows host, specifically Server002. Here's a detailed analysis of suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Usage of `vssadmin.exe`:**
   - There are multiple entries for `vssadmin.exe` being executed. Initially, it's run to list shadow copies, and later, it's used to delete all shadow copies quietly (`vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet`). This behavior aligns with known tactics used by ransomware to delete shadow copies, thus preventing recovery of files without paying a ransom. The command `vssadmin.exe delete shadows /all /quiet` is particularly worrisome, as it deletes all volume shadow copies without notification, a common tactic to inhibit data recovery.

2. **Command-line Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
   - `cmd.exe` executed `vssadmin.exe` with the delete shadows command. The use of command-line to execute such a specific operation adds an element of suspicion, especially under a high integrity level.

3. **Execution of Utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The invocation of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may be part of a script to harvest system information or in preparation for further actions. While not inherently malicious, when combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a larger malicious operation.

4. **Frequent Launch of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple entries show `conhost.exe` processes being spawned, often associated with command-line utilities. While `conhost.exe` can be a legitimate part of command prompt operations, its repeated launch, especially without much context, could indicate scripting or automated tasks being run in the background.

5. **Processes Executed by Unusual Parent Applications:**
   - Processes such as `vssadmin.exe` and `whoami.exe` are children of `wsmprovhost.exe`. This might indicate remote command execution through Windows Remote Management (WinRM), which can be leveraged for legitimate management or for lateral movement and execution of scripts by an attacker.

### Evaluation and Conclusion:

- **Threat Identification:**
  - The deletion of shadow copies using `vssadmin.exe` without obvious justification and at a high integrity level is a strong indicator of potential ransomware behavior.
  - The combination of shadow copy manipulation, system reconnaissance commands (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`), and potential remote script execution align with typical malicious behavior patterns.

### Resolution:

Given the activities involving `vssadmin.exe` and the scripting-like pattern of process executions, along with the potential for shadow copy deletion to negate data recovery, I conclude that the logs contain indicators of malicious activity.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** 

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or execution of malicious operations.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise, focusing on command history, additional logs, and potential persistence mechanisms.
   
2. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Use backup images, if available and unaffected, to restore critical data after ensuring the environment is secure.
   - Review and potentially change all passwords to prevent any unauthorized access.

3. **Future Prevention:**
   - Implement application whitelisting to block unauthorized use of utilities like `vssadmin.exe`.
   - Strengthen EDR rules to detect and alert on behaviors such as shadow copy deletion and unusual script executions.
   - Conduct regular security audits and training to increase awareness of such attack vectors."
Logoff System - Windows,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities can be observed. Let's break down these entries:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped which is not inherently suspicious as it could be related to scheduled updates or maintenance.
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` event indicates normal operation concerning software protection.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, `wevtutil` is used for event log management and thus should be monitored. However, there's no indication of malicious activity solely based on its presence.
   - The `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` processes were executed. The command **`cmd.exe /c shutdown /l`** is noteworthy because it issues a logout/shutdown command which, depending on the context, can be either misused by an insider or part of standard operations like maintenance or policy enforcement.
   - A, series of Edge Update activities executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` do not seem out of the ordinary considering they mention updating processes; this matches expected software behavior for updates.
   - The `shutdown.exe` commands also appear; these could be part of either scripting/automation tasks or administration activities.

**Anomalous/Suspicious Behavior:**
- The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could be non-standard for routine user activity. However, given no other correlating malicious indicators and knowing `admin_test` might be an account used for system administration, this could represent legitimate use.
- More importantly, the `shutdown.exe` operations being executed, potentially paired with `cmd.exe` commands to log users off, might warrant a closer look if there are no scheduled tasks or maintenance windows articulated.

**Assessment:**
- **Indicators of Compromise/Threat Risks:**
  - No clear malware indicators or highly suspicious command-line arguments were detected.
  - The potential for misuse given `cmd.exe` and `shutdown` operations, though potentially benign, require validation against usual system management or scheduled tasks.

**Resolution:**
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The log activities appear typical, but the `shutdown.exe` and `cmd.exe` invocations are unusual enough to warrant further inquiry, especially if these do not align with authorized maintenance or administrative activities. Verify if these actions were scheduled or authorized by system administrators or as part of routine maintenance. If unauthorized or unexpected, this may need deeper security review or user engagement for clarity.

**Guidance to Proceed:**
1. Verify with system administrators if there were planned operations or scripts occasionally using `cmd.exe` for shutdown commands.
2. Review task scheduler and group policy for automated commands or scripts.
3. Cross-reference user `admin_test` activities with user logs or session recordings, if available, to confirm if these were initiated intentionally or if any anomalies occurred with this account.
4. Ensure no unauthorized access patterns pertain to modifications of update mechanisms.

This cautious approach will help confirm whether or not these operations stand as legitimate versus potential policy violations or insider threats."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure AD PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided logs, we can make several observations about the behavior occurring on Server002:

### Suspicious Behavior
1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs show commands that include `Connect-AzureAD` and `Remove-AzureADUser` which are being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These commands involve connecting to an Azure Active Directory and attempting to remove a user, which is certainly suspicious, especially without clear context or approval.

2. **Process Executions**: The Sysmon logs show numerous instances of command-line executions with PowerShell, `wevtutil`, and other processes that warrant further inspection. For example, the PowerShell execution, combined with `whoami` and attempts to manipulate event logs using `wevtutil`, can be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity.

3. **Privileges and Accounts**: Security EventID 4672 logs indicate the assignment of numerous high-level privileges to the SYSTEM account, which is a typical behavior, but in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity, this warrants closer examination.

4. **Credential Events**: There are numerous EventID 5379 logs related to credential access failing, which could suggest attempts at unauthorized access or manipulation of credentials.

### Assessment
The behavior observed is indicative of potentially unauthorized administrative actions, specifically focusing on Azure AD manipulation using PowerShell. The combination of elevated privilege logons, the use of `Remove-AzureADUser`, and event log management activities align with potential post-exploitation activities commonly seen in compromised environments. Moreover, the sequence and timing across the different channels raise red flags regarding intentions and motivations of the executed actions without visible prior authorization or task documentation.

### Conclusion
Given these findings, we resolve the situation as **MALICIOUS**. The activity shown in the logs reflects unauthorized and potentially harmful operations with probable intent to manipulate directory services, indicating a potential security compromise.

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Containment**: Restrict any further PowerShell access and disable the `admin_test` account pending further investigation.
2. **Review Authorization**: Verify whether these operations were authorized and identify the source or intent behind the PowerShell scripts.
3. **Comprehensive Audit**: Conduct a detailed audit of recent changes in Azure AD and review any modifications or deletions of users in the directory.
4. **Increased Monitoring**: Enhance logging and monitoring, especially around PowerShell and high-privilege accounts to detect any further anomalies.
5. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to analyze potential lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts and ensure the environment's integrity.

This assessment suggests the need for urgency to mitigate potential security breaches and secure critical assets within the organization."
Windows - Stop service using net.exe,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, several aspects within the logs suggest potentially malicious behavior that warrants deeper investigation:

1. **Command Line Activity**: 
   - There are multiple occurrences of processes interacting with `wevtutil.exe`, known for its use in clearing event logs. Such actions often attempt to cover tracks during malicious activity. 
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `net.exe stop spooler` is suspicious. Stopping the spooler service might be an attempted attack vector or part of a malicious operation aiming to exploit print spool vulnerabilities or disrupt normal operations.

2. **Unusual Privilege Use**: 
   - The `admin_test` user is seen repeatedly executing commands with high integrity levels and administrative privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, etc.). This user appears to be involved in executing the aforementioned suspicious commands.

3. **Process and Log Activity**:
   - Significant Sysmon log activities involve the `admin_test` user, further linked to suspicious process executions such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and a `hostname.exe` execution, which do not seem necessary for typical administrative tasks in this context or timeframe.
   - Anomalies in time synchronization (Event ID: 4616 in Security Logs) detected through svchost.exe potentially denote network-based time alterations, possibly to mask or time-shift logged activities related to malicious operations.

4. **Network and Logon Behavior**:
   - There is a remote logon (Logon Type 3) with NTLM authentication from a workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This could suggest lateral movement or unauthorized remote access attempts, a common tactic among threat actors once access within a network is achieved.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
Taken together, these logs suggest a series of actions that may have been orchestrated to obfuscate and carry out potentially malicious activities on server `Server002`, primarily facilitated by the user `admin_test`. These events indicate potential compromise rather than purely benign or typical administrative activity. However, there are no definitive malicious payloads identified; rather, the actions are very closely associated with techniques often used in attacks.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Initiate a deeper forensic analysis to confirm any unauthorized modifications or data access.
- Review network logs and firewall settings for further indications of suspicious behavior.
- Directly audit the 'admin_test' account, investigating any deviations in recent activity patterns or logins.
- Isolate the affected system if direct malicious activity confirmation occurs to prevent lateral movement.
- Strengthen monitoring around service management operations (`net.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) and implement stricter controls over administrative account usage.
- Consider conducting a security awareness session focused on remote access and privilege abuse, highlighting signs of compromise prevention."
