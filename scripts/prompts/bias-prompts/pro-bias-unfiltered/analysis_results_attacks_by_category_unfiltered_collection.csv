ESXi - Remove Syslog remote,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, several indicators of potentially suspicious activities were identified:

1. **Log Deletions**: There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command being used to clear key event logs, including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. For instance:
   - System log records indicating log clearing (EventID 104) by the `admin_test` user at timestamps such as `08:01:52.412` and `08:01:52.679`.
   - Security log (EventID 1102) showing log file cleared by `admin_test` at `08:01:52.552`.

2. **PowerShell Scripts**: 
   - A PowerShell script execution is noticed with suspicious content involving network operations to extract and manipulate IP addresses. This script is utilizing `plink.exe`, which is a tool for command-line networking operations, while targeting a remote host `atomic.local`. This kind of activity is often linked to malicious attempts to remotely manipulate or configure network devices.
   - PowerShell execution appearing with commands that seem to orchestrate some automated task activity, potentially linking to adversarial simulation tools.

3. **Unusual User Activity**: 
   - The `admin_test` user is actively involved in the activities mentioned above, including deleting logs and running scripts from non-standard paths such as `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam`.

4. **Sysmon Events**:
   - Numerous Sysmon events showing processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `conhost.exe` being repeatedly invoked, indicative of command-line or script-driven tasks.

These findings collectively suggest that an attempted or ongoing compromise may be occurring on the host machine. The clearing of logs is a well-known technique used by adversaries to cover their tracks, and the command-line PowerShell operations involving network tool execution further build a case for suspicious activity.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While the logs do not provide absolute evidence of malicious intent due to the lack of specific attack signatures or external alerts correlating the activity, the combination of log deletions, PowerShell use, and network tool operations require immediate attention and further investigation. Steps should include:

- Isolating the system from the network for further forensic analysis.
- Conducting an in-depth review of recent system changes, installed software, and any persistence mechanisms.
- Configuring alerts for similar activities across other critical systems and potentially using external threat intelligence to broaden the investigation scope."
Compress Data for Exfiltration With PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis

After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - The security event log (Event ID 1102) and system log (Event ID 104) show that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" This activity is significant because clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to erase their tracks and hinder investigations.
   - Specifically, execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear the logs is evident from the Sysmon log entries, notably using the command `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. These actions are typically associated with illicit activity.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Command Execution:**
   - There were events indicating a successful logon (Event ID 4624) and special privileges assigned (Event ID 4672) to the SYSTEM account. This could be legitimate in certain contexts but suspicious if not expected, especially in coordination with other observed anomalies.
   - A PowerShell command was executed by ""admin_test"" to recursively compress and archive user profile data (`Compress-Archive`). This behavior corresponds with Tactic ID T1560 (Archive Collected Data), often seen in data exfiltration scenarios.

3. **Multiple Credential Access Failures:**
   - Event ID 5379 shows repeated failures in accessing credential-related information. Although the return codes (3221226021) might indicate some misconfiguration or access denial by legitimate services, consistent with other findings, it can sometimes imply an attempt to access sensitive credentials.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a script was run to compress data from the user's profile folder. It seems part of a potentially malicious tactic to gather and possibly exfiltrate data.
   - Sequence of PowerShell events shows the loading of System.IO.Compression.FileSystem, which further aligns with data compression activities.

2. **Usage of SYSTEM Privileges:**
   - SYSTEM account activities are expected for system-level processes. However, in this context, the privilege escalation paired with the logs being cleared is highly concerning.

3. **Network and Update Activity:**
   - Substantial update-related activities targeting Microsoft Edge hint at potential software updates. However, without additional context or an anomaly, they appear benign in isolation.

### Assessment

- **Threats or Risks Identified:**
  - The clearing of event logs by ""admin_test,"" coupled with the execution of PowerShell scripts for data compression, presents a high risk of insider threat or credential compromise.
  - The behavior observed is consistent with patterns commonly associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) or data exfiltration by attackers.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Verify the Intentions of Admin Actions:**
  - Contact ""admin_test"" and verify if the log clearance and PowerShell script execution were legitimate administrative tasks.
  
- **Isolate and Investigate:**
  - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration.
  - Examine the recent administrative changes and user account activities on the server.

- **Increase Monitoring and Alerting:**
  - Increase monitoring of privileged accounts, especially focusing on log clearance, process execution involving `wevtutil.exe`, and unauthorized PowerShell commands.

- **Strengthen Security Measures:**
  - Implement security controls to prevent unauthorized log clearance, such as monitoring for specific audit events or restricting certain admin actions.
  - Ensure all accounts with high privileges use multi-factor authentication (MFA).

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The combination of log file clearing, PowerShell usage for archiving data, and elevated privileges usage are strong indicators of malicious activity. Immediate actions should be taken to contain and investigate further."
Recon information for export with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - In the System and Security logs, there are multiple entries (EventID 104) indicating that log files were cleared by the user `admin_test`:
     - System channel: `EventRecordID 3566`
     - Windows PowerShell channel: `EventRecordID 3567`
     - Security channel: `EventRecordID 30357`
   - Clearing log files, especially without a proper justification or alerting, can potentially be a sign of malicious activity or an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or unintended actions.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs capture PowerShell executing a command that collects various system data such as services, environment variables, and processes, storing them in the TEMP directory. This is seen in:
     - `ProcessId 2852` executing PowerShell with command collecting data into files: `$env:TEMP\\T1119_1.txt`, `$env:TEMP\\T1119_2.txt`, `$env:TEMP\\T1119_3.txt`

3. **Wevtutil Command Use:**
   - The Sysmon logs show `wevtutil.exe` being utilized by `admin_test` to clear event logs which is indicated by multiple entries in the Sysmon log related to `wevtutil.exe`. This process cleared:
     - Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational logs
     - Application
     - Windows PowerShell

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` performing update operations:
     - Typically benign, this constant Edge update activity could suggest automatic updates, but should be reviewed to ensure all updates are trusted and expected.


#### Assessment of Malicious Activity

The combination of log clearance activities, usage of PowerShell for data collection without evident justification, and the use of native tools that can be leveraged for malicious intent (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`), highlight suspicious behavior. Specific use of wevtutil to clear logs and PowerShell for system data gathering, are common tactics in the MITRE ATT&CK framework for defense evasion and discovery, respectively.

### Identified Threats or Risks

- **Potential Compromise:** The actions taken may signify an attempt to evade detection and gather system information possibly for privilege escalation or lateral movement.
- **Risk of Unauthorized Data Access:** If an unauthorized user is involved, collected data about services and processes may help in further compromise efforts.

### Guidance on how to Proceed

1. Investigate the User `admin_test`: Determine whether the actions performed were legitimate, whether they align with this user’s usual behavior patterns, or if the account has potentially been compromised.
2. Forensic Analysis: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis involving examining the context around the usage of PowerShell and the reasons for log clearance to ascertain whether it was part of a malicious script or authorized activity.
3. Enhance Monitoring: Elevate the logging and monitoring level, especially around PowerShell and system administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`.
4. Incident Response: If unauthorized actions are confirmed, proceed with incident response protocols which may include shutting down aspects of the network or removing/suspending the user account until further information is obtained.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

The activities within the logs suggest anomalies that warrant further investigation to confirm or rule out malicious intent. The log clearing, especially in combination with other questionable activities, should be explicitly justified by legitimate team members or further action should be taken."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with 7zip,"Analyzing the provided logs reveals several key observations and potential indicators of compromise:

1. **Processes and Command Lines**:
   - The use of `cmd.exe` with unusual command lines, such as creating files and directories in a temp location specifically associated with `AtomicRedTeam\T1560.001\victim-files` and then invoking `7-zip` to compress files using a password (`-pblue`), suggests potential simulation or execution of a common attack technique. Atomic Red Team tests are known for autonomous, benign exploitation tests that replicate malicious behavior.
   - Commands involving `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, and excessive system commands (`whoami`, `hostname`) executed in quick succession by the same user are clear indicators of either a red team exercise or a potential compromise.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Observation of elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, et cetera) in Event ID 4672 is common in legitimate admin actions but can be leveraged during malicious activity, especially when seen in conjunction with log clearing.

3. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Specific logs indicate the clearing of Security, System, Application, and PowerShell event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl [Channel]`). Log clearing is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities.
   - `Event ID 1102` in the Security log for log clearance corroborates this activity.

4. **Quick Succession and Time Synchronization**:
   - Numerous activities performed in quick succession could point toward automated scripting, which is often user-for-obfuscation and rapid execution in attacks or during red team exercises.

5. **Potential Red Team Activity**:
   - The presence of the term `AtomicRedTeam` in the command line arguments strongly indicates a controlled simulation exercise or security testing. Thus, the nature of some of these actions aligns more with penetration testing or security training operations than with real-world attack scenarios.

### Assessment & Conclusion:
Based on the above observations:
- The use of controlled atomic tests is evident, suggesting these actions are conducted either for internal training or simulation purposes rather than genuine malicious behavior.
- However, without additional context of intentional initiated exercises, such actions could be confused with unauthorized access or malicious attempts, especially given the record clearing actions.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: Although the `AtomicRedTeam` presence suggests planned simulations, the potential risk that this represents unauthorized testing or simulations without proper authorization and tracking, or even abused red team tools, necessitates further investigation. Confirmation of a legitimate security exercise is required.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Verify with the IT or Security department if a red team exercise was conducted at the specified time.
- Cross-reference these logs with known schedules for security testing.
- If no exercise occurred, perform a thorough investigation to identify the source and purpose of these actions and monitor for further abnormal behaviors or unauthorized clearance of logs.
"
Utilize Clipboard to store or execute commands from,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations and potential concerns were identified:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The logs show repeated execution of the `wevtutil.exe` command with parameters to clear event logs for several channels, including ""System,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell."" This is notably suspicious because log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the Windows Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - System Event ID 104 also confirms the clearing of system logs by the same user.
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` process, typically involved in Windows Remote Management (WinRM), appears to be a parent process indicating potential remote execution or automation involved in these actions.

3. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Security Event ID 4616 shows time discrepancy manipulations, indicated by changes in system time detected in the `svchost.exe` process, likely to disrupt event timeline tracking.
   - System Event IDs related to time changes further affirm the attempts to manipulate the system time.

4. **Command Execution:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed with unusual commands including clipboard manipulation indicating suspicious usage patterns often associated with data exfiltration or command obfuscation.

5. **Enumerator Programs Execution:**
   - Legitimate programs such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe` are executed, which could simply reflect normal administrative activities or information gathering phases of an attack.

6. **Usage of `clip.exe`:**
   - `clip.exe` was executed, which is often used for clipboard operations and coupled with the `cmd.exe` manipulation suggests a potential attempt to streamline data processing or exfiltration activities.

**Assessment of Situation:**
Based on the evidence of systematic clearing of logs, unusual command-line activity, and potential attempts to obfuscate and manipulate system reporting, these activities align with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with malicious actors aiming to hide their tracks after unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Potential unauthorized access to the system with high-level clearance attempts made to cover tracks.
- Evidence suggests malicious intent, likely involving remote execution or scripting aimed at evading detection.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Incident Response Activation:** Engage the incident response team to contain and monitor the affected system immediately.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Preserve all relevant logs and take a forensic image of the system to analyze further any undetected malicious artifacts or scripts.
3. **Remove Unauthorized Access:** Change all potentially compromised credentials, specifically targeting the `admin_test` account.
4. **Infrastructure Audit:** Verify security policies regarding remote management and log access permissions to identify potential vulnerabilities.
5. **Security Enhancements:** Strengthen monitoring, configure logging to a centralized secure location, and update security policies to prevent similar breaches in the future.
6. **Report:** Document and report findings to stakeholders and consider reporting to your cyber threat information sharing network.

Given the criticality of the account and the nature of these activities, timely action is crucial to mitigate potential data breaches or further system compromises."
Execute Commands from Clipboard using PowerShell,"Based on the provided logs, here is the analysis of the activity noted across various log types:

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The logs show PowerShell commands being executed using an obfuscation technique, with the command `{echo Get-Process | clip; Get-Clipboard | iex}`. This indicates a potential object from the clipboard is being executed without direct invocation, which is a common tactic for evading detection and running code. Such activity can be highly suspicious, especially if performed by a non-administrative user or process that typically does not execute these kinds of commands.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are numerous `wevtutil.exe` command executions found in the logs, specifically targeting event logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. The tool `wevtutil` is used to read and manage event logs, but excessive or unusual access may indicate an attempt to cover tracks by viewing or clearing logs.
   - The process associated with these commands is `admin_test`, suggesting a user account is being used to issue these commands.
   - A `Security` log clear is observed, which is a critical indicator of log tampering or record evading activity. The fact that specific logs are being cleared shortly after suspicious PowerShell activities strongly suggests an attempt to hide evidence of malicious actions.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - EventID 1102 (Audit Log Cleared) was triggered, showing that the Security log was specifically cleared by the user `admin_test` at `2024-10-24 21:17:19.9884051`. This is a high-privilege operation and often an indicator of malicious activity when combined with other suspicious actions.

4. **System Logs:**
   - Log clear events corroborate with Sysmon and Security log details, continuing the theme of logs being manipulated or removed.

5. **Potential Account Compromise:**
   - Repeated occurrences of `whoami.exe` and `clip.exe` processes appear to be linked with data gathering or identification commands that don't typically run without specific purpose. When linked with command obfuscation tactics mentioned earlier, these are indicative of reconnaissance or preparation for subsequent malicious actions.

**Assessment:**
- The presence of PowerShell commands aimed at clipboard execution, coupled with the clearing of various critical logs (`Security`, `System`, etc.) without a legitimate reason, forms a strong case for probable malicious activities. The user's actions who executed these events, `admin_test`, are in line with what one might expect from an unauthorized or malicious actor attempting to glean system information and cover tracks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the host (`Server002`) to prevent further malicious actions or potential spreading.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to discern the full scope of compromise and any possible data exfiltration.
- Review and contain the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access. This may include resetting credentials, reviewing other accesses, and disabling the account until secured.
- Analyze network logs for any unusual outbound or lateral movements initiated from this host.
- Implement or verify advanced security measures (e.g., PowerShell script block logging, Sysmon configurations) to detect and alert on similar behaviors in the future."
Office365 - Remote Mail Collected,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious and malicious activities have been observed:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs reveal PowerShell script execution, capturing tokens from Azure and interacting with Microsoft Graph API. The script is designed to:
     - Connect to Azure using a PSCredential object, potentially indicating automated or headless access.
     - Generate and use a self-signed certificate, which could be leveraged for persistent access.
     - Create a service principal and assign roles within Microsoft Graph, particularly focusing on the Mail.Read permission. This aligns with the T1114.002 technique (Office365 - Remote Email Collection) from the MITRE ATT&CK framework, indicating an attempt to collect emails from specified users/mailboxes.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple logs from the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared during the timeframe of the provided entries. This activity is typically performed to cover tracks after or during a compromise.

3. **Inconsistent Processes and Parent-Child Relations:**
   - The Sysmon logs show use of `wevtutil.exe` on multiple occasions to clear event logs, which is consistent with efforts to tamper with logs to hinder forensic analysis.
   - Frequent use of `conhost.exe` as a child process to various system utilities which is a typical indicator that commands are being executed in the background, likely as part of more complex operations.

4. **Privilege Levels and User Activity:**
   - All suspicious PowerShell and process activities are executed with high integrity levels under the user ""admin_test,"" a potentially powerful account on the system (as indicated by the logon ID and consistency across activities).
   - Use of system utilities with high privileges to execute potentially malicious activities and clear logs.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
Given the nature of the actions observed in the logs:
- Use of PowerShell scripts to extract sensitive information using Microsoft Graph API.
- Clearing of significant event logs indicating possible concealment attempts.
These activities are classic indicators of malicious intent, specifically aimed at information theft or reconnaissance.

   - Deploy endpoint protection and configure alerts for suspicious script executions and privilege changes.
   - Educate users, especially privileged accounts, on secure authentication and access management practices."
Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with winzip,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities raise concerns of potential malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Log entries show multiple instances of cleared event logs:
     - System log cleared by user `admin_test` at `2024-10-28 07:53:22`.
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared by the same user immediately after.
     - Security event log cleared at `2024-10-28 07:53:22.9778096`.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs is suspicious, as it can be part of a tactics to erase tracks post-compromise.

2. **Unusual Command-Line Behavior**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with a command line to check for the existence of a `winzip64.exe` with conditions to run certain commands based on its presence. The command was executed from PowerShell, which can imply obfuscation attempts.
   - Another `cmd.exe` process shows a command that attempts to modify the PATH environment variable, create directories, and use WinZip with a password to create an encrypted archive. The presence of “This file will be encrypted” in the commands further suggests attempts to encrypt sensitive data, often linked with ransomware actions.

3. **Privilege Use**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and other command executions are running under a high-integrity level and by a user `admin_test`, hinting at privilege use possibly outside typical administrative tasks.

### Indicators of Compromise:
The indicators noted above are often seen in a compromised environment:
- Clearing of event logs, particularly security logs, is a method attackers use to hide their activities.
- The creation of an encrypted archive with a specific password, alongside log clearing, strongly points towards preparation for data exfiltration, commonly associated with ransomware attacks.

### Assessment:
The combination of event log clearing and activities around data encryption suggests malicious intent. These behaviors are clear indicators of compromise.

### Resolution:
Based on the analysis, the logs contain activities clearly indicative of **MALICIOUS** intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Measures**: Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further actions by the attacker.
- **Investigation**: Further investigation into the origin of these actions, such as how the `admin_test` account was potentially compromised.
- **Audit and Monitoring**: Review other systems for similar patterns and strengthen event logging to detect and respond to similar activities promptly.
- **Incident Response**: Engage incident response to analyze and mitigate any potential data leaks and ensure that the threat is comprehensively removed from the environment."
Search files of interest and save them to a single zip file (Windows),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing (Event ID 1102 & 104)**:
   - There are events indicating that security logs and other system logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Log file clearance is a common tactic used by attackers to erase their tracks on a system. This action is suspicious, especially since it was performed by a user account with administrative privileges shortly before or after the execution of other anomalous activities.

2. **Unauthorized Privilege Escalation (Event ID 4672)**:
   - Elevated privileges were granted to the SYSTEM account, including sensitive rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are often abused by attackers to maintain persistence, perform privilege escalation, or execute sensitive operations.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script executed by ""powershell.exe"" under ""admin_test"" user seems to perform reconnaissance and data collection activities. The script is designed to search for files with specific extensions (.doc, .docx, .txt), compress them, and store them in a temporary directory. This behavior matches known tactics used by attackers to exfiltrate data.

4. **Execution of Event Log Utility (wevtutil.exe)**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility was executed multiple times under ""admin_test"" to clear different event logs such as ""Security"", ""Application"", and ""System"". Similar to clearing logs via Event IDs 1102 and 104, this activity is suspicious and aligns with tactics to disrupt forensic analysis by removing traces of misconduct.

5. **Process Execution by SYSTEM Account**:
   - Processes running as ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" such as ""TrustedInstaller"", ""WmiPrvSE"", among others are legitimate but should be assured that they have not been exploited. The execution timings closely following or leading the suspicious activities should be scrutinized to ensure there was no foul play in manipulating these processes.

6. **Time Sync Events**:
   - Multiple time change events were logged within a short period which could indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps for log tampering or to mislead timestamp-based security tools.

Given these findings, there are significant signs pointing towards potentially malicious activity. Clearing of logs, specific file searches, and elevation of privileges are notable red flags. 

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or damage.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the machine, focusing on recently executed commands, scheduled tasks, and persistence methods.
- Review the activities of the ""admin_test"" account and determine if it has been compromised. If so, disable the account and perform a password reset on all other accounts with similar permissions.
- Audit other systems for similar suspicious activities.
- Based on findings, refine security policies and incident detection capabilities to prevent future occurrences."
Registry artefact when application use microphone,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

Upon reviewing the Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs, several activities stand out that require attention:

1. **Use of `cmd.exe` to Alter Registry (EventID: 18003)**
   - The command `reg add` within a `cmd.exe` process is used to edit the Windows Registry. This action modifies microphone access time settings under the `CapabilityAccessManager`. Such registry manipulations, especially related to capabilities like microphone access, can indicate an attempt to cover tracks or alter system behavior for persistent access, which is unusual and suspicious for regular user activities.
   - The command being executed through `cmd.exe` is suspicious due to its nature and could indicate malware attempting to manipulate the system's configuration.

2. **Clearing of Security Event Log (EventID: 1102)**
   - The log contains an event for the Security log being cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing security logs is a classic indicator of malicious intent, aimed at removing traces of unauthorized activities or investigations.

3. **Time Manipulation (EventID: 4616)**
   - A change in system time by a system process (`svchost.exe`) was logged. This behavior, combined with log clearing, can signify attempts to hide tracks or create time discrepancies to confuse log investigation.

4. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Events Multiple)**
   - The repeated invocation of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs such as the System and PowerShell logs further underscores attempts to hide activity on the system.

5. **Execution of Discovery Commands (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`)**
   - The execution of simple commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might themselves not be directly malicious but can be part of a reconnaissance process within a compromised system.

**Assessment:**
The logs display several indicators of potentially malicious activity: registry manipulation through `cmd.exe`, log clearing with `wevtutil.exe`, and time discrepancies. The combination of these actions strongly suggests that an unauthorized or malicious actor is attempting to cover tracks within the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Based on the patterns observed in the logs, it's highly likely these activities are malicious. Immediate incident response actions should be taken to contain and remediate the system. This includes:

- Isolating the machine from the network to prevent further potential harm.
- Conducting a thorough forensic investigation to confirm the scope and nature of the compromise.
- Reviewing user credentials associated with `admin_test` to determine if they have been compromised.
- Restoring event logs where possible and implementing more stringent monitoring to detect any further malicious actions promptly."
Recon information for export with Command Prompt,"The analysis of the provided logs reveals several indicators of potential malicious activity. Let’s break down the findings:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Event ID 1102** and Event ID 104 indicate that the Windows Security log and the system log were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". Clearing event logs is often associated with attackers trying to hide their malicious activity, making this an immediate red flag.

2. **Event Log Manipulation using Wevtutil:**
   - There are multiple entries showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with arguments to clear logs such as `cl Security`, `cl Application`, and others. This process was executed by the ""admin_test"" account with high integrity levels, indicating it had significant privileges on the system.

3. **Recurring Pattern of Wevtutil and Conhost Executions:**
   - **Processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` repeatedly executed**. While these are legitimate processes, their frequent execution, especially tied to event log manipulation operations, adds to the suspicion of an attempt to cover tracks.

4. **Command Line Execution:**
   - **Execution of commands via `cmd.exe`:** There’s an execution of the command line by the user ""admin_test"" issuing commands such as:
     - **`sc query type=service`**, **`doskey /history`**, **`wmic process list`**, and **`tree C:\\AtomicRedTeam\\atomics`**.
     - These commands are usually part of enumeration activities, potentially tied to intelligence gathering about the system.

5. **Atomic Red Team references:**
   - The presence of the ""Atomic Red Team"" directory and related actions (seen in paths and execution arguments) is noteworthy. Atomic Red Team is a testing suite used by red teams to simulate adversary tactics. While not inherently malicious, seeing such tools on non-research machines without explicit justification can be suspicious.

### Assessment:

1. **Malicious Intent:** The logs showing event log clearing, combined with the execution of commands to potentially enumerate services and process lists with the use of tools commonly associated with advanced persistent threats (such as Atomic Red Team), strongly indicate malicious activity.

2. **Potential Threats and Risks:**
   - Unauthorized clearing of logs can indicate compromise, as well as the fact that potentially harmful commands were run to gather system information.
   - The implication is that a malicious actor attempted to hide traces of activity while collecting information on the system.

### Recommendations:

1. **Resolution:**
   - Based on the analysis, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**. The combination of actions observed in the logs fits typical patterns of compromise and should be treated with urgency.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the ""SERVER002"" system to determine the extent of the compromise.
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent any further unauthorized access or spread within the network.
   - Review the system and network configurations, especially focusing on access logs and any unusual changes or access patterns.

3. **Further Steps:**
   - Ensure that all sensitive data accessed by the affected user is reviewed and secured.
   - Strengthen monitoring and alerting mechanisms across similar systems to detect similar patterns of activity.
   - Conduct an incident response drill if not already in place to better prepare for future incidents."
Compress Data for Exfiltration With Rar,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators and logs have raised questions regarding potential malicious activity. Here is a detailed breakdown of observations:

#### Security Log:
1. **Event ID 1102**: The security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a serious red flag as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks and is a common tactic seen in malicious activity.
   
2. **Event ID 4624**: A logon event via `Advapi` which corresponds to a service logon. This seems benign, as it's a process often occurring in system operations.

3. **Event ID 4672**: Special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM account (SeDebugPrivilege, among others). Although typical for SYSTEM operations, it should be monitored contextually with other activities.

#### System Log:
- **Event ID 104**: The system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by `admin_test`. Like Event ID 1102, this is indicative of potentially nefarious activity aimed at erasing evidence.

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Process Creation Events**: 
  - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs. These actions were initiated by the user `admin_test`. The command `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <LogName>` was used to clear logs including System, Security, and Sysmon, which clearly demonstrates attempts to remove tracks.

- **Suspicious Command Line Execution** (EventRecordID 18006):
  - A command was observed being executed to archive (potentially exfiltrate) data: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""%programfiles%/WinRAR/Rar.exe"" a -r %USERPROFILE%\T1560.001-data.rar %USERPROFILE%\*.txt`. This suggests potential data compression for transfer, pointing to possible data exfiltration tactics aligning with the MITRE ATT&CK tactic T1560.001 (Archive Collected Data).

#### Application Log:
- **Regular Activity**: Observed normal activities like updates or initiation of services without evident correlation to suspicious actions.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed review, the following assessments are determined:

- **Suspicious Behaviors:**
  - Clearing of multiple event logs by `admin_test`.
  - Potential data exfiltration attempt via data archiving (use of WinRAR) and suspicious command-line operations.

- These activities resemble techniques often used by attackers post-compromise to clear their tracks and exfiltrate data.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. Conduct a comprehensive incident response:
   - Isolate the affected machine(s).
   - Preserve any remaining logs and collect volatile memory for deep analysis.
   - Review other network logs for any unusual traffic patterns correlating to this timeline.
   
2. Review and reinforce security policies:
   - Implement enhanced auditing on sensitive accounts.
   - Ensure all systems are updated with latest security patches and antivirus signatures.
   
3. Investigate the user's activities:
   - Interview `admin_test` and determine if these activities were sanctioned or explainable.
   - Analyze network activities and other system touches made by this account in proximity to these logs.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the evidence of log tampering to erase tracks and potential data exfiltration attempts, the activity in the logs is assessed as malicious. Immediate action is required to contain and further investigate the situation."
Windows Screencapture,"## Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several behaviors stand out, indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - In the System log, there are multiple instances of `EventID 104` indicating that the logs for different channels such as the System and Windows PowerShell have been cleared. This event was generated by the user `admin_test`. This is typically a red flag as clearing logs is often done in attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon log, there is evidence that `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear event logs. This process was executed by the user `admin_test` and had a high integrity level. The command lines used (`wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, etc.) reflect attempts to clear logs from essential channels which often implies an attempt to hide activity.

3. **Elevated Execution and Privilege**:
   - There are multiple `EventID 4672` events in the Security log indicating special privileges assigned to the `admin_test` account. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, which might have been used to manipulate critical system processes or read sensitive system data.

4. **PowerShell Commands with Potentially Malicious Intent**:
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of scripts that invoke system commands. Events with path `powershell.exe & {cmd /c start /b psr.exe /start …}` suggest the execution of commands that include mouse event simulations and potential screen capturing/screen actions using `psr.exe` (Problem Steps Recorder), which is highly suspicious in the context of normal operations and usage.

5. **Unexpected Task Automation**:
   - The `taskhostw.exe` process appears frequently in the logs with a high number of events associated with potential automated tasks. However, this itself isn't directly suspicious, but its parent-child relationship with possibly malicious activities raises concerns.

6. **Miscellaneous Anomalies**:
   - There were multiple instances of `sc.exe` starting various services possibly to manipulate system services running. While this might be part of normal operations, combined with other events, it adds up to the overall suspicion.

## Assessment

- **Threats and Risks Identified**:
  - There is a clear pattern of behavior that is characteristic of adversary execution: log tampering, execution of PowerShell scripts with encoded/mixed commands, and utilization of high privileges for possible persistence or attack activities.

- **Impact**:
  - These actions could imply information gathering, evasion, or lateral movement preparation by a potential threat actor.

- **Resolution**:
  - Based on the evidence of logs being cleared, unusual PowerShell commands, exploitation of high privilege user accounts, and other suspicious processes, the situation points towards coordinated malicious activity rather than accidental or benign.

## Conclusion

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- Immediately conduct an incident response investigation to identify all potential compromised areas.
- Isolate the affected system to prevent further damage or lateral spread within the network.
- Reset credentials and review user permissions for the `admin_test` account and others with privileged access.
- Examine the network for any signs of compromise on other systems.
- Consider restoring the system from a known clean backup given the possibility of deep compromise.
- Strengthen logging and monitoring post-incident to ensure similar activities are detected earlier in the future."
Collect Clipboard Data via VBA,"## Analysis of Logs

### Summary

The provided logs include Windows PowerShell, Security, Sysmon, Application, and System logs, indicating various suspicious activities on the Windows host `Server002`. They suggest potential malicious behavior based on the following key observations:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed that involved downloading and executing a script from a remote URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This script execution appears linked with a testing framework from Red Canary's Atomic Red Team. The script was used to interact with Microsoft's Word via macros, a common vector for malware delivery.
   
2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of event logs being cleared, which is a technique often used by adversaries to cover their tracks. Specifically, the security log (EventID 1102) and system logs (EventID 104) were cleared by the user `admin_test`.

3. **Executing `wevtutil`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used to clear several logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The frequent use of this utility, paired with log clearing, signals an attempt to hide activities on the system.

4. **Use of High Integrity Process:**
   - The suspicious activities were executed under processes with high integrity levels, which implies that they had administrative privileges. The user involved in these operations was `SERVER002\admin_test`, which suggests either high-level access misuse or compromise.

5. **Normal Microsoft Edge Activities:**
   - While there are numerous Microsoft Edge update processes, which are typical background operations for maintaining application updates, these don't appear directly linked to the suspicious activity regarding PowerShell and event log manipulation.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, the logs predominantly indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activity:
- **Suspicious PowerShell execution** implies indicators of potential compromise, as the execution of commands related to known cybersecurity testing tools without explicit permission or context in logs could mimic real malicious attempts.
- **Cleared event logs** are consistent with tactics used to conceal tracks, frequently associated with malicious acts on compromised systems.

### Threats/Risks Identified

- **Potential System Compromise**: The system might be at risk of data exfiltration, lateral movement within the network, or other adversarial actions owing to the indicated privilege abuse and suspicious command execution.
- **Undetected Malicious Code**: The downloaded scripts can introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors unnoticed.

### Guidance and Resolution

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the activities carried out by the user `admin_test`. Ascertain the legitimacy of the PowerShell command execution and the context under which the event clearing occurred.
2. **Review User Accounts**: Audit activities of accounts with administrative privileges and monitor for anomalies in usage patterns.
3. **Network Monitoring**: Implement ongoing monitoring for abnormal behavior in network traffic coming from or going to `Server002`, focusing on data leaving the network.

- Implement stricter monitoring of PowerShell and command-line executions in the environment."
Email Collection with PowerShell Get-Inbox,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several key findings indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command Lines:**
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with the ""executionpolicy bypass"" flag and a script located in a temporary directory, intended to extract mailbox data (`Get-Inbox.ps1`). Specifically, event logs indicate this script. This behavior is suspicious because bypassing execution policies is often used to evade security controls and run potentially harmful scripts.
   
2. **Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple logs (Security, System, and PowerShell channels) have been cleared around the same timeframe (as evidenced by Event ID 1102 and 104 in the logs). Log clearing is a common tactic by threat actors to cover their tracks post-compromise or during an offensive operation.

3. **Process and User Context:**
   - All concerning activities, including suspicious PowerShell commands and log clearing, were carried out under the `admin_test` user account. This could indicate either misuse of legitimate credentials or compromise of an account with high privileges.

4. **Command Line Usage and Execution Context:**
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs and the fact it ran under a high-integrity level hints at possible privilege misuse or escalation. The terminal session ID being `0` also suggests these activities could have been performed via a script or automation instead of a GUI.

5. **Atomic Red Team Evidence:**
   - The provided logs refer to a directory and script associated with Atomic Red Team (`AtomicRedTeam\\T1114.001`). Atomic Red Team scripts are often used to simulate adversary behavior. The presence of these scripts could indicate simulation or, potentially, misuse by an unauthorized party to harvest email data.

Given the combination of suspicious PowerShell commands, log clearing operations, and potential misuse of administrative credentials, the activity observed in the logs raises significant red flags consistent with malicious behavior.

2. **Credential Audit:**
   - Perform a thorough audit of accounts with administrative privileges to detect any signs of misuse or unauthorized access. Consider credential resets or account disablement for `admin_test`.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on Server002, focusing on disk images and memory captures to identify any persistent threats, data exfiltration, or rootkits.

4. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Re-evaluate power and system administrator usage and distribution of PowerShell scripts in your organization. Implement strictest execution policies and enhance monitoring for bypass attempts.

5. **Log Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Increase monitoring granularity on Admin activities and log clear events. Set alerts for execution policy changes and the usage of `wevtutil.exe`.

These steps are crucial to addressing the detected threats, determining the extent of the compromise, and preventing similar incidents in the future."
Windows Screen Capture (CopyFromScreen),"### Detailed Analysis

#### Evidence of Suspicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Usage for Screen Capture**:
   - In the PowerShell log, there is a command that uses PowerShell to take a screenshot of the virtual screen and save it as `T1113.png` in the system's TEMP directory. The use of the `[Windows.Forms.SystemInformation]::VirtualScreen` and following commands indicate that the screen capture is likely being done without user consent or through a non-standard process, which is consistent with tactics used in malware or unauthorized surveillance activities.
   - The PowerShell command:
     ```powershell
     Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms
     $screen = [Windows.Forms.SystemInformation]::VirtualScreen
     $bitmap = New-Object Drawing.Bitmap $screen.Width, $screen.Height
     $graphic = [Drawing.Graphics]::FromImage($bitmap)
     $graphic.CopyFromScreen($screen.Left, $screen.Top, 0, 0, $bitmap.Size)
     $bitmap.Save(""$env:TEMP\\T1113.png"")
     ```

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The Security and System logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (event IDs 1102 in Security and 104 in System). Clearing event logs is often done to cover tracks and is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as it aims to remove evidence of activities from system logs.
   - The suspicious activity was performed by the user `admin_test`, which indicates potential misuse of administrative privileges to execute these commands.

3. **Correlation between Log Entries**:
   - The PowerShell script execution and event log clearing appear closely timed, with sequence numbers showing concurrent transitions of the system states. This coordination suggests a deliberate attempt to both execute unauthorized actions and hide evidence through log clearance.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The combination of unauthorized screen capture and immediate log clearing suggests a compromise aimed at data exfiltration or espionage, potentially involving an insider threat given the use of administrative account credentials.

### Assessment:

The logs present concrete evidence of potentially unauthorized and malicious behavior, specifically through the exploitation of PowerShell to execute a screen capture and subsequent clearance of logs, likely aimed to hide this activity. The usage of admin-level accounts further emphasizes the potential severity of the breach.

Compress Data and lock with password for Exfiltration with winrar,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The logs show repeated clearing of system, PowerShell, and security logs by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Specifically, the commands used were `wevtutil.exe cl` which is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks by deleting evidence (Event ID 104 in System log and Event ID 1102 in Security log).

2. **Frequent Command Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `cmd.exe` by `admin_test`, including suspicious command arguments such as using `WinRAR` with the `-hp` flag (which indicates password protection) and creating a directory (`mkdir .\tmp\victim-files`) where a file is echoed (`echo ""This file will be encrypted""`). This type of activity could suggest file manipulation or potential ransomware activity.

3. **Processes Executed with High Integrity Level:**
   - Commands executed from command prompt and other binaries with high integrity level, suggesting they have significant privileges.

4. **Chained Command Execution:**
   - Multiple usage of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to clear logs suggests efforts to mask actions on the system. The processes stemmed from `wsmprovhost.exe` which indicates possible PowerShell or WMI manipulation.

5. **Use of System Utilities with Logs Clearing Context:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` used in clearing multiple logs:
     - Clearing Sysmon logs
     - Clearing Application logs
     - Clearing Windows PowerShell logs

6. **Potential Malicious Command Line Usage:**
   - `cmd.exe` utilized with a specific command sequence that suggests scripting actions:
     - Creation of directories
     - Usage of `echo` for file creation
     - Potential file archiving with password protection involving `WinRAR`

### Analysis of Log Behavior:

1. **Log Tampering:**
   - Active clearing of key system logs, including the Sysmon, PowerShell, System, and Security logs is a significant indicator of log tampering potentially attempting to erase footprints of illicit activities.

2. **Process Creation Events:**
   - The logs have frequent Microsoft Edge Update activity; however, this is likely a coincidence as it starts and runs system processes legitimately, yet overlaps with log clearing times.

3. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - Evidence of elevated privileges is present with `SeDebugPrivilege` among other key administrative rights.

### Assessment:

Given these observations, the reported activity on `Server002` associated with the user `admin_test` strongly suggests malicious behavior. The continuous log clearing, process creation indicative of preparation for or execution of ransomware-like activities, coupled with the use of system utilities and command lines in a manner consistent with illicit activities, warrant categorization of this incident as confirmed **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommendations for Resolution:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or continuation of malicious activity.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation, including memory analysis, to capture any persistent malicious processes or tools.
   
2. **Review Access Privileges:**
   - Audit user privileges and assess if `admin_test` privileges are necessary or if they're exploited.

3. **Strengthen Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced logging policies and forward all event logs to a secure, centralized system that cannot be altered by local administrators.

4. **Conduct Security Awareness:**
   - Train staff on recognizing and responding to suspicious activities, with an emphasis on access controls and logging integrity.

In conclusion, the activities observed in these logs align with tactics associated with advanced persistent threats, warranting swift and decisive action."
using device audio capture commandlet,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries indicate that the event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared (`EventID 104` for System and PowerShell logs and `EventID 1102` for Security log). This is performed by the user `admin_test`, and log clearing is often a sign of an attacker trying to hide their tracks.

2. **Unusual Process Executions:**
   - Several instances of legitimate system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) being executed by the user `admin_test` are noted. These utilities can be used to gather information or manipulate logs.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with the command line `""powershell.exe & {powershell.exe -Command WindowsAudioDevice-Powershell-Cmdlet}""` could be suspicious. PowerShell is frequently used in attacks to execute scripts due to its powerful capabilities. The context or exact origin of this command isn't clear and may require further investigation.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - In the logs, there are `EventID 4616` indicating a system time change by the process `svchost.exe`, although attributed to `LOCAL SERVICE`. While not inherently malicious, it is often associated with system spoofing or evasion tactics.

#### Indicators of Compromise

- **Clearing of Logs:**
  - Clearing logs under the account `admin_test` strongly suggests malicious intent, as it could be an attempt to cover the tracks of unauthorized activities carried out on the system.

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
  - Execution of PowerShell scripts with unusual or obfuscated commands might be concerning and should be investigated further.

### Threat Assessment

The combination of event log clearance, execution of utility tools capable of altering and deleting logs, and suspicious PowerShell activity suggests that there is a high likelihood of unauthorized or malicious activity on the system covered up by an insider or an attacker using an administrator account.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential compromises.
   - Preserve the current state and gather full memory dumps and disk images for further forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of user account `admin_test` activities to determine if it has been compromised.
   - Analyze all recent changes and accesses, particularly those involving sensitive data or critical systems.
   - Investigate network logs and other endpoints for lateral movement and potential exfiltration attempts.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting, especially for PowerShell execution and event log manipulation.
   - Consider implementing stricter access controls and regular auditing of administrative activities.
   - Review and enhance endpoint security measures to detect and prevent similar activities in the future."
Windows Recall Feature Enabled - DisableAIDataAnalysis Value Deleted,"Below is the analysis of the provided logs:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
The logs indicate multiple PowerShell executions with commands related to registry modifications:
1. Use of `reg add` and `reg delete` commands to modify a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI`. The PowerShell commands executed are:
    - `reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI"" /v DisableAIDataAnalysis /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
    - `reg delete ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsAI"" /v DisableAIDataAnalysis /f`

This activity is suspicious as it involves direct modification of the registry keys, which could potentially be used to alter system behavior or settings, possibly for malicious purposes.

### Application Logs
The application logs appear normal, indicating routine software protection platform service activities and Microsoft Edge updates. No anomalies are detected here.

### Security Logs
1. Event ID 1102 (""Audit log cleared"") is triggered by the user `admin_test`. Clearing audit logs is suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks after performing unauthorized actions.
2. Time synchronization events do not indicate malicious activity but can sometimes be used to manipulate timestamps in logs.

### Sysmon Logs
Several Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs:
- Commands like `wevtutil.exe cl [Log Name]` were used to clear logs (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`).
- The user `admin_test` also executed `wevtutil.exe` to clear PowerShell logs.

The presence of log-clearing activity strongly suggests an attempt to obfuscate unauthorized actions. It is unusual, especially when executed by a user account that is named similarly to a generic admin account and clearing critical logs.

### System Logs
System log entries also reflect log clearing activities initiated by the user `admin_test`.

### Overall Assessment
The evidence from the logs suggests activities that align closely with malicious behavior:
- **Registry Modifications**: Changes to registry keys using PowerShell could imply an attempt to modify system settings potentially for malicious reasons.
- **Log Clearing**: The clearing of event logs is a significant red flag, as it may indicate an attempt to remove traces of unauthorized activities.
  
Given the aforementioned points, the activities observed in the logs could indicate a compromise of the system.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The logs display clear signs of malicious activity. The registry changes and log-clearing steps highly suggest an attempt to hide unauthorized or harmful actions.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or infection spread.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the affected system to determine the scope and impact of the compromise.
3. **Review Access**: Review user access rights, especially for the `admin_test` account. Consider rotating credentials for sensitive accounts and enforce stricter permissions.
4. **Security Policy Update**: Update security policies to include real-time monitoring and alerts for registry changes and log-clearing activities.
5. **Incident Report**: Document the incident in detail and report to cybersecurity leadership for further action and awareness.

These steps aim to mitigate the threat and strengthen the security posture against similar future incidents."
Zip a Folder with PowerShell for Staging in Temp,"## Log Analysis and Findings:

### PowerShell Logs:
1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a consistent pattern of PowerShell activity on the machine `Server002` with the user `ADMIN_~1`, which attempts to execute a command to archive a folder: `""powershell.exe & {Compress-Archive -Path \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1074.001\\bin\\Folder_to_zip\"" -DestinationPath $env:TEMP\\Folder_to_zip.zip -Force}""`.
   - The usage of `Compress-Archive` itself is not inherently malicious; however, the folder path `AtomicRedTeam` suggests testing of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) linked with threat emulation, often used for red teaming.

### Sysmon Logs:
1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - Several `wevtutil.exe` command lines identified, such as `""wevtutil.exe cl Application""`, clearing the logs of Application, System, and Windows PowerShell.
   - Log clearing is a tactic often used by adversaries post-exploitation to cover tracks, which is suspicious in this context unless justified by administrative tasks.

2. **Utility Executions**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` indicates user enumeration, which is commonly used for reconnaissance purposes.
   - The executable `wsmprovhost.exe` is seen launching several utilities; it’s generally associated with Windows Remote Management (WinRM) and whilst its presence can be legitimate, it can also be leveraged for remote command execution.

### System and Security Logs:
1. **Log File Clearing Event IDs**:
   - Event IDs `1102` from the Security log, `104` from the System log indicate that audit logs have been cleared. The responsible user was `admin_test`. This is a critical indicator of post-compromise activity.
   
2. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616)**:
   - Time on the system was changed, potentially indicating tampering with the system clock. Time changes can be used to mitigate time-based detection or log analysis.

### Assessment:
- There’s a notable presence of tools and tactics consistent with penetration testing activities or malicious compromise.
- The clearing of logs (`wevtutil.exe cl`) and use of atomic testing paths indicate activities that are non-standard for regular user behavior.
- While there is no overt compromise directly visible from these logs, the combination of log clearance and use of path `AtomicRedTeam` aligns with red teaming or adversary simulation.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- Based on the analysis, the log entries contain activity that is suspicious and warrants further investigation to ensure there's no security breach. There are potential indicators of red team activity possibly without corresponding authorization or documentation, or potentially prelude malicious actions.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **User Validation**: Investigate if this was authorized testing activity by the IT security or red team. Validate with responsible parties.
2. **Audit Administrative Actions**: Check if `admin_test` had any approved reasons for deleting logs or other sensitive operations.
3. **Review System Integrity**: Assess further systems for similar activity patterns and confirm whether activities align with known good practices.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of critical systems to alert on similar or related suspicious activities in real-time.
5. **Logging Improvement**: Ensure that logs are backed up before clearance, and enable auditing for PowerShell scripting and related red team activities."
Registry artefact when application use webcam,"**Analysis of the Event Logs:**

1. **Security Log (Event ID 1102) - Log File Cleared:**
   - **EventID 1102** indicates that the security log was cleared. The event was performed under the username `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. The log was cleared shortly after a series of commands and file operations, which can indicate malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - **Frequent Execution of Built-In Tools:** There's frequent execution of Windows built-in utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. While these can be used for legitimate administrative purposes, rapid succession execution and interaction with registry keys can indicate potential misuse or reconnaissance activities.
   - **Registry Key Modification:** The execution of `cmd.exe` with specific registry modification commands for a file named `atomic.exe` in `C:\Windows\Temp\` is particularly suspicious. Such behavior can be indicative of persistence strategies or post-exploitation activities.
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Event Logs:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` with the purpose to clear various logs such as Security, Application, and System, are flagged. This aligns with attempts to cover attacker activity.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
   - **Log Clearing Messages:** Entry logs indicate the clearing of the system and Windows PowerShell logs was performed by `admin_test`. This again suggests an attempt to remove traces of system activity.

4. **Application Log Analysis:** 
   - The activities within the Application log, including the stopping of services such as `edgeupdate`, seem routine and might be related to regular software operation or updates. However, the timing in conjunction with other suspicious activities suggests potential cover-up or disruption actions during an unauthorized session.

**Assessing Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- The presence of multiple unauthorized registry modifications, clearing crucial logs including security, system, and PowerShell, alongside the consistency in timestamps indicating a possible timeline coordination strongly suggests malicious behavior.
- Although some of the events can occur as part of legitimate administrative tasks, the combination and sequencing heavily lean towards a coordinated effort to manipulate system configurations and hide traces of activity, indicative of a potential compromise.

**Verdict:** Based on the analysis of logs demonstrating unusual and potentially unauthorized actions, especially involving log clearing and registry changes, the resolution is categorized as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the system.
   - Ensure event logs on other systems are secure and monitored.
  
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Examine any active sessions or other accounts with similar unauthorized activities.

Azure - Scan for Anonymous Access to Azure Storage (Powershell),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity on the Windows host.

### Key Findings:

1. **Event Logs Cleared**:
   - **Security Event ID 1102** and **System Event ID 104**: These events indicate that event logs were cleared, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. Typically, attackers clear logs to erase traces of their actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple PowerShell logs include commands attempting to reach an external URL (`https://T1530Test2.blob.core.windows.net//`) using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This behavior can indicate data exfiltration or downloading additional malicious payloads, especially executed by the `admin_test` user.
   - Characteristics of the executed PowerShell commands align with tactics for testing or simulating fileless malware, which often leverages PowerShell for execution.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - Sysmon logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear different logs, including Security and Windows PowerShell logs. The use of `wevtutil.exe` in this context further corroborates log tampering.

4. **Integrity Level and Execution**:
   - The execution of scripts and commands in a high integrity context by the `admin_test` account suggests privilege misuse or compromise.

5. **External Network Communication**:
   - The PowerShell script tries to anonymously access an external storage account, indicating potential unauthorized data access or manipulation attempts.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis of log entries, the activities recorded are indicative of **malicious behavior**:

- **Log clearing**: often associated with attackers trying to cover their tracks.
- **PowerShell scripts accessing external resources**: common in post-exploitation scenarios for data exfiltration or command/control traffic.

### Recommendations to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Isolate the compromised host** to prevent further network communication and potential data exfiltration.
   - **Conduct a deeper forensic investigation** to identify the initial point of entry, payloads delivered, and any lateral movements.

**MALICIOUS**"
Automated Collection Command Prompt,"Upon examining the provided logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious and malicious activity are visible in the timeline:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared according to the events recorded in the System and Security logs:
   - **System Log (EventID: 104)**: Indicates that the event log for System was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This event appears twice.
   - **Security Log (EventID: 1102)**: Indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - The presence of these logs being cleared almost simultaneously suggests an attempt to cover tracks and is a classic indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**: In the Sysmon logs:
   - A process with **EventID: 1** shows that `wevtutil.exe` was executed with the command-line option to clear logs (`cl`) for multiple log groups such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
   - This aligns with the log clearance events mentioned above and corroborates the suspicion of log tampering to hide actions on the system.

3. **Suspicious Command-Line Arguments**: In Sysmon log:
   - **EventID: 1** logs the execution of a command to collect documents: ```cmd.exe /c mkdir %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection >nul 2>&1 & dir c: /b /s .docx | findstr /e .docx & for /R c:\ %f in (*.docx) do copy /Y %f %temp%\T1119_command_prompt_collection```. 
   - This command indicates suspicious automation of file collection, which can be associated with data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity.

4. **Elevation and Privilege Assignment**: The Security log with **EventID: 4672** shows special privileges assigned such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which indicates that an account is operating with elevated system privileges. While not necessarily malicious by itself, combined with log clearing, this raises concerns.

5. **Unauthorized Access and Execution Context**: 
   - **EventID: 4624**: Many logon events utilizing NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account with high privileges. This by itself might be typical in certain system processes but coupled with the cleared logs and other contexts, it is concerning.
   - Legitimate processes such as Windows Update (`edgeupdate.exe`) and system tasks are occurring, likely attempting to cover or mix with regular system activities.

### Conclusion:
Based on the logs provided, there is clear evidence of potentially malicious activity:
- Log clearing actions, coupled with suspicious commands executed to clear event logs and collect document files.
- The suspicious sequence of events and commands executed indicates an attempt at hiding tracks and possibly manipulating or exfiltrating data.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The detailed investigation suggests unauthorized, potentially harmful actions were performed on the host system, indicating compromise.

### Guidance:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent potential lateral movement.
- Perform a thorough investigation to trace back the entry point and method of compromise.
- Review and enhance logging and alert configurations for early detection in the future.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to identify the extent of data access or exfiltration.
