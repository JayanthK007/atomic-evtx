WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - Safetykatz,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Summary:

The logs reveal the execution of several events, but the most concerning ones relate to the use of PowerShell. The following behaviors have been identified and analyzed:

1. **Log Clearing**:
   - **Event 104 (System) and 1102 (Security)**: Logs cleared by user ""admin_test."" It is unusual for logs to be cleared unless there's a specific administrative reason, typically suggesting an attempt to obscure actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell script being executed that involves a download from GitHub (i.e., `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This behavior is characteristic of ""living-off-the-land"" techniques where built-in tools are used for malicious purposes.
   - This particular script seems related to privilege escalation or theft of sensitive information, as suggested by references like `safedump`.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - This utility is used to clear the event log channels (Application, System, Security). The legitimate use of `wevtutil.exe` should be audited for administrative justification, failing which it likely supports malicious goals.

4. **Time Changes (Event 4616 security)**:
   - Minor system time adjustments are logged. Such events aren't inherently malicious but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, they could be artifacts of attempts to manipulate logs or timestamps.

5. **Kernel-General and Time-Service Logs**:
   - No immediate abnormality was found here in isolation, but when combined with the above, they add context to time manipulation or evasion tactics.

#### Assessment:
The combination of cleared logs, unauthorized PowerShell script execution, and the clearing of event logs indicates a potential compromise on ""Server002,"" specifically targeting activities that aim to perform operations without detections such as privilege escalation scripts and log evasion techniques.

#### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Recommendation**:
   - Ensure the compromised machine is isolated from the network to prevent any data exfiltration or spread of malicious activities.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper analysis to determine if any bits of sensitive data were accessed or exfiltrated by the malicious script.
   - Identify any unusual outbound connections that could suggest communication with command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.
   
3. **Mitigation**:
   - Implement security patches and updates on the system.
   - Enhance monitoring, especially around high-privilege accounts accessing sensitive tools and areas.
   - Review and audit account activities for ""admin_test"" and similar accounts.

4. **Incident Response**:
   - Begin an incident report, involving a full scope of users and impacts.
   - Coordinate with legal and public affairs if there has been a breach that might affect customer or client data.
  
5. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Collect memory and disk images for a thorough forensic analysis to identify the techniques and malware involved.
   - Reverse engineer the script or any identified binaries to understand the full scope and objective of the malicious activity.

This is a confirmed case of malicious activity requiring an immediate and comprehensive response to mitigate further risks."
Download Macro-Enabled Phishing Attachment,"Based on the provided collection of event logs from various channels (Windows PowerShell, Security, Application, Sysmon, and System), here is a detailed analysis of suspicious activities:

### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
- **PowerShell Log Entries:**
  - The PowerShell logs show a PowerShell command that downloads a file named `PhishingAttachment.xlsm` from a URL associated with GitHub, specifically from the repository of the Atomic Red Team project. The command used is `Invoke-WebRequest`, which is typical in scripting and automation but potentially suspicious when used to download files, particularly with a filename that suggests phishing activity.
  
  - **Suspicious Behavior:**
    - The activity points towards a potential phishing test scenario carried out using Atomic Red Team's repository, which provides various red teaming techniques, including phishing simulations. While it could be authorized penetration testing, it still necessitates validation due to the nature of the file and command.

### 2. **Event Log Clearing:**
- **Security and System Logs:**
  - Event logs show that event log channels were cleared (`EventID 1102` for the Security log and `EventID 104` for the System log). The actor `SERVER002\admin_test` used the command line utility `wevtutil.exe` to clear these logs (`cl` command is shorthand for ""clear log"").

  - **Suspicious Behavior:**
    - Clearing event logs can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks. Combined with the suspicious PowerShell activity, this points towards a potential compromise or malicious activity.
  
### 3. **Time Change:**
- **System Logs:**
  - A small time discrepancy is logged but appears to be due to the system synchronizing time with `time.windows.com`. This is typical behavior and not usually indicative of malicious activity unless manipulated to disrupt log timelines.

### 4. **Additional Observations:**
- **Application and Sysmon Logs:**
  - Updates for Microsoft Edge are logged, showing typical system update behavior. However, the combination of clearing logs and suspicious PowerShell activities overshadows this benign activity.

### Assessment:
- The presence of downloaded potentially malicious content (`PhishingAttachment.xlsm`), and the clearing of security and system logs indicate efforts to conceal potentially harmful actions or simulations.

### Recommendation:
1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - This activity should be promptly assessed as malicious based on the combined findings of a suspicious download and event log clearing.
  
2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify the legitimacy of the download from the GitHub repository through direct communication with authorized IT or security personnel to rule out it being part of a sanctioned test.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of the machine `Server002` for indicators of compromise, focusing on unauthorized network connections, modified files, or presence of unexpected processes.
   - Assess if the account `admin_test` has been compromised and review its recent actions to determine if they align with expected behavior.

3. **Future Measures:**
   - Reinforce incident detection and response strategies to include alerts for event log clearing and abnormal PowerShell usage.
   - Ensure effective privileges management to minimize the risk of administrative accounts performing unauthorized actions.
  
Taking these actions will help contain any potential threat, ascertain the extent of the compromise, and secure the environment moving forward."
Create local account with admin privileges,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out, indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events (EventID 104)**: The logs indicate that the system, Windows PowerShell, and potentially other logs have been cleared by the user 'admin_test'. Clearing of logs is a common technique used by attackers to hide their tracks and should be treated as highly suspicious.

2. **Event ID 1102** in the Security event log indicates that the security log has been cleared, which is particularly concerning as it might indicate an effort to cover malicious activities on the system.

3. **Abnormal Process Executions**: 
   - There are numerous instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear logs. This includes clearing the Windows Sysmon, Application, and other system logs. The process execution by 'admin_test' with high integrity level further flags this as unusual and potentially malicious.
   - A command-line execution (`cmd.exe`) that adds a new user account `art-test` and adds it to the local administrators group (`net user art-test /add & net user art-test -4RTisCool!-321 & net localgroup administrators art-test /add`) is observed. This is a clear indicator of privilege escalation and unauthorized user account manipulation.

4. **Account Events** (EventIDs 4720, 4722, 4732, 4738, 4728): The creation and manipulation of the account `art-test` is detailed in the logs, which includes adding it to privileged groups. This activity by `admin_test` strongly suggests an attempt at privilege escalation and persistence.

5. **Process Integrity Levels**: Several processes are executed with high integrity levels, including whoami.exe, which could indicate that elevated privileges were obtained.

6. **Time Change Events** (EventID 4616): There are records of time adjustment on the system, which can be used as a method to manipulate timestamps on logs, again hinting at hiding malicious activities.

Based on these observations, there is strong evidence of unauthorized and potentially malicious activity on the system, particularly considering the log clearing, user account manipulation, and attempts to escalate privileges.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions:**
- Immediately isolate the system `Server002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to understand the extent of the breach and any additional compromised systems.
- Review the `admin_test` account activities and verify authorization as this account likely has elevated privileges and is involved in suspicious activities.
- Reset credentials for potentially compromised accounts, especially the `admin_test` and newly created `art-test`.
- Inspect other systems in the network for similar activities.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and logging to detect similar activities in the future.
- Conduct a thorough security review and patch any discovered vulnerabilities that could have allowed this access."
Activate Guest Account,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Logon Activity and Command Execution:**
   - **A sequence of process creations** with `wevtutil.exe` is observed, attempting to clear logs from different channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The command `wevtutil cl` is a known method to clear event logs. This activity was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges.

2. **Suspicious Process Activities:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c net user guest /active:yes` is noted, which indicates an attempt to activate the Guest account. This is a suspicious activity as enabling guest accounts can be used to create an anonymous entry point into the system.

3. **Cleared Logs:**
   - Both the **Security and System event logs were cleared** as evidenced by Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log. Log clearing is a common tactic used to cover tracks after unauthorized access.
   
4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are events indicating that the system time was changed, potentially suggesting an attempt to manipulate logs or schedules.

5. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There are multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge update processes. These appear to be standard activities for a system managing updates and do not exhibit obvious signs of compromise or deviation from normal operation patterns.

### Assessment:

- **Malicious Activity Detected:**
  - The combination of log clearing, suspicious command execution to enable the guest account, and usage of high privilege levels indicate an attempted or successful unauthorized access and potential cover-up of such activities.
  
### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate and isolate the system `Server002` to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a thorough inspection of user credentials, especially `admin_test`, for any unauthorized usage.
   - Review other systems for similar patterns to check if this incident is isolated or part of a larger breach.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform forensic investigation to trace back the source of unauthorized access.
   - Check for any additional backdoors or hidden accounts on the system.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Revoke any suspect or unauthorized user accounts or privileges.
   - Reset passwords and strengthen access control policies.

4. **Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring measures and alerts to detect unusual activities.
   - Review and update security policies, ensuring logs are monitored regularly and backups are taken to prevent log tampering."
Enable Guest account with RDP capability and admin privileges,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the investigation reveals the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
1. **Clearing Event Logs:** Multiple logs, including the System and Windows PowerShell logs, have been cleared by the user **admin_test** at the times captured in Event IDs 104 (System) and 1102 (Security). This activity often indicates an attempt to erase evidence of system changes or unauthorized access.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The `wevtutil cl` command was executed multiple times to clear logs. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Command Execution with Elevated Privileges:** Evidence from the Sysmon logs indicates the execution of a Windows Command Processor (`cmd.exe`) with a command line that includes:
   - Enabling the Guest account (`net user guest /active:yes`).
   - Adding the Guest account to the Administrators and Remote Desktop Users groups.
   - Tweaking terminal server settings to allow remote desktop connections.

4. **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:** The commands executed suggest that the attacker is trying to establish persistence and achieve privilege escalation by:
   - Enabling a normally disabled account (Guest).
   - Elevating this account's privileges to Administrators and Remote Desktop Users.
   - Modifying registry settings to allow remote desktop connections.

5. **Time Manipulation:** Log entries suggest manipulation of system time by a service running under `svchost.exe`. Such actions could potentially be used to alter timestamps in logs or enable time-sensitive operations for attacker advantage.

6. **Anomalous User Activity:** The user **admin_test** is observed performing system changes and interacting with processes typically associated with elevated privileges and administrative tasks.

### Assessment:
The combination of cleared event logs, suspicious user behavior, and command execution with privilege elevation strongly indicates malicious activity. This sequence of operations, including attempts to persist access via an enabled guest account and remote desktop modifications, aligns with known attacker techniques aimed at maintaining long-term access and control over a compromised host.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Remove the Guest account from Administrator and Remote Desktop Users groups.
   - Disable the Guest account if not in use or needed.

Word spawned a command shell and used an IP address in the command line,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

The logs provided display several instances of suspicious and potentially malicious activities on a Windows host. Here's a breakdown of the key findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Logs Cleared (Event ID 1102):** The logs indicate that the security event log was cleared by a user with the name `admin_test`. This can often be a red flag, as clearing event logs is a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared (Event ID 104):** The logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were also cleared, performed by the same user. This repeated behavior further indicates an effort to conceal malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Malicious PowerShell Command Execution:** The PowerShell log shows that a script was executed using PowerShell, which involved downloading and executing a script from a remote URL (""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1""). This script appears to modify and execute a macro in a Word document, a known technique used to exploit malicious documents.
   - **Command & Control Indicators:** The script included an IEX (Invoke-Expression), which is commonly used in PowerShell-based attacks to execute arbitrary commands or scripts retrieved from the internet.

3. **Privilege Escalation and High Privileges:**
   - **Privileges Assignment (Event ID 4672):** The SYSTEM account was granted extensive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and more. These privileges are powerful and can be used by malicious entities to perform various harmful activities, including manipulation of system components and access to sensitive data.

4. **Multiple Instances of EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - There are several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed. While Edge updates are legitimate processes, the high frequency and immediate correlation with other malicious activities raise suspicions about these processes being potentially exploited. Additionally, the files were executed with various command-line arguments in directories other than the typical update pathway.

5. **Sysmon Process Creations:**
   - **Event Clearing Utilities:** Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs was noted in Sysmon logs, consistent with the cleared event logs observed across multiple channels.
   - **Usage of Known Diagnostic Tools:** Processes like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, which could indicate enumeration activities.

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis:

- **Assessment:** The combination of log clearing activities, execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts, privilege escalation, and abnormal process activities suggest that a compromise has potentially occurred.

- **Risks Identified:** The primary risks include unauthorized access and control over the system, data theft, lateral movement within the network, and a persistent foothold by an attacker.

- **Guidance and Recommendations:**
  1. **Immediate Isolation:** Remove the affected machine from the network to prevent any further potential compromise or lateral movement by attackers.
  2. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a full forensic analysis on the isolated machine, focusing on the origin and impact of the PowerShell script and verifying any persistence mechanisms.
  3. **Audit and Review:** Review the activities of the `admin_test` account and consider resetting all credentials for accounts with elevated privileges.
  4. **Security Posture Enhancement:** Implement controls such as limiting PowerShell execution policies, enforcing strict logging and monitoring, and ensuring patches and updates are applied regularly.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity with multiple tactics suggesting compromise, which requires immediate attention and comprehensive investigation."
Octopus Scanner Malware Open Source Supply Chain,"Based on an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared within a very short timespan. This is evidenced by entries with EventID 1102 and EventID 104 in the security and system logs, respectively. Log clearing, especially security logs, is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Unusual System Commands**: The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility was used to clear logs, as indicated by multiple execution entries. This tool is used to manage the Event Log service; its usage for clearing logs, without administrative notification, can be highly suspicious.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**: A CMD command was executed (`""cmd.exe"" /c copy %%temp%%\\ExplorerSync.db %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db & schtasks /create /tn ExplorerSync /tr ""javaw -jar %%temp%%\\..\\Microsoft\\ExplorerSync.db"" /sc MINUTE /f`). This creates a scheduled task 'ExplorerSync' that runs a Java program, which strongly suggests malicious intent such as persistence mechanisms or arbitrary code execution.

4. **Scheduled Task Creation**: The use of `schtasks.exe` to create a task that executes suspicious commands reiterates an attempt to establish persistence or automated execution of potentially harmful operations.

Considering the identified patterns, the following assessment is made:

- The combination of security log clearing, execution of commands to establish persistence, and the creation of scheduled tasks collectively point towards an attempted or successful system compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system(s) from the network to prevent the potential spread of any threats.
   - Preserve the current state of the machine and thoroughly document evidence for further investigation.

2. **Thorough Investigation**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify the scale and impact of the intrusion.
   - Review user account activities, especially those of `admin_test`, for unauthorized access.
   - Analyze any discovered malicious binaries or scripts and determine the full attack vector and payload.

3. **Remediation and Strengthening**:
   - Rebuild compromised systems from known good images after confirming clean systems.
   - Update and patch all systems to ensure no known vulnerabilities exist.
   - Enhance logging and monitoring, employing SIEM solutions to better detect anomalies and potential threats.
   - Educate users on security best practices and establish strict user access controls and auditing.

Implement these countermeasures to effectively respond to the malicious activity and bolster system defenses against future threats."
Use PsExec to elevate to NT Authority\SYSTEM account,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified within the logs from the host, Server002. Here's an analysis:

1. **Clearing of Security Logs**:
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing security event logs is a common tactic to cover tracks after unauthorized access or suspicious activity.

2. **Usage of Sysinternals PsExec**:
   - Event ID 7045 in the System log shows the installation of a service named `PSEXESVC` associated with the PsExec utility. PsExec is a legitimate tool often used in enterprise environments for remote administration but can be leveraged by attackers for remote execution.

3. **Multiple Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - Events indicate the execution of Sysinternal's PsExec, specifically with the command line parameters suggesting privilege escalation to system-level commands (`-s` for SYSTEM level access) to execute `cmd.exe` for running `whoami`. This was found in the Sysmon logs and is associated with process IDs of known applications like `cmd.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which were executed with SYSTEM privileges.

4. **High-Value Privileges Gained by SYSTEM Account**:
   - Event IDs 4672 in the Security log indicate the SYSTEM account was granted multiple high-value privileges which could potentially be used to execute privileged operations that might be unauthorized.

5. **Network Connection Attempts to External Services**:
   - Although not explicit in the provided logs, the use of PsExec could involve connecting to, or executing processes on, remote systems which may not be authorized or intended based on the observed logs.

6. **Noisy Behavior and Failures**:
   - Several Event ID 5379 entries show failures related to credential operations, which might indicate attempted credential access or manipulation, echoing potentially unauthorized activity in tandem with the other findings.

Given the above points and the context of the logs, the activity observed is strongly indicative of unauthorized and potentially malicious behavior, especially given the log clearing, privilege escalation patterns, and use of administrative tools with SYSTEM privileges.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host to prevent any further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to perform a detailed forensic analysis of the machine and corroborate findings.
- **Network Monitoring**: Check for other suspicious activities across the network especially around the time frames mentioned.
- **Credential Reset**: Consider a reset for potentially compromised domain and local account credentials, given the suspicious activity involved.
- **Review and Enhance Security Controls**: Review administrative tool access and employ network segmentation and least privilege principles to mitigate further risks.

Further investigation and remediation actions should aim to ensure comprehensive containment and recovery from the identified threat."
WinPwn - Loot local Credentials - powerhell kittie,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity.

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell events indicating the execution of a suspicious PowerShell script (`WinPwn.ps1`) from a GitHub repository. The use of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` to execute scripts directly from the internet is a known method used by attackers to execute malicious payloads.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The logs show the execution of processes like `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` multiple times. While these processes are legitimate, they are noted running multiple times potentially obfuscated by commonly used system processes (like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`). This can be suspicious in the context of tampering with event logs, especially given that these followed the PowerShell execution.
   - `wsmprovhost.exe` appears as a parent process repeatedly, associated with the PowerShell activity. This could indicate remote administration or abusive use of the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

3. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are several events indicating that logs, including Security, Windows PowerShell, and System logs, have been cleared. This is often done to cover tracks by attackers post-exploitation.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are indications of system time being altered (event ID 4616) shortly before the logs were cleared. Changing system time can disrupt log timelines and further obscure malicious activity.

5. **Security Logs**:
   - An account with the username `admin_test` has performed actions consistent with maintaining elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), which is common post-compromise behavior.

Given the combination of script execution, log clearing, and privilege-seeking behavior, these logs present strong indicators of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to understand the extent of the compromise, including possible exfiltration of data.
- Reset credentials that may have been exposed, particularly for 'admin_test' and any associated administrative accounts.
- Review logs and network traffic around the timeframes noted for any lateral movement or other connected systems that may be compromised.
- Patch any vulnerabilities exploited by the attacker and ensure up-to-date endpoint protection is in place.
- Educate the user about safe scripting practices and reinforce the need for suspicious activity reporting."
USB Malware Spread Simulation,"Based on the log analysis, here are the key observations and conclusions:

### Analysis

#### Windows PowerShell Log
1. **Script Execution:**
   - The logs reveal a PowerShell script executing commands to identify removable drives on the system using `Get-WmiObject` and creating a file named `T1091Test1.txt` to simulate malware spread.
   - The script specifically mentions ""T1091 Test 1"" which indicates a test for Command-and-Control technique involving removable media.
   
#### System Log
2. **Event Clearing:**
   - There are recorded events of log files being cleared (Event ID 104) for the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the user `admin_test`. This behavior is suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs.
   
#### Sysmon Log
3. **Process Creation:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are recorded. `wevtutil.exe` is executing commands to clear logs like “Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational”, “Application”, and “System”. This corroborates the log clearing events indicating possible remediation actions following unauthorized or suspicious activity.

#### Security Log
4. **Log Cleared:**
   - Event ID 1102 shows the Security log being cleared by `admin_test`.
   
5. **Time Change:**
   - Time change is recorded by the process `svchost.exe`, which modifies the system time. This could point to potential attempts to obscure timelines or execute certain actions within a specific time frame.

### Conclusion

Considering the actions observed in the logs:

- **The use of PowerShell to look for removable drives and create potentially malicious files represents a suspicious activity.**
- **The clearing of logs, particularly by using `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs such as Application, System, and Security logs, is indicative of attempts to cover tracks, which is typically seen in malicious behaviors.**
- **Modifications to system time might be used to manipulate the logging features or to synchronize with additional actions during specific time frames if malicious activities are ongoing.**

Azure Persistence Automation Runbook Created or Modified,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of anomalous and potentially malicious activity have been identified:

### Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **Log Clearing Events**: There are multiple instances of event log clearing (`EventID 1102` in the Security log, and `EventID 104` in the System log). The user ""admin_test"" was responsible for these actions, and the corresponding process was `wevtutil.exe`. This tool is commonly used to clear logs, and its execution can often indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Scripted PowerShell Execution**: Within the PowerShell logs, a script was executed aiming to use Azure credentials, which is unusual administrative behavior unless expected for specific administrative tasks. The command employed possibly insecure practices by converting a password to a secure string from plain text, indicating poor security practices.

3. **Frequent Process Executions**: The Sysmon logs reveal numerous executions of processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, each associated with log clearing activities. These were all executed by the ""admin_test"" user with high integrity levels, further highlighting potential misuse by administrative privilege.

4. **Suspicious Command Lines**: The command-line arguments for `wevtutil.exe` show commands to clear the ""Security"", ""System"", ""Application"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs, which is concerning behavior unless explicitly justified by an IT policy.

### Findings:
- **Log Tampering**: Log clearing events coupled with `wevtutil.exe` usage by an admin-level user is a typical footprint for log tampering to cover malicious actions. This behavior is suspicious without legitimate reason.
- **Potential Credential Misuse**: Execution of PowerShell with parameters that could potentially connect to Azure using credentials indicates possible credential theft or misuse.

### Assessment:
This behavior requires further investigation, as it strongly indicates steps commonly associated with malicious insider activity or external attacker aiming to conceal unauthorized actions within the network.

### Resolution:
**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating the impacted system if not already done, to prevent potential further malicious actions.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on the account ""admin_test"" and related administrative accounts, looking out for further suspicious activities.
3. **Credential Check**: Verify if the credentials used in the PowerShell commands are compromised, and consider resetting them.
4. **Forensic Investigation**: Initiate a detailed forensic investigation on the system to validate if data exfiltration or further exploitation may have occurred.
5. **Review Logs and Policies**: Confirm the legitimacy of the log-clearing actions with administrative policies or manual audit trails, and tighten logging policies to prevent unauthorized log deletions.
6. **User Education**: Educate users, especially with admin access, on secure practices to ensure sensitive operations like PowerShell scripting incorporate security best practices.

These steps should help in confirming the extent and intent of the detected activities."
Running Chrome VPN Extensions via the Registry 2 vpn extension,"Upon examining the provided logs from various sources (Security, PowerShell, Application, System, and Sysmon), several suspicious activities stand out that warrant further investigation for potential malicious activities:

### Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102)**: The security logs show that the logs have been cleared by a user (`admin_test`). This is a significant event because clearing event logs is often an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity has occurred. This action typically requires elevated privileges.
   - **System Log (EventID 104)**: Log entries for multiple channels (System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the same user. Combined with the clearing of security logs, this suggests an attempt to hide malicious actions or activities.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - **PowerShell Log**: There are entries indicating the manipulation of Windows registry keys to add specific extensions (`fcfhplploccackoneaefokcmbjfbkenj`, `fdcgdnkidjaadafnichfpabhfomcebme`) to Chrome via PowerShell scripts. Registry modification via PowerShell without clear authorization/user initiation is a common method used for persistence or further exploitation.
   - The PowerShell script further includes starting and stopping Chrome, which may suggest an unauthorized attempt to manipulate the browser environment or install malicious extensions.

3. **Command-Line Utility Use**:
   - **Sysmon Log**: Multiple entries display the use of command line utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) by `admin_test` to clear event logs. The process and command line indicate that these actions were likely automated through scripting, which aligns with hiding traces.

4. **Highly Privileged Activities**:
   - **Security Log (EventID 4672)**: The log shows privileges being assigned which include a wide range of high-level privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege). Such extensive privileges are often targeted by attackers to perform unauthorized, potent activities on a system.
   - **Multiple Scheduled Tasks/Service Execution**: Various system-related processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`) have been executed with potential command lines that are typical for background tasks being manipulated or extended in a nefarious manner.

### Assessment:

The combination of log clearing, misuse of PowerShell scripts for registry manipulation, elevated privilege usage, and the presence of unusual command-line utility patterns strongly indicates suspicious and potential malicious activity. These patterns align with tactics and behaviors of unauthorized access and system exploitation.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS** 

The logs reflect malicious activity. There is clear evidence of attempts to cover tracks (log cleaning), unauthorized modification of system settings (via PowerShell), and the execution of scripts and commands that leverage high privileges.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent further potential spread of the threat within the network.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the machine to uncover the full scope of activities and any additional persistence mechanisms or payloads.
  
- **Incident Response**:
  - Change all potentially compromised credentials related to the domain and system.
  - Review and enhance security monitoring to catch any lingering threats or new attacks targeting privileged accounts.
  - Update firewall rules and intrusion detection systems to quickly identify and mitigate similar patterns in the future.

- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Conduct a thorough security audit of administrative permissions and highly privileged accounts.
  - Educate staff on the repercussions of log manipulation and suspicious PowerShell activities.
  - Ensure all critical security patches are applied and use application whitelisting to restrict PowerShell usage to trusted scripts only."
