Directory Name,AI Response
Modify VSS Service Permissions,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, here are the observations and conclusions:

1. **Event Log Clearing and Time Manipulation:**
   - The Security Log (Event ID 1102) indicates that the security event log was cleared by the user ""admin_test."" Log clearing is often a tactic used by threat actors to eliminate forensic evidence on systems they have compromised.
   - Multiple log events show changes in the system time. Manipulating time settings is a tactic used to hide the time of malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Privilege Use:**
   - There are logs indicating the use of high-level privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and `SeImpersonatePrivilege` by ""admin_test"" (Event ID 4672). These privileges provide significant access and could have been leveraged for malicious purposes.

3. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - A command via `cmd.exe` has been executed modifying the security descriptor of the VSS service (Process ID 6196), using the service management command `sc`. This action typically has high integrity and can be indicative of an attacker attempting to alter system configurations or privileges.

4. **Wevtutil Operations:**
   - The Sysmon logs record several processes where ""wevtutil.exe"" is used to clear different event logs like System, Application, Windows PowerShell. This supports the observation that an attempt was made to erase logs, contributing to covering tracks after suspicious activity.

5. **Executable Anomalies:**
   - The execution of ""whoami.exe"" and ""hostname.exe"" are not inherently malicious but in the context of clearing logs and privilege escalation, such actions could be part of an enumeration or reconnaissance script executed post-intrusion.
   
6. **Edge Update Processes:**
   - Microsoft Edge Update-related processes are logged frequently. However, they are common operations if Microsoft Edge is installed and frequently updated. They are not inherently suspicious unless they were executed with intent to masquerade malicious activities.

**Assessment:**

The combination of log clearing, time manipulation, execution of scripts or commands modifying system service permissions, along with the usage of high-level privileges suggests a potential malicious action. These activities collectively point towards an attempt to compromise the system, maintain persistence, and conceal actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
- Immediately investigate ""admin_test"" account for unauthorized access or actions.
- Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the host, server logs, and network activity at the time of these events.
- Review other systems for similar activities, as this could indicate wider network penetration.
- Consider isolating the affected system to prevent further spread or impact.
- Security measures like multi-factor authentication or restricting admin privileges should be enforced.
"
Disable System Restore Through Registry,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, several points of interest suggest potentially malicious activity:

1. **Registry Modifications via Command Line**:
   - There is a command executed by `cmd.exe` that disables the Windows System Restore feature:
     ```
     CommandLine"": ""cmd.exe /c reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableConfig"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f & reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableSR"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f & reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableConfig"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f & reg add ""HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\SystemRestore"" /v ""DisableSR"" /t ""REG_DWORD"" /d ""1"" /f""
     ```
   - Disabling system restore can be an indicator of malicious attempts to prevent system recovery, making this behavior highly suspicious.

2. **Clearing of Windows Event Logs**:
   - Windows event logs in both the System and Security channels were cleared:
     - EventID `104` in the System log.
     - EventID `1102` in the Security log.
   - These actions are performed by the account `admin_test`, which suggests an attempt to cover tracks, a common behavior associated with malicious activities.

3. **Execution of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed with the purpose of clearing logs, as seen with the command lines targeting different event logs (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell).
   - This further correlates with the clearing of logs noted above.

4. **High Integrity Level and Elevated Privileges**:
   - The processes, including those executing `whoami.exe` and `cmd.exe`, were running with a high integrity level and under the `admin_test` user account, indicating elevated privileges were used.

5. **Use of Common Tools in Suspicious Contexts**:
   - The use of tools such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, while benign in isolation, could be part of a larger chain of enumeration or exploitation activities, especially given the context of other suspicious activities.

**Assessment**:
The combination of registry modifications disabling system recovery features, clearing of system logs, and elevated command execution strongly indicates malicious behavior aiming to both disrupt forensic capabilities and potentially prepare the system for further compromise.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
1. **Containment**:
   - Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
   
2. **Investigation**:
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system, focusing on any persistence mechanisms, additional malware, or compromised accounts.
   - Review other logs and audit trails not covered here, such as firewall logs and network traffic, for further indications of compromise.

3. **Remediation**:
   - Remediate any discovered persistence mechanisms and confirm the attacker no longer has access.
   - Restore affected systems from known good backups where possible.

4. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Review and enhance logging and alerting, particularly around log-clearing activities and privilege use.
   - Implement and enforce least privilege principle to limit the capabilities of compromised accounts in the future.
"
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs:

I have analyzed the provided logs from different sources: Windows PowerShell, System, Application, Sysmon, and Security logs. Here are the observations based on potential suspicious activities:

#### 1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - **System Log:** 
     - Event ID 104 indicates the clearing of logs from the System and PowerShell channels by the user `admin_test`.
   - **Security Log:**
     - Event ID 1102 shows the clearing of Security logs by the user `admin_test`.

Clearing of logs, especially across multiple channels (System, PowerShell, and Security), is often associated with an attempt to cover tracks after malicious activities. Such actions are typically performed to avoid detection by security mechanisms or analysts.

#### 2. **PowerShell Activities:**
   - Although the PowerShell log content is not directly provided, **Sysmon logs** indicate PowerShell was invoked to run certain commands such as checking for shadow copies using `vssadmin.exe list shadows`. PowerShell being used to run administrative commands or file system operations could imply automation scripts potentially used for malicious purposes.

#### 3. **Process Executions and Command Line Usage:**
   - **VSSAdmin:** The use of `vssadmin.exe list shadows` may indicate reconnaissance of shadow copies, which is common in ransomware attacks to delete backups before encryption.
   - **Wevtutil:** Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear various event logs (`Sysmon/Operational`, `System`, `Application`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`) suggests deliberate attempts to erase logs and hide activities, often indicative of malicious operations.
   - **Cmd and Wmic:** The execution command `""cmd.exe"" /c wmic.exe shadowcopy delete` underlines attempts to delete shadow copies potentially to disrupt data recovery efforts.

#### 4. **Integrity Level and User Context:**

Windows - Disable the SR scheduled task,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Observations:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**:
   - The Sysmon log shows multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` process being executed. The command-line arguments `cl Application`, `cl System`, and `cl Security` indicate log clearing for Application, System, and Security event logs.

2. **Identities and Privilege Levels**:
   - The actions were conducted by the user `admin_test`, who operated with high integrity level privileges.

3. **Unusual Scheduling Activity**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executed with arguments to disable a system task using `schtasks.exe`. The specific command observed is: 
     ```
     ""cmd.exe"" /c schtasks.exe /Change /TN ""\Microsoft\Windows\SystemRestore\SR"" /disable
     ```
   - Disabling system restore points without legitimate reasons or planned maintenance is a strong indication of malicious activity.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - Processes such as `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` were executed. These tools are often used for reconnaissance.
   - Timing of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` closely aligns with the periods of log clearing.

5. **File Activity and System Updates**:
   - Multiple `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes executed, which appear to follow typical updating patterns, but given the context of other activities, could potentially be leveraged to disguise malicious actions.

6. **Time Change Events**:
   - There are multiple events showing the system time being changed. This can be an indicator of an attacker trying to cover tracks.

#### Threats and Risks Identified:

- **Log Clearing**: Clearing event logs is a classic indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after a compromise.
- **Scheduled Task Modification**: The disabling of a system restore task could potentially prevent recovery from malicious system alterations.
- **Privilege Level**: Actions were executed with high privileges, allowing significant system alterations.
- **Reconnaissance Tools**: Use of `hostname` and `whoami` suggests data gathering, possibly for further exploitation.

#### Assessment of the Situation:

The combination of log-clearing activities, disabling of system protection mechanisms, and the use of reconnaissance commands strongly implies that these logs contain evidence of unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. Given the presence of all these indicators, there’s a high risk that the system has been compromised.

ESXi - Avoslocker enumerates VMs and forcefully kills VMs,"## Detailed Analysis of the Logs

### Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:

1. **Process Execution Pattern**:
   - There is a sequence of Sysmon logs showing the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is used to clear event logs. The processes involved are `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`. The command line for `wevtutil.exe` includes several calls to clear logs from `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`.
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with potentially malicious intent is present in the logs. The CommandLine field shows a command involving `plink.exe`, a command-line SSH client, indicating a possible external communication attempt using SSH with credentials included (`-l ""root"" -pw ""pass""`).

2. **Log Deletion**:
   - The logs include events indicating that various log files such as `Sysmon`, `Windows PowerShell`, `Security`, and `System` logs were cleared. This is observed in:
     - **Security log**: `EventID 1102` shows the Security log was cleared by `admin_test`.
     - **System log**: `EventID 104` shows the System log was cleared.
   - Clearing event logs is often an indication of an attempt to cover tracks after potentially malicious activity.

3. **Execution of Known Malicious Tools**:
   - `AtomicRedTeam` references and the use of `plink.exe` suggest a simulation or test of adversarial behaviors, which might indicate intentional simulation of malicious activities potentially for red teaming. However, its execution alongside log clearing is highly suspicious.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:

- The combination of `wevtutil.exe` execution for log clearance and the subsequent execution of potentially malicious commands (`plink.exe`) together form a strong indication of malicious activity.
- The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the directory paths indicates the system may be running penetration testing scripts or has been compromised with test malware which mimics malicious activity.
- The user performing these actions is `SERVER002\admin_test`, which could imply misuse of admin privileges on the system.

## Assessment

Based on the log evidence, there is significant suspicious activity characteristic of malicious behavior, such as:
- Log deletion to cover tracks.
- Use of `ssh` with straight credentials, indicating potential data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
- Execution of tools associated with adversary simulation or potentially reconnaissance/malicious actions.

## Resolution

### **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

Given the combination of log wiping, execution of potentially harmful scripts, and command-line activity that resembles known adversarial patterns, the behavior observed qualifies as malicious. Immediate action should be taken to contain and remediate the threat, with further investigation into who initiated these actions and the full scope of the activities conducted. It is imperative to:
- Isolate the affected machine immediately.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the full scope.
- Implement additional security controls to prevent reoccurrence, such as monitoring, alerts for command executions like `wevtutil.exe`, and stronger administrative access controls."
Replace Desktop Wallpaper,"### Analysis of Logs

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior

1. **Log Clearing (`EventID: 104` and `EventID: 1102`)**:
   - Multiple events indicate that system, PowerShell, and security logs have been cleared by a user named `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. Cleared logs (EventID 104, 1102) are a strong indication that an action is attempting to cover traces of other activities, which is suspicious behavior.

2. **PowerShell Script Execution**:
   - A PowerShell session was initiated with the execution of a script that downloads an image from the internet and changes the wallpaper (`CommandLine` details in Windows PowerShell log and Sysmon log EventID 17976). The script uses PowerShell to create, execute, and potentially modify system settings to change the desktop wallpaper. This behavior is highly unusual for a legitimate user and can be a tactic used by attackers for persistence or to demonstrate system compromise.

3. **Use of WevtUtil.exe**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` process, which is used to clear Windows event logs, was executed multiple times by the user `admin_test` (Sysmon events: EventID 1 and 5). The process execution in conjunction with log clearing events suggests an attempt to remove evidence of potentially malicious activities.

4. **Process Activity Involving Edge Update**:
   - Various processes related to Microsoft Edge Update (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup_X86_1.3.195.27.exe`) are seen running with high frequency within a short span (Events in Sysmon log). Though these could be legitimate update processes, the timing and frequency indicate the need for further investigation to rule out any abnormal behavior.

5. **Time Manipulation Events**:
   - Kernel-General and Security-Auditing logs (EventID 4616) indicate changes to the system time. Although not inherently malicious, changing system time can be used to manipulate timestamps of logs and processes to obfuscate activities.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise

- **Log Clearance**: Clearing event logs without an approved change control or system maintenance is inherently suspicious and often indicative of malicious activity, especially when executed by an atypical administrator account such as `admin_test`.

- **Potential Persistence Mechanism**: The PowerShell script not only changes the wallpaper but could be used as a persistence mechanism by executing remote code or altering the system's state surreptitiously.

- **Executing Unsigned Scripts**: The execution script involves downloading content from the internet and using it within the host system, which could be a vector for executing remote malicious code.

### Assessment & Resolution

Based on the analysis, it's evident that there are multiple red flags indicating a potentially malicious activity:

- System and PowerShell logs were cleared by an administrative account atypical for routine operations.
- A script executed from PowerShell downloaded content from an external source and interacted with the system registry.
- Unusual handling of process creation related to Windows updates suggests the possibility of being used as a persistence mechanism or a failed update mechanism.
  
### Resolution: **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (`SERVER002`) from the network to prevent further spread or execution of potential malware.
   
2. **Further Forensic Investigation**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation on `SERVER002`, analyzing disk images and memory dumps to identify additional malicious binaries or artifacts.
   - Validate if the external content (e.g., the image download) has additional malware payloads.

3. **Audit and Review Accounts**:
   - Review the activity and permissions of `admin_test` and other administrative accounts, including possible unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

4. **Strengthen Security Posture**:
   - Implement stricter auditing and alerting for log clearing and PowerShell activities.
   - Enforce policies on script execution and network access to mitigate similar incidents in the future.

5. **Communication**:
   - Report the incident to relevant stakeholders and engage with your IT and security teams for coordinated incident response.

6. **Check for Updates**:
   - Ensure all software, particularly browsers like Microsoft Edge, is up-to-date to prevent exploits from known vulnerabilities.

The situation should be addressed promptly to prevent further compromise of network and systems."
Remove Account From Domain Admin Group,"Upon detailed analysis of the provided logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity have been identified:

1. **Log Clearing:** The events indicate that logs from the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security channels were cleared by the user ""admin_test."" This behavior is often associated with attempts to cover tracks following unauthorized or malicious activity.

   - **System Log EventID 104 and Security Log EventID 1102:** These indicate the clearing of logs, which is suspicious, especially if performed unexpectedly or without documentation supporting legitimate use.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:** There is a PowerShell script execution that involves critical changes to user groups, specifically attempting to remove a user from the ""Domain Admins"" group:

   - **Sysmon EventID 1:** Shows the execution of PowerShell with command-line arguments targeting Active Directory groups. The command attempts to remove a user from the ""Domain Admins"" group using a specified credential (`domain\super_user`). This action could potentially be malicious, especially if done without proper approval or awareness.

   - **PowerShell Log Entries:** Confirm the execution of the PowerShell command, which aligns with administrative action on sensitive domain groups.

3. **Multiple `wevtutil` Executions:** Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility were recorded, including clearing logs, which suggests deliberate action to manipulate logs.

4. **Unusual Process Activity:**
   - **Sysmon EventID 1 and 5:** Entries of high-integrity level process executions, such as `wermgr.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `conhost.exe`, initiated by the ""admin_test"" user, not typical for regular operations, especially in quick succession with log clearing.

5. **Hostname and Whoami Executions:** Although not inherently malicious, these can be used within scripts for reconnaissance or validation within unauthorized scripts.

Given these findings, the activity described is highly indicative of a user or actor performing actions to escalate privileges and cover tracks through log clearing. The PowerShell script involved directly manipulating domain admin group membership, which is a significant security risk.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The combination of log clearing, suspicious PowerShell activity, and unusual process execution strongly suggests malicious intent. Immediate action is required to contain and investigate further.

### Recommended Actions:
- **Isolate the affected machine:** To prevent potential lateral movement or further compromise.
- **Perform a full investigation:** Determine the extent of the compromise and assess any data loss or unauthorized changes to AD or other critical systems.
- **Change critical credentials:** Particularly those with elevated privileges that might have been exposed.
- **Conduct a security audit:** Identify how the compromise occurred and improve defenses.
- **Engage with incident response:** Activate the incident response team to handle remediation and recovery."
Delete User - Windows,"After scrutinizing the provided Windows event logs, several activities stand out which warrant attention:

1. **Log File Clearing and Wevtutil Execution**: 
   - There are multiple events indicating the clearing of event logs (Event IDs 104 and 1102), specifically targeting the System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. This is usually a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks. The `wevtutil.exe cl` command was used, suggesting deliberate log clearing activity.
   
2. **Unusual User Account Modifications**:
   - A new user named ""AtomicUser"" was created (Event ID 4720) and then immediately deleted (Event ID 4726) with the use of `net user` commands. This is suspicious because it involves creating and deleting a user account in quick succession, potentially indicating a test account or an account used for a specific purpose such as maintaining temporary access.

3. **High Privilege Processes and Privileges**:
   - The account `admin_test` was observed to have a series of privileged actions and managed to execute processes with a range of privileges (as seen in Event ID 4672). This includes privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, which are typically exploited during privilege escalation attempts.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` was logged with complex command-lines aimed at managing user accounts, which suggests automated or scripted activity potentially part of a malicious script.

5. **Multiple Usage of Administrative Tools**:
   - Tools like `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe` were executed frequently, which are standard tools often leveraged to collect environmental data or to manipulate system settings as part of malicious scripts.

### Conclusion:
The logs contain a sequence of actions that align with typical post-compromise techniques seen in cyber incidents, such as log clearing, suspicious user account manipulation, and execution of administrative tools with elevated privileges. These signs collectively indicate a pattern of malicious activity.

### Recommended Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs present strong indicators of malicious activities including potential intrusion, privilege escalation, and cover-up actions. Immediate actions should include conducting a thorough forensic analysis, isolating the system from the network, changing credentials, and enhancing monitoring to prevent further intrusion attempts."
Overwrite deleted data on C drive,"### Analysis:

Upon reviewing the collection of logs from various sources, several indicators suggest potential suspicious or malicious activities:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The event with ID `1102` from the Security log indicates that the Windows event logs were cleared (`wevtutil.exe cl Security` command in Sysmon logs). This action was performed by the user ""admin_test,"" and the use of `wevtutil` for log clearing is a common method to cover tracks post-compromise.

2. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - Event ID `4672` shows ""admin_test"" acquiring high privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege` and others. This behavior is consistent with actions a threat actor might perform to gain more control over the system.

3. **Execution of `cipher.exe`:**
   - Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `cmd.exe` using `cipher.exe /w:C:` by ""admin_test."" This command is used to securely wipe deleted files on the C drive, potentially indicating an attempt to clean up after illicit activities.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are noted for clearing various event logs, including Application, System, and PowerShell logs. This again suggests attempts to remove forensic evidence.

5. **Timeline and Correlation:**
   - Actions such as log clearing, privilege assignment, and execution of potentially destructive commands are tightly correlated in time, suggesting coordinated actions suggestive of an attempt to hide malicious behavior.

### Assessment:

Given the systematic clearing of logs, acquisition of privileges, and execution of file-wiping commands, these activities are consistent with post-exploitation behaviors of an attacker trying to hide their actions and presence on the system.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate clear malicious activities, including attempts to cover tracks through log clearing and potential data destruction.

### Guidance:

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or damage.
   - Preserve all relevant logs and alert forensic teams for in-depth analysis and evidence collection.
   - Check other systems for similar behaviors or lateral movement by the attacker.

2. **Further Steps:**
   - Perform a thorough investigation of the user ""admin_test"" and all logins and activities associated with it.
   - Review privilege assignments and any recent changes to user accounts or roles.
   - Ensure all backups are intact, and evaluate recovery options for any potentially lost data.
   - Enhance monitoring and protective measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. Consider deploying more robust forensic tools to prevent event log tampering.

Note: Engage incident response teams to follow up on containment, eradication, and recovery efforts."
Data Encrypted with GPG4Win,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following points indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: The logs reveal multiple instances of log files being cleared on ""Server002"" by the user ""admin_test"". This activity is captured in events with EventID 104 in the System log and EventID 1102 in the Security log. The clearing of event logs is a critical indicator of potentially malicious activity as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.

2. **Process Execution and Commands**: There are instances of suspicious command-line operations involving Windows PowerShell and `wevtutil.exe`, indicating attempts to manipulate logs (Sysmon EventID 1). The command line for `wevtutil.exe` operations suggests log clearing across various Windows channels (e.g., Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). `wevtutil.exe cl` is a known command to clear event logs, which corresponds with the cleared logs observed in the System and Security logs.

3. **Use of PowerShell and Encoding Operations**: A particular PowerShell command is logged (Sysmon EventID 1 and Windows PowerShell log EventID 600), where `gpg.exe` is used with PowerShell to encrypt a file in the Temp directory. This combination could indicate an attempt to encrypt files for malicious purposes, such as exfiltrating sensitive data or conducting cryptographic ransom operations.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**: Multiple processes executed by ""admin_test"" were observed running with a high integrity level, an indication of administrative privileges. This includes operations related to `powershell.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and `cmd.exe`, all being utilized in ways that align with log manipulation and potential system compromise activities.

5. **Consistency in User Activity**: The user ""admin_test"" is consistently identified across suspicious activities, including manipulating event logs and executing potentially harmful commands. This persistent involvement across various logs adds to the suspicion.

Given the presence of these indicators:
- Log clearing commands executed by `wevtutil.exe`.
- PowerShell commands that utilize encryption tools like `gpg.exe`.
- High-level privileges used for unusual operations.
- Repeated actions by the user ""admin_test"" to potentially cover tracks and manipulate system commands.

Based on the comprehensive analysis of these logs, we conclude a resolution of **MALICIOUS** activity. This assessment references the repeated and sophisticated nature of the log clearing attempts and use of PowerShell scripts to execute commands potentially harmful to the organization's infrastructure. Immediate actions should include isolating the system, conducting a deeper forensic analysis, and reviewing the user's recent activities to determine any further extent of compromise. It is also advisable to initiate incident response protocols to mitigate and recover from this security event."
ESXi - Terminates VMs using pkill,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs for ""Server002,"" several suspicious activities stand out, indicative of potential malicious behavior:

1. **Log Clearance**
   - The event logs record that several event logs have been cleared: the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs by user `admin_test` using `wevtutil.exe`. The logs cleared include critical security logs, which is a strong indicator of log tampering often associated with malicious activity attempting to hide evidence.

2. **Process Execution**
   - A Sysmon Event ID 1 log shows multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` by the same user (`admin_test`) with high integrity level, which is used to clear event logs.
   - The suspicious execution of `cmd.exe` includes a command involving `plink.exe`, a known tool for creating SSH connections. The command line indicates an attempt to connect to a remote server (""atomic.local"") using credentials (""root"", ""pass"") and a script (`esx_pkill.txt`). This is suggestive of lateral movement or data exfiltration attempts.

3. **Unusual Command-Line Arguments**
   - The command-line argument for `cmd.exe` containing `plink.exe` suggests possible misuse of the tool for unauthorized access (potential persistence or command and control setup).

4. **Privilege and Access**
   - Processes like `C:\\Windows\\System32\\whoami.exe` and `C:\\Windows\\System32\\HOSTNAME.EXE` were executed, potentially to gather system information which aligns with reconnaissance activity.

5. **Suspicious File/Directory Usage**
   - The paths used in the command include `C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam`, which might be indicative of the Atomic Red Team framework being used for testing or exploitation. If unauthorized, this is highly suspicious.

Given these observations, the logs present clear signs of potential malicious activity, particularly the clearing of logs by a non-standard user and remote access attempts using potentially unauthorized tools and scripts.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The activities in the logs indicate a likely system compromise. Immediate response actions should include isolating the affected system, conducting a comprehensive forensic investigation, auditing user access controls, and reviewing network traffic for unauthorized connections. Moreover, remediation steps should address any vulnerabilities and reinforce system monitoring and logging policies."
Windows - vssadmin Resize Shadowstorage Volume,"Based on the provided logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

1. **Event Log Cleared (EventID 1102 in Security Log):**
   - The security log indicates that the logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"" executing from ""SERVER002"". The clearing of security logs can be a sign of malicious activity as attackers often try to cover their tracks. This action demands further scrutiny.

2. **Processes with Admin Privileges (EventID 4672 in Security Log):**
   - There are logs showing that SYSTEM obtained privileges such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeAuditPrivilege, and others around the same time as the suspicious activities. While SYSTEM obtaining privileges is standard due to its nature, in context with other activities such as log clearance, it raises suspicion. 

3. **Wevtutil Usage (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Multiple instances of event log clearing using ""wevtutil.exe"" are recorded. Clearing application, security, and system logs using the command `wevtutil cl` suggests intentional deletion of historical data, often a tactic to remove traces of malicious actions.
   - Event logs indicate `wevtutil.exe` was executed by ""admin_test"" with high integrity, providing further evidence of tampering.

4. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution with VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service):**
   - The PowerShell logs show the execution of a script using a command that modifies the shadow storage size (`vssadmin resize shadowstorage`). While not inherently malicious, alteration of shadow copies, especially in conjunction with log clearance, could be an indicator of a potential ransomware prelude or tampering with shadow copies for data obfuscation or restoration prevention.

5. **Time Reset (EventID 4616 in Security Log):**
   - An event indicates a discrepancy in time, with ""LOCAL SERVICE"" adjusting the system time. Time changes on systems could be indicative of attempts to desynchronize log timestamps or disrupt time-based security mechanisms like Kerberos.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- The logs exhibit multiple indicators of potentially malicious behavior, such as event log clearance, suspicious PowerShell command invocation targeting VSS, and time changes. These actions, especially in combination, suggest an attempt to conduct further unauthorized operations while limiting the traceability of such actions.
- Given the execution context and the actions observed, the scenario mimics techniques commonly seen in post-compromise activities where attackers try to increase their lateral movement capabilities while erasing their footprints.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance:**

- Immediate further investigation is warranted to determine the nature and intent of these activities.
- It is recommended to check for other signs of compromise like unauthorized access, modifications on critical files or directories, and communication attempts to known malicious endpoints.
- Strengthening systems by ensuring audit logs cannot be easily cleared, implementing robust EDR solutions, and employing SIEM monitoring for suspicious activities.
- Review and possibly restrict the access level of the ""admin_test"" account, especially if this account is unnecessary or suspected of compromise.
- Validate the integrity of the VSS (Volume Shadow Copy Service) and ensure backup and restore processes are intact and have not been tampered with."
Windows - Disable Windows Recovery Console Repair,"After analyzing the provided logs, several events indicate suspicious behavior that warrant further investigation:

1. **Event Log Clearing**: There is evidence of event log clearing activities. Specific events related to this activity include the Security log (EventID: 1102, User: admin_test) and System log (EventID: 104) where log files are cleared for several different channels, including Security and System. Clearing event logs is often associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The `wevtutil.exe` utility was executed multiple times to clear different event logs (Security, System, and PowerShell). This behavior is typically unusual for regular system operation and may indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.

3. **Use of `bcdedit.exe`**: The `bcdedit.exe` command was executed with parameters to ignore all boot failures and disable recovery. These system changes can be used to suppress errors and avoid displaying issues during system startup, which is a common tactic used by attackers to persist on a compromised system.

4. **Privilege Level**: The user account `admin_test` is used during these operations, indicating actions taken under administrative privileges, which can further imply unauthorized or rogue admin activity.

5. **Time Service Anomalies**: There are unusual time change events (EventID: 4616) where the system time changes slightly multiple times. These are minor adjustments but could indicate attempts to manipulate system timestamps to hinder forensic analysis.

### Assessment

Based on the above points:

- **Suspicious Behavior**: The clearing of event logs, system configuration changes using `bcdedit.exe`, and time manipulation suggest potentially malicious activities. The administrative user `admin_test` involvement and lack of a benign explanation for these activities increase the suspicion.

### Resolution

The activity observed in the logs is classified as **SUSPICIOUS**. The clearing of log entries, manipulation of system settings using `bcdedit.exe`, and multiple system time changes all suggest attempts at obfuscation, which require further investigation.

### Guidance

To proceed:

- **Preserve Evidence**: Ensure that the environment is secured, and preserve any additional logs and evidence available before further activities can alter them.
- **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Further analyze other system artifacts and investigate other systems that may have been involved or affected. Examine user behavior for `admin_test` and correlate with other logs and data sources.
- **Review and Investigate Anomalous Accounts**: Focus on the `admin_test` account and associated privileges and actions during the timeframe of suspicious activities.
- **Consider Isolation**: Depending on results, consider isolating the system for further investigation and preventing potential lateral movement.
- **Security Posture Review**: Review current security posture and incident response capabilities to ensure rapid detection and response to similar activities in the future."
Configure LegalNoticeCaption and LegalNoticeText registry keys to display ransom message,"Upon a thorough examination of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of potentially malicious activity are present: 

1. **Log File Clearance (Event ID 1102 in Security Log & Event ID 104 in System Log):**
   - The logs show multiple events indicating that the Windows Event Logs have been cleared. This action is often taken by attackers to cover their tracks and hinder forensic investigations. The logs have been cleared for the ""Application"", ""System"", and ""Security"" logs without any backup paths indicating an intentional act to remove traces of activity.

2. **Unexpected Privileged Actions (Event ID 4672):**
   - Multiple events show the granting of special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`. This type of privilege escalation is indicative of attempts to gain higher level access within the system, potentially for executing unauthorized actions.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Command Execution (Sysmon Logs and PowerShell Logs):**
   - A detected PowerShell command modifies the ""LegalNoticeCaption"" and ""LegalNoticeText"" registry keys to include a ransom note. This aligns with ransomware behavior, specifically the PYSA ransomware, indicating encryption of data and demands for payment to restore it. 
   - The PowerShell scripts run with high integrity level, signifying administrative privilege usage.

4. **Suspicious Process Creation (Sysmon Logs):**
   - Processes such as `wevtutil.exe` are executed with commands to clear event logs, which aligns with attempts to erase forensic evidence. 
   - The `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and similar executables are run without apparent legitimate business need around the time of suspicious activities, often used by attackers to gather system information.

5. **Unusual Network Connections (Event ID 4624 in Security Log):**
   - Remote logon events via NTLM authentication were detected, atypically using `LogonType 3`, which indicates network logon. The occurrence of such events, especially in combination with other suspicious behaviors, could suggest lateral movement attempts or unauthorized access.

**Final Assessment: MALICIOUS**

The combination of log cleansing, unauthorized privilege escalation, suspicious PowerShell commands indicative of ransomware, and network reconnaissance commands aligns with typical malicious activities, strongly suggesting a breach and potential ransomware attack (specifically PYSA).

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further spread across the network.
   - Assess potential lateral movements and ensure other machines are secure.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Perform a thorough forensic investigation to determine the initial attack vector and scope of compromise.
   - Recover affected files from backups if available and ensure backups are not compromised.

3. **Remediation and Hardening:**

Akira Ransomware drop Files with .akira Extension and Ransomnote,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, I've identified several indicators that suggest malicious activity on the host machine. Below is a breakdown of the suspicious and malicious activities observed:

### Key Findings:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of the use of `wevtutil` to clear event logs, as seen in the `Sysmon log` and `System log` entries. Clearing event logs is commonly associated with attempts to hide malicious activity or unauthorized actions performed on the system.

2. **Execution of Suspicious PowerShell Commands:**
   - The `Windows PowerShell log` contains evidence of PowerShell activity where a script is executed to create ransom notes (`akira_readme.txt`) and potentially generate encrypted files (e.g., `c:\\test.$_.akira`). This indicates a ransomware attack, specifically linked to a group using the name ""Akira.""

3. **Presence of Ransom Note:**
   - The logs indicate the creation of ransom notes guiding the victim to install Tor browser and access a .onion site to negotiate a ransom payment. This is a clear indication of a ransomware infection.

4. **Privileges and System Time Change:**
   - Elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege`) were obtained by the user `admin_test`, and there are time change events, which could suggest an attempt to reset timestamps to hide the activity.

5. **Network Connection from an External IP:**
   - In the `Security log`, there are logon events originating from an IP address (192.168.0.102) that uses NTLM, which may indicate lateral movement or remote access incident.

6. **Processes with High Integrity Level Executed by `admin_test`:**
   - Several processes executed under the user `admin_test` have a high integrity level, highlighting potential unauthorized administrative actions.

### Assessment:
Given these observations, the behavior noted in these logs strongly suggests a malicious attack, specifically involving ransomware activity. The use of PowerShell for generating ransom notes and engaging with potential encryption, combined with log clearing and elevated privileges, aligns with tactics commonly seen in ransomware deployments.

### Resolution:
- **MALICIOUS**: The activity observed in the logs is consistent with known ransomware behaviors and indicates that the system has been compromised by a ransomware attack.

### Guidance:
- Immediate isolation of the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread.
- Engage incident response procedures to contain and mitigate the attack's impact.
- Collect forensic evidence and consider consulting a cybersecurity expert or contacting law enforcement for assistance, given the high-impact nature of the ransomware.
- Review and strengthen existing backup and recovery strategies to ensure that data can be restored without relying on paying the ransom.
- Conduct a thorough security audit to identify vulnerabilities that allowed the attack to succeed and apply necessary patches and improvements."
Data Encrypt Using DiskCryptor,"After carefully analyzing the provided Windows event logs, I've observed several patterns and behaviors that are indicative of potentially malicious activity, specifically targeting the system and operational integrity. Below is a detailed analysis:

1. **Use of System Utilities**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` being executed are noted with the commands aimed at clearing logs from various channels such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` and `Security`. Execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command-line argument `cl` is specifically used to clear those logs, which is a common practice used by an attacker or malware to cover tracks after conducting malicious activities.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Corresponding `LogFileCleared` events show evidence of log clearing activities by the user account `admin_test`. This action is highly suspicious and a significant red flag, as it's typically performed to erase traces of unauthorized activity. There were events indicating the clearing of `System`, `Application`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs.

3. **Presence of Unusual Command-Line Execution**:
   - Execution of `cmd.exe` with the command: `""cmd.exe"" /c """"%%PROGRAMFILES%%\\dcrypt\\""\\dcrypt.exe""` is suspicious. The command indicates an attempt to execute `dcrypt.exe` which isn’t a standard Windows process and suggests potentially malicious software.
   
4. **Scheduled Program Execution**:
   - Repeated instances of `conhost.exe` being launched - matched as a child process for PowerShell and Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe` - suggests redirecting input/output related to malicious scripts or commands being executed through a script or tool.

5. **Behavior of Elevated Privileges Actions**:
   - There are executed processes under a high integrity level, typically accorded to a system authority level user, which raises suspicion because of the non-system application use and aggressive log clearing commands.

6. **EDR Alert on CEO Machine**:
   - The initial trigger for this investigation was an alert from the Endpoint Detection and Response system related to the CEO’s machine, which amplifies the seriousness of the suspicious activities, especially given they are aligned with techniques used by attackers to obfuscate their operations in an environment.

**Threat Assessment**:
- The combination of these activities demonstrates characteristics of a concerted effort to manipulate or gather access beyond standard administrative scope. Clearing of logs, inappropriate execution of encrypted binaries, and system integrity level processes conducting potentially non-standard operations indicates a potential compromise of the system.

**Resolution**:
- **MALICIOUS**: The behavior seen in these logs unambiguously suggests malicious activity is present. The activities show deliberate actions typically used to mask unauthorized access or to facilitate further system exploitation.

**Guidance on Procedural Response**:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected system(s) from the network to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration.

2. **Detailed Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough root-cause analysis and pursue deeper forensic examinations on the affected host.

3. **Credentials Audit**: Perform an audit of all accounts on affected systems to ensure no backdoor or rogue accesses are established.

4. **Review and Reinforcement**: Review security policies especially around log management and employ more rigorous monitoring mechanisms including enabling more substantial event logging.

5. **Coordinate with Relevant Teams**: Work closely with Incident Response, IT, and potentially involve third-party cybersecurity experts if necessary to remediate and secure the network."
Windows - wbadmin Delete Windows Backup Catalog,"The logs provided give a comprehensive view of activities related to processes, process creation, and system events that occurred on the computer ""Server002."" After a thorough analysis of the logs from various Windows log sources, including Application, Security, System, and Sysmon logs, several suspicious activities stand out:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - **Security Logs Cleared:** Event ID 1102 in the Security log, triggered by user ""admin_test,"" indicates that the security logs were cleared. This is a significant red flag as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks.
   - **System, Application, and PowerShell Logs Cleared:** Events in the System log (Event ID 104) show that logs for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were also cleared by the same user.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution:**
   - **Use of `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet` Command:** The use of the `wbadmin delete catalog -quiet` command, executed through `cmd.exe`, as seen in the Sysmon logs, suggests an attempt to delete backup catalogs quietly. This is suspicious because it implies an effort to remove system recovery options.

3. **Potential Malware Activity:**
   - **Process Execution:** The Sysmon logs show numerous processes being invoked, including `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, `wbengine.exe`, and several EdgeUpdate processes. The frequent creation and use of `wevtutil.exe` is particularly suspicious when associated with clearing logs, as this utility is used for managing Windows event logs.

4. **Privilege Escalation:**
   - **Use of SYSTEM Account:** Several processes, including `wbengine.exe` and `vds.exe`, run under the ""NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"" account with high integrity levels. While not inherently malicious, when combined with the other events, it might suggest privilege escalation techniques were used.

5. **Admin User Activity:**
   - The user ""admin_test"" performed potentially malicious actions, such as clearing logs and executing specific system-level commands.

Given the evidence of log clearing, the use of system commands related to backup deletion, and processes running with SYSTEM privileges, we assess that the logs contain signs of a potential compromise:

- **Assessment:** This indicates potential post-exploitation activity where an intruder may have gained administrative access, attempted to cover their tracks, and removed recovery options.
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance:**
1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system from the network to prevent further potential compromise and lateral movement.
   - Preserve and collect forensic evidence, including memory captures and disk images, to facilitate a deeper forensic analysis.
   
2. **Investigation and Remediation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation of how the attacker gained initial access and close any vulnerabilities.
   - Review user accounts for any unauthorized changes or additions.
   - Reset or revoke credentials for the user ""admin_test"" and any other compromised accounts.

3. **Strengthen Security Posture:**
   - Implement advanced threat protection measures, such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions for better monitoring and alerting.
   - Educate users about security best practices and conduct regular audits for compliance.

4. **Recovery:**
   - Restore any affected systems from backup sources verified not to be compromised.

By following these recommendations, the organization can mitigate any ongoing threat and reduce the risk of future incidents."
Windows - Delete Volume Shadow Copies via WMI with PowerShell,"**Analysis of Logs:**

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - The logs indicate that a PowerShell script was executed on the system with the command `Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}`. This command is used to delete shadow copies on the system. Such activity is atypical unless explicitly required for administrative tasks. Malicious actors often use this command to remove backup copies to prevent recovery from ransomware attacks, indicating potential compromise.

2. **Security Log Activities:**
   - Event ID 1102: Logs show that the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a suspicious activity often associated with attempting to hide malicious activities.
   - Event IDs 4624 and 4672 indicate logons with elevated privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, etc.`) were performed by the user `admin_test`. The use of elevated privileges and NTLM authentication from a remote workstation (`DESKTOP-3HL5B2P`) is suspicious, possibly indicating lateral movement or an attempt to gain further access.

3. **Sysmon Log Observations:**
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` were executed to clear different log channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, `Windows PowerShell`). The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is highly indicative of attempt to obfuscate activities on the system.
   - The execution of normal utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` might be indicative of an attacker trying to gather system information.

4. **System and Application Log Observations:**
   - The system and application logs reflect the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, providing further corroboration of efforts to remove traces of activities.
   - Event ID 24 within the system log shows time adjustments made by `svchost.exe`, which could be benign unless correlating with other suspicious activities.

5. **Indicators of Time Manipulation:**
   - Multiple adjustments to system times were observed, which might indicate an attempt to obscure timelines or modify the system clock to avoid detection or align timestamps with external threat actor communications.

**Assessment and Resolution:**
- The PowerShell execution of a command to delete shadow copies, the multiple instances of event log clearing, coupled with suspicious logon activities imply a high risk of compromise.
- The clearing of security and system logs suggests an attempt to hide actions and further reinforces malicious intent.
- Given these events, along with the alteration of system time and elevated privilege logons, the overall pattern strongly indicates malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected system (`Server002`) to prevent further damage or spread within the network.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the extent of the compromise and identify potential data exfiltration.
- Reset credentials for any affected accounts, especially those with elevated privileges.
- Implement enhanced monitoring to detect unusual activities immediately.
- Review and strengthen security measures, such as patch management, endpoint protection, and network segmentation, to safeguard against future incidents.
- Communicate with legal and compliance teams on potential data breach notifications."
Windows - Stop service by killing process,"Based on a detailed analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several key indicators of potentially anomalous or malicious activity are identified:

1. **Log Clearing Events**: 
   - The system log and security log demonstrate events (EventID 104 and 1102) indicating that the logs were cleared. The user responsible, ""admin_test"", performed these actions in rapid succession. Clearing of logs is a common tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks. This behavior is highly suspicious.

2. **Process Execution and Command-Line Activity**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are executed with the command to clear logs (e.g., ""cl System"", ""cl Application""), suggesting the intention was to remove specific logs.
   - The execution of `taskkill.exe` via `cmd.exe` aimed at forcefully terminating the `spoolsv.exe` process, which is the Print Spooler Service. This action is unusual and may indicate attempts to disrupt normal operations or to evade detection by terminating a service known to be used in certain attack vectors.

3. **Use of Elevated Privileges**:
   - Numerous processes were executed with high integrity levels or SYSTEM authority, suggesting privilege escalation or use of accounts with elevated privileges, such as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

4. **Execution of Utility Tools**:
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` frequently is atypical in a short timeframe, particularly in administrative contexts where these utilities might not commonly be used repeatedly.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to manage logs and the patterns of processes executed under `admin_test`, along with the context of other activities observed, suggest potential manipulation or administrative tasks consistent with post-exploitation strategies.

5. **Edge Update Anomalies**:
   - Multiple entries are related to Microsoft Edge Update activities, which on their own might be benign, but when collated with other observed log clearing activities, should be flagged for further inspection. Considering them in the context of the timeline and other processes, these could be leveraged as part of a broader campaign.

### Conclusion:
The combination of log clearing events, command-line activities aimed at terminating critical services, execution with elevated privileges, and frequent utility executions strongly suggests a concerted effort to cover tracks, potentially part of a malicious campaign targeting this host.

### Assessment:
**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Recommendations:
- Immediately conduct a full forensic investigation on this host to determine the origin and extent of the compromise.
- Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further unauthorized activities and potential lateral movement.
- Review access logs and corroborate with network data to identify potential unauthorized access points or data exfiltration.
- Reinstate logging and monitoring on all hosts network-wide to detect any resurgence of similar activities.
- Patch any vulnerabilities and verify the integrity of other potentially affected systems to prevent further exploitation."
Windows - Stop service using Service Controller,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, certain entries suggest potentially suspicious activities:

1. **Log File Clearing**: 
   - Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104 indicate that event logs have been cleared. This action is commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks post-compromise. The user `admin_test` was involved in clearing the logs. 

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` with different command lines targeting various event logs such as Application, System, and Security. The command sets clear the logs from these channels, and such behavior, especially the clearing of Security logs, is highly suspicious as it might be an effort to remove traces of malicious activity.

3. **Time Change**:
   - The Security and System logs contain Event ID 4616 showing a change in system time. This action is not commonly legitimate and might be used to manipulate timestamps for log clear events or other malicious activities.

4. **Unusual Command Execution**:
   - In the Sysmon log, an instance of `cmd.exe` was spawned with the command `sc.exe stop spooler`. This action might be used in certain attack vectors to disrupt services or prepare the system environment for further exploitation, such as performing a privilege escalation or bypassing certain security checks.

5. **Integrity and Parent Process Context**:
   - Numerous activities were carried out with high integrity level processes indicating administrative privileges. Moreover, actions such as manipulating logs and the processes involved (e.g., `wsmprovhost.exe`) add context that these activities were possibly orchestrated with elevated rights.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Anomalies**:
   - There is a noticeable number of activities around Microsoft Edge Update involving `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. While such activity could be part of normal patch application, in the context of other suspicious activities, it warrants further examination to rule out the exploitation of Edge vulnerabilities or misuse.

### Assessment:
- **SUSPICIOUS**: The logs reflect actions typically aligned with malicious activity, such as log clearing and unauthorized service manipulation. However, without further forensic data or corroborative evidence (e.g., unauthorized file access, network anomalies), we cannot definitively classify this as malicious.
  
### Recommendations:
- **Further Investigation**: Conduct a more in-depth investigation, including:
  - Reviewing the admin_test account's recent activities and access patterns.
  - Checking for unauthorized access or uploads/downloads using this account.
  - Verifying the integrity of critical system files and directories potentially accessed.
  - Monitoring for any residual or ongoing suspicious activities.
  - Correlating network traffic and external communications for any exfiltration patterns.

- **Mitigation Steps**:
  - Consider isolating the system for a comprehensive forensic review.
  - Enhance monitoring of high-value assets and administrative accounts.
  - Consult threat intelligence for any IOC matches to this pattern of behavior.
  
A coordinated response and remediation plan should be developed, incorporating the above findings and aligning with organizational incident response protocols."
Windows - Delete Backup Files,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations can be made:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event ID 104 & 1102):** There are events indicating that various logs (System, Security, and Windows PowerShell) have been cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is typically a red flag for malicious activities as attackers may attempt to hide their tracks by erasing evidence of their actions.

2. **Unusual Command Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1):** There are several suspicious commands executed by the user ""admin_test"":
   - **wevtutil.exe** is used repeatedly to clear event logs, which closely aligns with the log clearing events.
   - **whoami.exe and hostname.exe** executions might be benign on their own but combined with other activities are worth noting.
   - **cmd.exe** is executed with a command to delete various backup files (`del /s /f /q c:\*.VHD c:\*.bac ...`), which is highly suspicious as it involves deleting potentially crucial backup or recovery files.

3. **High-Integrity Level Processes:** Several processes have been run with a high integrity level by ""admin_test"". This suggests the user had administrative privileges, which aligns with the capability to clear logs and execute such critical commands as `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **Legitimate Microsoft Processes and Updates:** Many entries in the logs are related to Microsoft Edge updates and Windows services, which appear legitimate and expected in a Windows environment (e.g., `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`, `sppsvc.exe`). These seem to be routine operations related to updating Microsoft software and don't indicate malicious activity.

5. **Login Activities:** Multiple logon events (Event ID 4624) show system user logins, which are common and usually benign. However, logins by ""admin_test"" with elevated privileges (Event ID 4672) reinforce the potential for misuse of privileges.

6. **Suspicious Deletion Commands:** Commands meant to delete backups and critical files can significantly impact system recovery in the event of a failure or ransomware attack.

**Summary of Findings:**
- The presence of events indicating log clearing and suspicious commands, especially those involving deletion of backups, are strong indicators of malicious behavior.
- The activities conducted by ""admin_test"" suggest misuse of administrative privileges for potentially malicious actions.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately conduct a thorough investigation of the ""admin_test"" account's activities across the network.
- Review Active Directory logs and other systems that may store command-line history or logs that weren't cleared.
- Conduct a forensic analysis of the system to recover deleted logs and files.
- Consider rebuilding or reinstalling affected systems to ensure no backdoors or malicious configurations persist.
- Review your incident response plan and update security protocols to include monitoring for similar activities in the future."
Azure AD - Delete user via Azure CLI,"Upon careful analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious activities and potential indicators of compromise have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - The PowerShell logs contain a command to execute `az login` and delete an Azure Active Directory user with `az ad user delete --id $userprincipalname` using the user `atomicredteam@yourdomain.com`. This behavior can be indicative of malicious use, especially if the executed script is unauthorized or associated with suspicious activities. PowerShell is often used for both legitimate and malicious administrative tasks. However, the specific operation of logging into Azure and deleting a user account is unusual and warrants further investigation, especially from a security standpoint.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Various instances of `wevtutil.exe` being used to clear event logs are observed. The Security, System, and Windows PowerShell event logs were cleared around the same time. The log clear event (`EventID 1102`) from the Security log indicates that the logs were cleared by an account `admin_test`. Clearing logs can be an indication of an attacker trying to cover their tracks, as it is typically not part of standard administrative activity unless it is planned maintenance or troubleshooting.

3. **Privilege Escalation and Usage:**
   - The Security logs indicate that highly privileged operations were performed with `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, among others, being exercised by the `SYSTEM` account (EventID 4672). These privileges are usually associated with administrative tasks. While it's possible that these operations are legitimate, it is essential to ensure they correspond with expected activities because attackers often escalate privileges to `SYSTEM` to perform unauthorized actions.

4. **Suspicious Process Executions:**
   - The Sysmon logs display malicious behavior where `wevtutil.exe` was used multiple times for clearing different event logs (e.g., Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs). The command-line arguments used here directly reference the clearing of logs, which aligns with potential log-tampering activities.

5. **Workflow pattern with `wsmprovhost.exe`:**
   - Most observed activities, including PowerShell executions, have `wsmprovhost.exe` as the parent process, indicating they might have been executed through Windows Remote Management (WinRM). This might align with a form of lateral movement within the network or remote management activity.

**Conclusion and Assessment:**
- **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity of using PowerShell to potentially tamper with an Azure environment, paired with extensive log file clearing using `wevtutil.exe`, strongly indicates malicious behavior, with clear attempts to obscure actions. Privilege escalation signs reinforce suspicion towards potential lateral movement or elevation tactics, frequently seen in targeted cyber-attacks. 

**Guidance on how to proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further unauthorized access and propagation across the network.
   - Review and reset account credentials, particularly for users or processes involved in the suspicious activities.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of the affected system to determine the full extent of the compromise.
   - Review Azure logs and any other relevant logs that were not cleared to identify further unauthorized activities.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Reinforce security controls, such as improved auditing and monitoring capabilites to detect similar behavior in the future.
   - Implement stricter access controls and password policies to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Post-Incident Actions:**
   - Assess the need to notify stakeholders and potentially report the incident to authorities, depending on the severity and impact.
   - Conduct a lesson-learned session to improve incident response strategies and overall cybersecurity posture within the organization."
Windows - wbadmin Delete systemstatebackup,"Upon reviewing the provided logs, several points of interest and potential anomalies stand out that may indicate suspicious activity:

1. **Clearing of Logs:**
   - The `admin_test` user cleared the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs around the same time (Event IDs 1102, 104). Clearing logs is often indicative of nefarious activity as it can be used to cover tracks.

2. **Time Modification:**
   - There are events (Event ID 4616) showing a time modification where the system time is set back. This can be used to manipulate logs or timestamps and is suspicious in combination with the log clearing events.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - Multiple `wevtutil.exe` commands (Event ID 1) listed in the logs were run by the `admin_test` user. The `wevtutil.exe` utility is used to clear or query logs and running it with elevated permissions (High Integrity level) suggests another attempt at log manipulation.

4. **Command-Line Activity:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with the command line `/c wbadmin delete systemstatebackup -keepVersions:0` is highly suspicious. This command deletes all current backups which could potentially be to destroy recovery options.

5. **Privileges Granted:**
   - The user `admin_test` received high privileges including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeBackupPrivilege`, etc., as shown in Event ID 4672. This could indicate deliberate privilege escalation or misuse.

6. **Numerous EdgeUpdate Executions:**
   - Although these could be legitimate updates, the sheer volume and timing, especially in temporary directories, should be investigated further to rule out any misuse.

Logoff System - Windows,"### Detailed Analysis

Let's break down and analyze the provided logs for suspicious or anomalous activity that might indicate malicious behavior:

**Application Log Analysis:**
- The application log entries indicate typical service operations around a software protection platform and edge update service. These entries do not directly display suspicious behavior.

**System Log Analysis:**
- Observations of interest in the system logs include log file clearance events: 
  - The event for clearing the system log is initiated by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
  - The event for clearing the Windows PowerShell log follows immediately afterward, again executed by the same user.
- These actions are suspicious, especially when performed in close succession, potentially indicating an attempt to cover tracks.

**Sysmon Log Analysis:**
- Repeated execution of `C:\Windows\System32\wevtutil.exe` (observed in several Sysmon events) for clearing different log channels (Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell). This aligns with the suspicious behavior in the system logs noted above.
- Subsequent entries show the execution of common utilities such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and eventually a command to execute `shutdown.exe` with a logout command (`/l`), which might indicate other standard activities often linked with user queries or session end operations. However, the context of these actions post log clearance is suspicious.
- `wevtutil.exe` being used in this pattern is often indicative of log manipulation, a common tactic in post-exploitation to remove traces of an attack. 

**Security Log Analysis:**
- An event ID 1102, indicating security log clearance by `SERVER002\admin_test`, is noteworthy as this aligns with potentially obfuscating malicious activities. The clearance of the Security log paired with cleared System and PowerShell logs is a strong indicator of possible malicious intent.

**Windows PowerShell Log:**
- No specific logs were provided in the provided data, but considering the clearance event, it suggests possible PowerShell activities that were expunged.

### Assessment

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
- The clearing of system, security, and PowerShell logs by `admin_test` user is highly abnormal. Log clearance, especially for security and system logs, is a known technique used by adversaries to cover their tracks.
- Utilization of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs further supports suspicions of activity intended to hide potentially malicious processes.

### Recommendations and Resolution

Given the analysis, the indicators strongly suggest an attempt to cover illicit actions through log clearance:

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Incident Response**: Engage incident response procedures to isolate the affected system to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement.
