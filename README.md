# Atomic-EVTX Repository

Welcome to the **Atomic-EVTX Repository**! This repository provides a comprehensive dataset of Windows Event Logs generated from simulated attack scenarios on a Windows 10 system. The attacks were orchestrated using the Atomic Red Team framework, providing a detailed and systematic collection of event logs that capture various stages of the simulated attacks.

## About the Dataset

This dataset contains Windows Event Log (`EVTX`) files, along with their JSON representations, capturing events generated by Sysmon (default configuration), Application, System, Security, and Windows PowerShell logs on the target machine. **In total, 1,064 attack scenarios were simulated** to create this dataset. Refer to the `full_list_of_attacks_simulated.csv` file for a detailed list of simulated attacks. 

In total, the attack category technique and attack count in each category is as follows:

| Attack Cycle Stage | Count of Simulated Techniques |
|--------------|-------|
| Reconnaissance | 1 |
| Initial Access | 12 |
| Exfiltration | 14 |
| Lateral Movement | 21 |
| Collection | 28 |
| Impact | 30 |
| Command-and-Control | 53 |
| Persistence | 60 |
| Execution | 61 |
| Credential Access | 118 |
| Privilege Escalation | 119 |
| Discovery | 180 |
| Defense Evasion | 367 |

The table has been organized in ascending order by count, matching the vertical layout of the original bar chart. Let me know if you'd like the data organized differently!

### Motivation
While similar datasets exist, they are often limited by size, outdated attack simulations, or incomplete logging. The Atomic-EVTX dataset was designed to address these gaps, providing a more extensive, current, and structured dataset to support cybersecurity research and threat analysis.

### `attacks_by_category_unfiltered`
This directory contains **raw, unfiltered EVTX log files** from a Windows 10 VM immediately after each attack simulation. The logs in this directory have not undergone any modifications or filtering. Each EVTX log file is accompanied by a JSON version of the data for versatility in data processing and analysis.

### `attacks_by_category_atomic_removed`
This directory contains **filtered EVTX and JSON logs** where entries specifically related to the Atomic Red Team framework and pre-attack log-clearing events have been removed. Offensive security tool names remain intact in these logs.


Within the JSON logs, the following strings were replaced with a string `data`:
- `atomic`
- `atomics`
- `team`
- `atomic-red-team`
- `redcanary`
- `redcanaryco`
- `canary`
- `atomicredteam`
- `payload`
- `Red team`

Additionally, event entries containing any of the following strings were deleted from the JSON logs (these logs are a residual result of the dataset generation process itself):
- `"wevtutil.exe" cl Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational`
- `"wevtutil.exe" cl Application`
- `"wevtutil.exe" cl System`
- `"wevtutil.exe" cl Security`
- `"wevtutil.exe" cl "Windows PowerShell"`

### **Directory: `attacks_by_category_atomic_and_tools_removed`**  
This directory contains raw EVTX files with JSON logs filtered to exclude entries related to the Atomic Red Team Framework, pre-attack-simulation log-clearing events, and offensive security tool names (e.g., WinPwn.ps1, Meterpreter).

In addition to the data cleaning done for the `attacks_by_category_atomic_removed` logs, the following strings were replaced with the word `file`:
- `WinPwn.ps1`
- `Meterpreter`
- `Empire`
- `Cobalt Strike`
- `Mimikatz`
- `PowerSploit`
- `SharpHound`
- `BloodHound`
- `Responder`
- `S3cur3Th1sSh1t`
- `WinPwn`
- `hlldz`
- `Invoke-Phant0m`
- `PowerSharpPack`
- `Sharpweb`
- `MzHmO`
- `SharpUp`
- `BC-SECURITY`
- `Get-System`
- `Invoke-WMIExec`
- `Kevin-Robertson`
- `obfuscatedps`
- `dccuac.ps1`
- `Invoke-SharpWatson`
- `Rubeus`
- `ExternalPayloads`
- `nanodump`
- `gsecdump`
- `uacme`
- `crackmapexec`
- `phant0m`
- `powerview`
- `uacbypass`
- `Psiphon`
- `exfiltration`
- `dnsexfil.ps1`
- `Invoke-DNSExfiltrator`
- `Invoke-MalDoc`
- `collection`
